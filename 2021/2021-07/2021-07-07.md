**Abstract:** We present SoundStream, a novel neural audio codec that can efficiently compress speech, music and general audio at bitrates normally targeted by speech-tailored codecs. SoundStream relies on a model architecture composed by a fully convolutional encoder/decoder network and a residual vector quantizer, which are trained jointly end-to-end. Training leverages recent advances in text-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and reconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content from quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to quantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from 3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models trained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency implementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a smartphone CPU. In subjective evaluations using audio at 24kHz sampling rate, SoundStream at 3kbps outperforms Opus at 12kbps and approaches EVS at 9.6kbps. Moreover, we are able to perform joint compression and enhancement either at the encoder or at the decoder side with no additional latency, which we demonstrate through background noise suppression for speech.

**Abstract:** We introduce a method for egocentric videoconferencing that enables hands-free video calls, for instance by people wearing smart glasses or other mixed-reality devices. Videoconferencing portrays valuable non-verbal communication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing camera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the move is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the face while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these issues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be integrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and therefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front facing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial neural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric views to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to transfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a complex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related face reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily captured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye movements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get control over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the generator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to synthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally smooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video translation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We demonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against related state-of-the art approaches.

**Abstract:** Over the last several years, end-to-end neural conversational agents have vastly improved in their ability to carry a chit-chat conversation with humans. However, these models are often trained on large datasets from the internet, and as a result, may learn undesirable behaviors from this data, such as toxic or otherwise harmful language. Researchers must thus wrestle with the issue of how and when to release these models. In this paper, we survey the problem landscape for safety for end-to-end conversational AI and discuss recent and related work. We highlight tensions between values, potential positive impact and potential harms, and provide a framework for making decisions about whether and how to release these models, following the tenets of value-sensitive design. We additionally provide a suite of tools to enable researchers to make better-informed decisions about training and releasing end-to-end conversational AI models.

**Abstract:** Due to their increasing spread, confidence in neural network predictions became more and more important. However, basic neural networks do not deliver certainty estimates or suffer from over or under confidence. Many researchers have been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural network's prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty have been identified and a variety of approaches to measure and quantify uncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction, without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. A comprehensive introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their separation into reducible model uncertainty and not reducible data uncertainty is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural networks, Bayesian neural networks, ensemble of neural networks, and test-time data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for the calibration of neural networks and give an overview of existing baselines and implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in different fields give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding uncertainties in practical applications. Additionally, the practical limitations of current methods for mission- and safety-critical real world applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader usage of such methods is given.

**Abstract:** Deep learning models can enable accurate and efficient disease diagnosis, but have thus far been hampered by the data scarcity present in the medical world. Automated diagnosis studies have been constrained by underpowered single-center datasets, and although some results have shown promise, their generalizability to other institutions remains questionable as the data heterogeneity between institutions is not taken into account. By allowing models to be trained in a distributed manner that preserves patients' privacy, federated learning promises to alleviate these issues, by enabling diligent multi-center studies. We present the first federated learning study on the modality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and use four centers derived from subsets of the M\&M and ACDC datasets, focusing on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We adapt a 3D-CNN network pretrained on action recognition and explore two different ways of incorporating shape prior information to the model, and four different data augmentation set-ups, systematically analyzing their impact on the different collaborative learning choices. We show that despite the small size of data (180 subjects derived from four centers), the privacy preserving federated learning achieves promising results that are competitive with traditional centralized learning. We further find that federatively trained models exhibit increased robustness and are more sensitive to domain shift effects.

**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that the performance of machine learning models can vary substantially when models are evaluated on data drawn from a distribution that is close to but different from the training distribution. As a result, predicting model performance on unseen distributions is an important challenge. Our work connects techniques from domain adaptation and predictive uncertainty literature, and allows us to predict model accuracy on challenging unseen distributions without access to labeled data. In the context of distribution shift, distributional distances are often used to adapt models and improve their performance on new domains, however accuracy estimation, or other forms of predictive uncertainty, are often neglected in these investigations. Through investigating a wide range of established distributional distances, such as Frechet distance or Maximum Mean Discrepancy, we determine that they fail to induce reliable estimates of performance under distribution shift. On the other hand, we find that the difference of confidences (DoC) of a classifier's predictions successfully estimates the classifier's performance change over a variety of shifts. We specifically investigate the distinction between synthetic and natural distribution shifts and observe that despite its simplicity DoC consistently outperforms other quantifications of distributional difference. $DoC$ reduces predictive error by almost half ($46\%$) on several realistic and challenging distribution shifts, e.g., on the ImageNet-Vid-Robust and ImageNet-Rendition datasets.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation, the artificial creation of training data for machine learning by transformations, is a widely studied research field across machine learning disciplines. While it is useful for increasing the generalization capabilities of a model, it can also address many other challenges and problems, from overcoming a limited amount of training data over regularizing the objective to limiting the amount data used to protect privacy. Based on a precise description of the goals and applications of data augmentation (C1) and a taxonomy for existing works (C2), this survey is concerned with data augmentation methods for textual classification and aims to achieve a concise and comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners (C3). Derived from the taxonomy, we divided more than 100 methods into 12 different groupings and provide state-of-the-art references expounding which methods are highly promising (C4). Finally, research perspectives that may constitute a building block for future work are given (C5).

**Abstract:** Standard lossy image compression algorithms aim to preserve an image's appearance, while minimizing the number of bits needed to transmit it. However, the amount of information actually needed by a user for downstream tasks -- e.g., deciding which product to click on in a shopping website -- is likely much lower. To achieve this lower bitrate, we would ideally only transmit the visual features that drive user behavior, while discarding details irrelevant to the user's decisions. We approach this problem by training a compression model through human-in-the-loop learning as the user performs tasks with the compressed images. The key insight is to train the model to produce a compressed image that induces the user to take the same action that they would have taken had they seen the original image. To approximate the loss function for this model, we train a discriminator that tries to distinguish whether a user's action was taken in response to the compressed image or the original. We evaluate our method through experiments with human participants on four tasks: reading handwritten digits, verifying photos of faces, browsing an online shopping catalogue, and playing a car racing video game. The results show that our method learns to match the user's actions with and without compression at lower bitrates than baseline methods, and adapts the compression model to the user's behavior: it preserves the digit number and randomizes handwriting style in the digit reading task, preserves hats and eyeglasses while randomizing faces in the photo verification task, preserves the perceived price of an item while randomizing its color and background in the online shopping task, and preserves upcoming bends in the road in the car racing game.

**Abstract:** Interpreting the learning dynamics of neural networks can provide useful insights into how networks learn and the development of better training and design approaches. We present an approach to interpret learning in neural networks by measuring relative weight change on a per layer basis and dynamically aggregating emerging trends through combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering which allows us to scale to very deep networks. We use this approach to investigate learning in the context of vision tasks across a variety of state-of-the-art networks and provide insights into the learning behavior of these networks, including how task complexity affects layer-wise learning in deeper layers of networks.

**Abstract:** This study presents a framework for capturing human attention in the spatio-temporal domain using eye-tracking glasses. Attention mapping is a key technology for human perceptual activity analysis or Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to support human visual cognition; however, measuring human attention in dynamic environments is challenging owing to the difficulty in localizing the subject and dealing with moving objects. To address this, we present a comprehensive framework, 4D Attention, for unified gaze mapping onto static and dynamic objects. Specifically, we estimate the glasses pose by leveraging a loose coupling of direct visual localization and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) values. Further, by installing reconstruction components into our framework, dynamic objects not captured in the 3D environment map are instantiated based on the input images. Finally, a scene rendering component synthesizes a first-person view with identification (ID) textures and performs direct 2D-3D gaze association. Quantitative evaluations showed the effectiveness of our framework. Additionally, we demonstrated the applications of 4D Attention through experiments in real situations.

**Abstract:** The Ladder of Causation describes three qualitatively different types of activities an agent may be interested in engaging in, namely, seeing (observational), doing (interventional), and imagining (counterfactual) (Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018). The inferential challenge imposed by the causal hierarchy is that data is collected by an agent observing or intervening in a system (layers 1 and 2), while its goal may be to understand what would have happened had it taken a different course of action, contrary to what factually ended up happening (layer 3). While there exists a solid understanding of the conditions under which cross-layer inferences are allowed from observations to interventions, the results are somewhat scarcer when targeting counterfactual quantities. In this paper, we study the identification of nested counterfactuals from an arbitrary combination of observations and experiments. Specifically, building on a more explicit definition of nested counterfactuals, we prove the counterfactual unnesting theorem (CUT), which allows one to map arbitrary nested counterfactuals to unnested ones. For instance, applications in mediation and fairness analysis usually evoke notions of direct, indirect, and spurious effects, which naturally require nesting. Second, we introduce a sufficient and necessary graphical condition for counterfactual identification from an arbitrary combination of observational and experimental distributions. Lastly, we develop an efficient and complete algorithm for identifying nested counterfactuals; failure of the algorithm returning an expression for a query implies it is not identifiable.

**Abstract:** Large-scale pretrained language models have led to dramatic improvements in text generation. Impressive performance can be achieved by finetuning only on a small number of instances (few-shot setting). Nonetheless, almost all previous work simply applies random sampling to select the few-shot training instances. Little to no attention has been paid to the selection strategies and how they would affect model performance. In this work, we present a study on training instance selection in few-shot neural text generation. The selection decision is made based only on the unlabeled data so as to identify the most worthwhile data points that should be annotated under some budget of labeling cost. Based on the intuition that the few-shot training instances should be diverse and representative of the entire data distribution, we propose a simple selection strategy with K-means clustering. We show that even with the naive clustering-based approach, the generation models consistently outperform random sampling on three text generation tasks: data-to-text generation, document summarization and question generation. We hope that this work will call for more attention on this largely unexplored area.

**Abstract:** Partition of unity networks (POU-Nets) have been shown capable of realizing algebraic convergence rates for regression and solution of PDEs, but require empirical tuning of training parameters. We enrich POU-Nets with a Gaussian noise model to obtain a probabilistic generalization amenable to gradient-based minimization of a maximum likelihood loss. The resulting architecture provides spatial representations of both noiseless and noisy data as Gaussian mixtures with closed form expressions for variance which provides an estimator of local error. The training process yields remarkably sharp partitions of input space based upon correlation of function values. This classification of training points is amenable to a hierarchical refinement strategy that significantly improves the localization of the regression, allowing for higher-order polynomial approximation to be utilized. The framework scales more favorably to large data sets as compared to Gaussian process regression and allows for spatially varying uncertainty, leveraging the expressive power of deep neural networks while bypassing expensive training associated with other probabilistic deep learning methods. Compared to standard deep neural networks, the framework demonstrates hp-convergence without the use of regularizers to tune the localization of partitions. We provide benchmarks quantifying performance in high/low-dimensions, demonstrating that convergence rates depend only on the latent dimension of data within high-dimensional space. Finally, we introduce a new open-source data set of PDE-based simulations of a semiconductor device and perform unsupervised extraction of a physically interpretable reduced-order basis.

**Abstract:** Urban trees help regulate temperature, reduce energy consumption, improve urban air quality, reduce wind speeds, and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Urban trees also play a key role in climate change mitigation and global warming by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon-dioxide which is the largest contributor to greenhouse gases. Automated tree detection and species classification using aerial imagery can be a powerful tool for sustainable forest and urban tree management. Hence, This study first offers a pipeline for generating labelled dataset of urban trees using Google Map's aerial images and then investigates how state of the art deep Convolutional Neural Network models such as VGG and ResNet handle the classification problem of urban tree aerial images under different parameters. Experimental results show our best model achieves an average accuracy of 60% over 6 tree species.

**Abstract:** Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely used to learn an informative latent representation of a user or item from observed interactions. Existing CF-based methods commonly adopt negative sampling to discriminate different items. That is, observed user-item pairs are treated as positive instances; unobserved pairs are considered as negative instances and are sampled under a defined distribution for training. Training with negative sampling on large datasets is computationally expensive. Further, negative items should be carefully sampled under the defined distribution, in order to avoid selecting an observed positive item in the training dataset. Unavoidably, some negative items sampled from the training dataset could be positive in the test set. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful tool to learn a model without negative samples. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised collaborative filtering framework (SelfCF), that is specially designed for recommender scenario with implicit feedback. The main idea of SelfCF is to augment the output embeddings generated by backbone networks, because it is infeasible to augment raw input of user/item ids. We propose and study three output perturbation techniques that can be applied to different types of backbone networks including both traditional CF models and graph-based models. By encapsulating two popular recommendation models into the framework, our experiments on three datasets show that the best performance of our framework is comparable or better than the supervised counterpart. We also show that SelfCF can boost up the performance by up to 8.93\% on average, compared with another self-supervised framework as the baseline.

**Abstract:** We propose a new gradient-based approach for extracting sub-architectures from a given large model. Contrarily to existing pruning methods, which are unable to disentangle the network architecture and the corresponding weights, our architecture-pruning scheme produces transferable new structures that can be successfully retrained to solve different tasks. We focus on a transfer-learning setup where architectures can be trained on a large data set but very few data points are available for fine-tuning them on new tasks. We define a new gradient-based algorithm that trains architectures of arbitrarily low complexity independently from the attached weights. Given a search space defined by an existing large neural model, we reformulate the architecture search task as a complexity-penalized subset-selection problem and solve it through a two-temperature relaxation scheme. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees and validate the proposed transfer-learning strategy on real data.

**Abstract:** Brain tumor segmentation is a challenging problem in medical image analysis. The endpoint is to generate the salient masks that accurately identify brain tumor regions in an fMRI screening. In this paper, we propose a novel attention gate (AG model) for brain tumor segmentation that utilizes both the edge detecting unit and the attention gated network to highlight and segment the salient regions from fMRI images. This feature enables us to eliminate the necessity of having to explicitly point towards the damaged area(external tissue localization) and classify(classification) as per classical computer vision techniques. AGs can easily be integrated within the deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs). Minimal computional overhead is required while the AGs increase the sensitivity scores significantly. We show that the edge detector along with an attention gated mechanism provide a sufficient enough method for brain segmentation reaching an IOU of 0.78

**Abstract:** In this paper, we hypothesize that the effects of the degree of typicality in natural semantic categories can be generated based on the structure of artificial categories learned with deep learning models. Motivated by the human approach to representing natural semantic categories and based on the Prototype Theory foundations, we propose a novel Computational Prototype Model (CPM) to represent the internal structure of semantic categories. Unlike other prototype learning approaches, our mathematical framework proposes a first approach to provide deep neural networks with the ability to model abstract semantic concepts such as category central semantic meaning, typicality degree of an object's image, and family resemblance relationship. We proposed several methodologies based on the typicality's concept to evaluate our CPM-model in image semantic processing tasks such as image classification, a global semantic description, and transfer learning. Our experiments on different image datasets, such as ImageNet and Coco, showed that our approach might be an admissible proposition in the effort to endow machines with greater power of abstraction for the semantic representation of objects' categories.

**Abstract:** Recently, most of state-of-the-art single image super-resolution (SISR) methods have attained impressive performance by using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The existing SR methods have limited performance due to a fixed degradation settings, i.e. usually a bicubic downscaling of low-resolution (LR) image. However, in real-world settings, the LR degradation process is unknown which can be bicubic LR, bilinear LR, nearest-neighbor LR, or real LR. Therefore, most SR methods are ineffective and inefficient in handling more than one degradation settings within a single network. To handle the multiple degradation, i.e. refers to multi-domain image super-resolution, we propose a deep Super-Resolution Residual StarGAN (SR2*GAN), a novel and scalable approach that super-resolves the LR images for the multiple LR domains using only a single model. The proposed scheme is trained in a StarGAN like network topology with a single generator and discriminator networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in quantitative and qualitative experiments compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Deep learning is found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. However, its adversarial susceptibility in image caption generation is under-explored. We study adversarial examples for vision and language models, which typically adopt an encoder-decoder framework consisting of two major components: a Convolutional Neural Network (i.e., CNN) for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for caption generation. In particular, we investigate attacks on the visual encoder's hidden layer that is fed to the subsequent recurrent network. The existing methods either attack the classification layer of the visual encoder or they back-propagate the gradients from the language model. In contrast, we propose a GAN-based algorithm for crafting adversarial examples for neural image captioning that mimics the internal representation of the CNN such that the resulting deep features of the input image enable a controlled incorrect caption generation through the recurrent network. Our contribution provides new insights for understanding adversarial attacks on vision systems with language component. The proposed method employs two strategies for a comprehensive evaluation. The first examines if a neural image captioning system can be misled to output targeted image captions. The second analyzes the possibility of keywords into the predicted captions. Experiments show that our algorithm can craft effective adversarial images based on the CNN hidden layers to fool captioning framework. Moreover, we discover the proposed attack to be highly transferable. Our work leads to new robustness implications for neural image captioning.

**Abstract:** Reliable perception is essential for robots that interact with the world. But sensors alone are often insufficient to provide this capability, and they are prone to errors due to various conditions in the environment. Furthermore, there is a need for robots to maintain a model of its surroundings even when objects go out of view and are no longer visible. This requires anchoring perceptual information onto symbols that represent the objects in the environment. In this paper, we present a model for action-aware perceptual anchoring that enables robots to track objects in a persistent manner. Our rule-based approach considers inductive biases to perform high-level reasoning over the results from low-level object detection, and it improves the robot's perceptual capability for complex tasks. We evaluate our model against existing baseline models for object permanence and show that it outperforms these on a snitch localisation task using a dataset of 1,371 videos. We also integrate our action-aware perceptual anchoring in the context of a cognitive architecture and demonstrate its benefits in a realistic gearbox assembly task on a Universal Robot.

**Abstract:** Decentralized autonomous organizations as a new form of online governance arecollections of smart contracts deployed on a blockchain platform that intercede groupsof people. A growing number of Decentralized Autonomous Organization Platforms,such as Aragon and Colony, have been introduced in the market to facilitate thedevelopment process of such organizations. Selecting the best fitting platform ischallenging for the organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such aspopularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation ofsuch platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at theorganizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquirevolatile knowledge regarding such platforms and keep themselves updated.Accordingly, a decision model is required to analyze the decision criteria usingsystematic identification and evaluation of potential alternative solutions for adevelopment project. We have developed a theoretical framework to assist softwareengineers with a set of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problems in software production.This study presents a decision model as a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problem forthe decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. Weconducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralizedautonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decisionmodel in assisting decision-makers.

**Abstract:** The volume of flight traffic gets increasing over the time, which makes the strategic traffic flow management become one of the challenging problems since it requires a lot of computational resources to model entire traffic data. On the other hand, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) technology has been considered as a promising data technology to provide both flight crews and ground control staff the necessary information safely and efficiently about the position and velocity of the airplanes in a specific area. In the attempt to tackle this problem, we presented in this paper a simplified framework that can support to detect the typical air routes between airports based on ADS-B data. Specifically, the flight traffic will be classified into major groups based on similarity measures, which helps to reduce the number of flight paths between airports. As a matter of fact, our framework can be taken into account to reduce practically the computational cost for air flow optimization and evaluate the operational performance. Finally, in order to illustrate the potential applications of our proposed framework, an experiment was performed using ADS-B traffic flight data of three different pairs of airports. The detected typical routes between each couple of airports show promising results by virtue of combining two indices for measuring the clustering performance and incorporating human judgment into the visual inspection.

**Abstract:** We propose a semi-supervised learning method for building end-to-end rich transcription-style automatic speech recognition (RT-ASR) systems from small-scale rich transcription-style and large-scale common transcription-style datasets. In spontaneous speech tasks, various speech phenomena such as fillers, word fragments, laughter and coughs, etc. are often included. While common transcriptions do not give special awareness to these phenomena, rich transcriptions explicitly convert them into special phenomenon tokens as well as textual tokens. In previous studies, the textual and phenomenon tokens were simultaneously estimated in an end-to-end manner. However, it is difficult to build accurate RT-ASR systems because large-scale rich transcription-style datasets are often unavailable. To solve this problem, our training method uses a limited rich transcription-style dataset and common transcription-style dataset simultaneously. The Key process in our semi-supervised learning is to convert the common transcription-style dataset into a pseudo-rich transcription-style dataset. To this end, we introduce style tokens which control phenomenon tokens are generated or not into transformer-based autoregressive modeling. We use this modeling for generating the pseudo-rich transcription-style datasets and for building RT-ASR system from the pseudo and original datasets. Our experiments on spontaneous ASR tasks showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** We initiate the use of a multi-layer neural network to model two-sided matching and to explore the design space between strategy-proofness and stability. It is well known that both properties cannot be achieved simultaneously but the efficient frontier in this design space is not understood. We show empirically that it is possible to achieve a good compromise between stability and strategy-proofness-substantially better than that achievable through a convex combination of deferred acceptance (stable and strategy-proof for only one side of the market) and randomized serial dictatorship (strategy-proof but not stable).

<p>

**Abstract:** In this article, we introduce the concept of samplets by transferring the construction of Tausch-White wavelets to the realm of data. This way we obtain a multilevel representation of discrete data which directly enables data compression, detection of singularities and adaptivity. Applying samplets to represent kernel matrices, as they arise in kernel based learning or Gaussian process regression, we end up with quasi-sparse matrices. By thresholding small entries, these matrices are compressible to O(N log N) relevant entries, where N is the number of data points. This feature allows for the use of fill-in reducing reorderings to obtain a sparse factorization of the compressed matrices. Besides the comprehensive introduction to samplets and their properties, we present extensive numerical studies to benchmark the approach. Our results demonstrate that samplets mark a considerable step in the direction of making large data sets accessible for analysis.

**Abstract:** Data imbalance is a ubiquitous problem in machine learning. In large scale collected and annotated datasets, data imbalance is either mitigated manually by undersampling frequent classes and oversampling rare classes, or planned for with imputation and augmentation techniques. In both cases balancing data requires labels. In other words, only annotated data can be balanced. Collecting fully annotated datasets is challenging, especially for large scale satellite systems such as the unlabeled NASA's 35 PB Earth Imagery dataset. Although the NASA Earth Imagery dataset is unlabeled, there are implicit properties of the data source that we can rely on to hypothesize about its imbalance, such as distribution of land and water in the case of the Earth's imagery. We present a new iterative method to balance unlabeled data. Our method utilizes image embeddings as a proxy for image labels that can be used to balance data, and ultimately when trained increases overall accuracy.

**Abstract:** The success of neural network embeddings has entailed a renewed interest in using knowledge graphs for a wide variety of machine learning and information retrieval tasks. In particular, current recommendation methods based on graph embeddings have shown state-of-the-art performance. These methods commonly encode latent rating patterns and content features. Different from previous work, in this paper, we propose to exploit embeddings extracted from graphs that combine information from ratings and aspect-based opinions expressed in textual reviews. We then adapt and evaluate state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques over graphs generated from Amazon and Yelp reviews on six domains, outperforming baseline recommenders. Our approach has the advantage of providing explanations which leverage aspect-based opinions given by users about recommended items. Furthermore, we also provide examples of the applicability of recommendations utilizing aspect opinions as explanations in a visualization dashboard, which allows obtaining information about the most and least liked aspects of similar users obtained from the embeddings of an input graph.

**Abstract:** Contextual bandits are a rich model for sequential decision making given side information, with important applications, e.g., in recommender systems. We propose novel algorithms for contextual bandits harnessing neural networks to approximate the unknown reward function. We resolve the open problem of proving sublinear regret bounds in this setting for general context sequences, considering both fully-connected and convolutional networks. To this end, we first analyze NTK-UCB, a kernelized bandit optimization algorithm employing the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and bound its regret in terms of the NTK maximum information gain $Œ≥_T$, a complexity parameter capturing the difficulty of learning. Our bounds on $Œ≥_T$ for the NTK may be of independent interest. We then introduce our neural network based algorithm NN-UCB, and show that its regret closely tracks that of NTK-UCB. Under broad non-parametric assumptions about the reward function, our approach converges to the optimal policy at a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/2d})$ rate, where $d$ is the dimension of the context.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose deep architectures for learning instance specific abstain (reject option) binary classifiers. The proposed approach uses double sigmoid loss function as described by Kulin Shah and Naresh Manwani in ("Online Active Learning of Reject Option Classifiers", AAAI, 2020), as a performance measure. We show that the double sigmoid loss is classification calibrated. We also show that the excess risk of 0-d-1 loss is upper bounded by the excess risk of double sigmoid loss. We derive the generalization error bounds for the proposed architecture for reject option classifiers. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we experiment with several real world datasets. We observe that the proposed approach not only performs comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches, it is also robust against label noise. We also provide visualizations to observe the important features learned by the network corresponding to the abstaining decision.

**Abstract:** Earlier studies have shown that classification accuracies of Bayesian networks (BNs) obtained by maximizing the conditional log likelihood (CLL) of a class variable, given the feature variables, were higher than those obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood (ML). However, differences between the performances of the two scores in the earlier studies may be attributed to the fact that they used approximate learning algorithms, not exact ones. This paper compares the classification accuracies of BNs with approximate learning using CLL to those with exact learning using ML. The results demonstrate that the classification accuracies of BNs obtained by maximizing the ML are higher than those obtained by maximizing the CLL for large data. However, the results also demonstrate that the classification accuracies of exact learning BNs using the ML are much worse than those of other methods when the sample size is small and the class variable has numerous parents. To resolve the problem, we propose an exact learning augmented naive Bayes classifier (ANB), which ensures a class variable with no parents. The proposed method is guaranteed to asymptotically estimate the identical class posterior to that of the exactly learned BN. Comparison experiments demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** "Embodied visual navigation" problem requires an agent to navigate in a 3D environment mainly rely on its first-person observation. This problem has attracted rising attention in recent years due to its wide application in autonomous driving, vacuum cleaner, and rescue robot. A navigation agent is supposed to have various intelligent skills, such as visual perceiving, mapping, planning, exploring and reasoning, etc. Building such an agent that observes, thinks, and acts is a key to real intelligence. The remarkable learning ability of deep learning methods empowered the agents to accomplish embodied visual navigation tasks. Despite this, embodied visual navigation is still in its infancy since a lot of advanced skills are required, including perceiving partially observed visual input, exploring unseen areas, memorizing and modeling seen scenarios, understanding cross-modal instructions, and adapting to a new environment, etc. Recently, embodied visual navigation has attracted rising attention of the community, and numerous works has been proposed to learn these skills. This paper attempts to establish an outline of the current works in the field of embodied visual navigation by providing a comprehensive literature survey. We summarize the benchmarks and metrics, review different methods, analysis the challenges, and highlight the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we discuss unresolved challenges in the field of embodied visual navigation and give promising directions in pursuing future research.

**Abstract:** Fake reviews and review manipulation are growing problems on online marketplaces globally. Review Hijacking is a new review manipulation tactic in which unethical sellers "hijack" an existing product page (usually one with many positive reviews), then update the product details like title, photo, and description with those of an entirely different product. With the earlier reviews still attached, the new item appears well-reviewed. However, there are no public datasets of review hijacking and little is known in the literature about this tactic. Hence, this paper proposes a three-part study: (i) we propose a framework to generate synthetically labeled data for review hijacking by swapping products and reviews; (ii) then, we evaluate the potential of both a Twin LSTM network and BERT sequence pair classifier to distinguish legitimate reviews from hijacked ones using this data; and (iii) we then deploy the best performing model on a collection of 31K products (with 6.5 M reviews) in the original data, where we find 100s of previously unknown examples of review hijacking.

**Abstract:** With the growing awareness to fairness in machine learning and the realization of the central role that data representation has in data processing tasks, there is an obvious interest in notions of fair data representations. The goal of such representations is that a model trained on data under the representation (e.g., a classifier) will be guaranteed to respect some fairness constraints.
  Such representations are useful when they can be fixed for training models on various different tasks and also when they serve as data filtering between the raw data (known to the representation designer) and potentially malicious agents that use the data under the representation to learn predictive models and make decisions.
  A long list of recent research papers strive to provide tools for achieving these goals.
  However, we prove that this is basically a futile effort. Roughly stated, we prove that no representation can guarantee the fairness of classifiers for different tasks trained using it; even the basic goal of achieving label-independent Demographic Parity fairness fails once the marginal data distribution shifts. More refined notions of fairness, like Odds Equality, cannot be guaranteed by a representation that does not take into account the task specific labeling rule with respect to which such fairness will be evaluated (even if the marginal data distribution is known a priory). Furthermore, except for trivial cases, no representation can guarantee Odds Equality fairness for any two different tasks, while allowing accurate label predictions for both.
  While some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp statements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by many recent works on fair representations.

**Abstract:** Attributed event sequences are commonly encountered in practice. A recent research line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical model -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing with attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good interpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power of neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point processes is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more complicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation phenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural marked point processes is determined by both the network representational ability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two major conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than complicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic assumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of the network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network structure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it can be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the distribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on the conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss with a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection. Experimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and the likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can greatly improve the model performance.

<p>

**Abstract:** In recent years, the use of lithium-ion batteries has greatly expanded into products from many industrial sectors, e.g. cars, power tools or medical devices. An early prediction and robust understanding of battery faults could therefore greatly increase product quality in those fields. While current approaches for data-driven fault prediction provide good results on the exact processes they were trained on, they often lack the ability to flexibly adapt to changes, e.g. in operational or environmental parameters. Continual learning promises such flexibility, allowing for an automatic adaption of previously learnt knowledge to new tasks. Therefore, this article discusses different continual learning approaches from the group of regularization strategies, which are implemented, evaluated and compared based on a real battery wear dataset. Online elastic weight consolidation delivers the best results, but, as with all examined approaches, its performance appears to be strongly dependent on task characteristics and task sequence.

**Abstract:** Shorter product life cycles and increasing individualization of production leads to an increased reconfiguration demand in the domain of industrial automation systems, which will be dominated by cyber-physical production systems in the future. In constantly changing systems, however, not all configuration alternatives of the almost infinite state space are fully understood. Thus, certain configurations can lead to process instability, a reduction in quality or machine failures. Therefore, this paper presents an approach that enhances an intelligent Digital Twin with a self-organized reconfiguration management based on adaptive process models in order to find optimized configurations more comprehensively.

**Abstract:** We present a new probabilistic model to address semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), called Skellam-SNMF. It is a hierarchical generative model consisting of prior components, Skellam-distributed hidden variables and observed data. Two inference algorithms are derived: Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum \emph{a posteriori} estimation and Variational Bayes EM (VBEM) for full Bayesian inference, including the estimation of parameters prior distribution. From this Skellam-based model, we also introduce a new divergence $\mathcal{D}$ between a real-valued target data $x$ and two nonnegative parameters $Œª_{0}$ and $Œª_{1}$ such that $\mathcal{D}\left(x\midŒª_{0},Œª_{1}\right)=0\Leftrightarrow x=Œª_{0}-Œª_{1}$, which is a generalization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Finally, we conduct experimental studies on those new algorithms in order to understand their behavior and prove that they can outperform the classic SNMF approach on real data in a task of automatic clustering.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning paradigm that allows a large number of clients to train a joint model without the need to share their private data. Participants instead only share ephemeral updates necessary to train the model. To ensure the confidentiality of the client updates, Federated Learning systems employ secure aggregation; clients encrypt their gradient updates, and only the aggregated model is revealed to the server. Achieving this level of data protection, however, presents new challenges to the robustness of Federated Learning, i.e., the ability to tolerate failures and attacks. Unfortunately, in this setting, a malicious client can now easily exert influence on the model behavior without being detected. As Federated Learning is being deployed in practice in a range of sensitive applications, its robustness is growing in importance. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding and improving the robustness of secure Federated Learning. We start this paper with a systematic study that evaluates and analyzes existing attack vectors and discusses potential defenses and assesses their effectiveness. We then present RoFL, a secure Federated Learning system that improves robustness against malicious clients through input checks on the encrypted model updates. RoFL extends Federated Learning's secure aggregation protocol to allow expressing a variety of properties and constraints on model updates using zero-knowledge proofs. To enable RoFL to scale to typical Federated Learning settings, we introduce several ML and cryptographic optimizations specific to Federated Learning. We implement and evaluate a prototype of RoFL and show that realistic ML models can be trained in a reasonable time while improving robustness.

**Abstract:** Coastal water quality management is a public health concern, as poor coastal water quality can harbor pathogens that are dangerous to human health. Tourism-oriented countries need to actively monitor the condition of coastal water at tourist popular sites during the summer season. In this study, routine monitoring data of $Escherichia\ Coli$ and enterococci across 15 public beaches in the city of Rijeka, Croatia, were used to build machine learning models for predicting their levels based on environmental parameters as well as to investigate their relationships with environmental stressors. Gradient Boosting (Catboost, Xgboost), Random Forests, Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks were trained with measurements from all sampling sites and used to predict $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci values based on environmental features. The evaluation of stability and generalizability with 10-fold cross validation analysis of the machine learning models, showed that the Catboost algorithm performed best with R$^2$ values of 0.71 and 0.68 for predicting $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci, respectively, compared to other evaluated ML algorithms including Xgboost, Random Forests, Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks. We also use the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique to identify and interpret which features have the most predictive power. The results show that site salinity measured is the most important feature for forecasting both $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci levels. Finally, the spatial and temporal accuracy of both ML models were examined at sites with the lowest coastal water quality. The spatial $E. Coli$ and enterococci models achieved strong R$^2$ values of 0.85 and 0.83, while the temporal models achieved R$^2$ values of 0.74 and 0.67. The temporal model also achieved moderate R$^2$ values of 0.44 and 0.46 at a site with high coastal water quality.

**Abstract:** Gaussian process (GP) model based optimization is widely applied in simulation and machine learning. In general, it first estimates a GP model based on a few observations from the true response and then employs this model to guide the search, aiming to quickly locate the global optimum. Despite its successful applications, it has several limitations that may hinder its broader usage. First, building an accurate GP model can be difficult and computationally expensive, especially when the response function is multi-modal or varies significantly over the design space. Second, even with an appropriate model, the search process can be trapped in suboptimal regions before moving to the global optimum due to the excessive effort spent around the current best solution. In this work, we adopt the Additive Global and Local GP (AGLGP) model in the optimization framework. The model is rooted in the inducing-points-based GP sparse approximations and is combined with independent local models in different regions. With these properties, the AGLGP model is suitable for multi-modal responses with relatively large data sizes. Based on this AGLGP model, we propose a Combined Global and Local search for Optimization (CGLO) algorithm. It first divides the whole design space into disjoint local regions and identifies a promising region with the global model. Next, a local model in the selected region is fit to guide detailed search within this region. The algorithm then switches back to the global step when a good local solution is found. The global and local natures of CGLO enable it to enjoy the benefits of both global and local search to efficiently locate the global optimum.

**Abstract:** Tropical cyclones can be of varied intensity and cause a huge loss of lives and property if the intensity is high enough. Therefore, the prediction of the intensity of tropical cyclones advance in time is of utmost importance. We propose a novel stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) based model architecture to predict the intensity of a tropical cyclone in terms of Maximum surface sustained wind speed (MSWS). The proposed model can predict MSWS well advance in time (up to 72 h) with very high accuracy. We have applied the model on tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean from 1982 to 2018 and checked its performance on two recent tropical cyclones, namely, Fani and Vayu. The model predicts MSWS (in knots) for the next 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours with a mean absolute error of 1.52, 3.66, 5.88, 7.42, 8.96, 10.15, and 11.92, respectively.

**Abstract:** Channel capacity plays a crucial role in the development of modern communication systems as it represents the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel. Nevertheless, for the majority of channels, finding a closed-form capacity expression remains an open challenge. This is because it requires to carry out two formidable tasks a) the computation of the mutual information between the channel input and output, and b) its maximization with respect to the signal distribution at the channel input. In this paper, we address both tasks. Inspired by implicit generative models, we propose a novel cooperative framework to automatically learn the channel capacity, for any type of memory-less channel. In particular, we firstly develop a new methodology to estimate the mutual information directly from a discriminator typically deployed to train adversarial networks, referred to as discriminative mutual information estimator (DIME). Secondly, we include the discriminator in a cooperative channel capacity learning framework, referred to as CORTICAL, where a discriminator learns to distinguish between dependent and independent channel input-output samples while a generator learns to produce the optimal channel input distribution for which the discriminator exhibits the best performance. Lastly, we prove that a particular choice of the cooperative value function solves the channel capacity estimation problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers high accuracy.

**Abstract:** Entity alignment (EA) plays an important role in automatically integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) from multiple sources. Recent approaches based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) obtain entity representation from relation information and have achieved promising results. Besides, more and more methods introduce semi-supervision to ask for more labeled training data. However, two challenges still exist in GNN-based EA methods: (1) Deeper GNN Encoder: The GNN encoder of current methods has limited depth (usually 2-layers). (2) Low-quality Bootstrapping: The generated semi-supervised data is of low quality. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Echo Entity Alignment (EchoEA), which leverages 4-levels self-attention mechanism to spread entity information to relations and echo back to entities. Furthermore, we propose attribute-combined bi-directional global-filtered strategy (ABGS) to improve bootstrapping, reduce false samples and generate high-quality training data. The experimental results on three real-world cross-lingual datasets are stable at around 96\% at hits@1 on average, showing that our approach not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based methods, but also is universal and transferable for existing EA methods.

**Abstract:** We proposed a convolutional neural network for vertex classification on 3-dimensional dental meshes, and used it to detect teeth margins. An expanding layer was constructed to collect statistic values of neighbor vertex features and compute new features for each vertex with convolutional neural networks. An end-to-end neural network was proposed to take vertex features, including coordinates, curvatures and distance, as input and output each vertex classification label. Several network structures with different parameters of expanding layers and a base line network without expanding layers were designed and trained by 1156 dental meshes. The accuracy, recall and precision were validated on 145 dental meshes to rate the best network structures, which were finally tested on another 144 dental meshes. All networks with our expanding layers performed better than baseline, and the best one achieved an accuracy of 0.877 both on validation dataset and test dataset.

**Abstract:** Tropical cyclones are one of the most powerful and destructive natural phenomena on earth. Tropical storms and heavy rains can cause floods, which lead to human lives and economic loss. Devastating winds accompanying cyclones heavily affect not only the coastal regions, even distant areas. Our study focuses on the intensity estimation, particularly cyclone grade and maximum sustained surface wind speed (MSWS) of a tropical cyclone over the North Indian Ocean. We use various machine learning algorithms to estimate cyclone grade and MSWS. We have used the basin of origin, date, time, latitude, longitude, estimated central pressure, and pressure drop as attributes of our models. We use multi-class classification models for the categorical outcome variable, cyclone grade, and regression models for MSWS as it is a continuous variable. Using the best track data of 28 years over the North Indian Ocean, we estimate grade with an accuracy of 88% and MSWS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.3. For higher grade categories (5-7), accuracy improves to an average of 98.84%. We tested our model with two recent tropical cyclones in the North Indian Ocean, Vayu and Fani. For grade, we obtained an accuracy of 93.22% and 95.23% respectively, while for MSWS, we obtained RMSE of 2.2 and 3.4 and $R^2$ of 0.99 and 0.99, respectively.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate the use of Adaptive Stress Testing to detect and address potential vulnerabilities in a financial environment. We develop a simplified model for credit card fraud detection that utilizes a linear regression classifier based on historical payment transaction data coupled with business rules. We then apply the reinforcement learning model known as Adaptive Stress Testing to train an agent, that can be thought of as a potential fraudster, to find the most likely path to system failure -- successfully defrauding the system. We show the connection between this most likely failure path and the limits of the classifier and discuss how the fraud detection system's business rules can be further augmented to mitigate these failure modes.

**Abstract:** Session-based Recommender Systems (SRSs) have been actively developed to recommend the next item of an anonymous short item sequence (i.e., session). Unlike sequence-aware recommender systems where the whole interaction sequence of each user can be used to model both the short-term interest and the general interest of the user, the absence of user-dependent information in SRSs makes it difficult to directly derive the user's general interest from data. Therefore, existing SRSs have focused on how to effectively model the information about short-term interest within the sessions, but they are insufficient to capture the general interest of users. To this end, we propose a novel framework to overcome the limitation of SRSs, named ProxySR, which imitates the missing information in SRSs (i.e., general interest of users) by modeling proxies of sessions. ProxySR selects a proxy for the input session in an unsupervised manner, and combines it with the encoded short-term interest of the session. As a proxy is jointly learned with the short-term interest and selected by multiple sessions, a proxy learns to play the role of the general interest of a user and ProxySR learns how to select a suitable proxy for an input session. Moreover, we propose another real-world situation of SRSs where a few users are logged-in and leave their identifiers in sessions, and a revision of ProxySR for the situation. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that ProxySR considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors, and the proxies successfully imitate the general interest of the users without any user-dependent information.

**Abstract:** The imputation of missing values in time series has many applications in healthcare and finance. While autoregressive models are natural candidates for time series imputation, score-based diffusion models have recently outperformed existing counterparts including autoregressive models in many tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis, and would be promising for time series imputation. In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI improves by 40-65% over existing probabilistic imputation methods on popular performance metrics. In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods. Furthermore, CSDI can also be applied to time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, and is competitive with existing baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/ermongroup/CSDI.

**Abstract:** For robots to understand human instructions and perform meaningful tasks in the near future, it is important to develop learned models that comprehend referential language to identify common objects in real-world 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce a spatial-language model for a 3D visual grounding problem. Specifically, given a reconstructed 3D scene in the form of point clouds with 3D bounding boxes of potential object candidates, and a language utterance referring to a target object in the scene, our model successfully identifies the target object from a set of potential candidates. Specifically, LanguageRefer uses a transformer-based architecture that combines spatial embedding from bounding boxes with fine-tuned language embeddings from DistilBert to predict the target object. We show that it performs competitively on visio-linguistic datasets proposed by ReferIt3D. Further, we analyze its spatial reasoning task performance decoupled from perception noise, the accuracy of view-dependent utterances, and viewpoint annotations for potential robotics applications.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that learning dynamics of neural networks is generically attracted towards a self-organized critical state. The effect can be modeled with quartic interactions between non-trainable variables (e.g. states of neurons) and trainable variables (e.g. weight matrix). Non-trainable variables are rapidly driven towards stochastic equilibrium and trainable variables are slowly driven towards learning equilibrium described by a scale-invariant distribution on a wide range of scales. Our results suggest that the scale invariance observed in many physical and biological systems might be due to some kind of learning dynamics and support the claim that the universe might be a neural network.

**Abstract:** Super-resolution is an innovative technique that upscales the resolution of an image or a video and thus enables us to reconstruct high-fidelity images from low-resolution data. This study performs super-resolution analysis on turbulent flow fields spatially and temporally using various state-of-the-art machine learning techniques like ESPCN, ESRGAN and TecoGAN to reconstruct high-resolution flow fields from low-resolution flow field data, especially keeping in mind the need for low resource consumption and rapid results production/verification. The dataset used for this study is extracted from the 'isotropic 1024 coarse' dataset which is a part of Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases (JHTDB). We have utilized pre-trained models and fine tuned them to our needs, so as to minimize the computational resources and the time required for the implementation of the super-resolution models. The advantages presented by this method far exceed the expectations and the outcomes of regular single structure models. The results obtained through these models are then compared using MSE, PSNR, SAM, VIF and SCC metrics in order to evaluate the upscaled results, find the balance between computational power and output quality, and then identify the most accurate and efficient model for spatial and temporal super-resolution of turbulent flow fields.

**Abstract:** With increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in grid edge including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage, accurate prediction of distributed generation and consumption at the consumer level becomes important. However, DER prediction based on the transmission of customer level data, either repeatedly or in large amounts, is not feasible due to privacy concerns. In this paper, a distributed machine learning approach, Federated Learning, is proposed to carry out DER forecasting using a network of IoT nodes, each of which transmits a model of the consumption and generation patterns without revealing consumer data. We consider a simulation study which includes 1000 DERs, and show that our method leads to an accurate prediction of preserve consumer privacy, while still leading to an accurate forecast. We also evaluate grid-specific performance metrics such as load swings and load curtailment and show that our FL algorithm leads to satisfactory performance. Simulations are also performed on the Pecan street dataset to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach on real data.

**Abstract:** Multimodal brain networks characterize complex connectivities among different brain regions from both structural and functional aspects and provide a new means for mental disease analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a de facto model for analyzing graph-structured data. However, how to employ GNNs to extract effective representations from brain networks in multiple modalities remains rarely explored. Moreover, as brain networks provide no initial node features, how to design informative node attributes and leverage edge weights for GNNs to learn is left unsolved. To this end, we develop a novel multiview GNN for multimodal brain networks. In particular, we regard each modality as a view for brain networks and employ contrastive learning for multimodal fusion. Then, we propose a GNN model which takes advantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree statistics and brain region connectivities. Extensive experiments on two real-world disease datasets (HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** Assigning meaning to parts of image data is the goal of semantic image segmentation. Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is commonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning present in the image data. Towards this, typically a fixed set of labels is specified and experts are tasked with annotating the pixels, patches or segments in the images with the given labels. In general, however, the set of classes does not fully capture the rich semantic information present in the images. For example, in medical imaging such as histology images, the different parts of cells could be grouped and sub-grouped based on the expertise of the pathologist.
  To achieve such a precise semantic representation of the concepts in the image, we need access to the full depth of knowledge of the annotator. In this work, we develop a novel approach to collect segmentation annotations from experts based on psychometric testing. Our method consists of the psychometric testing procedure, active query selection, query enhancement, and a deep metric learning model to achieve a patch-level image embedding that allows for semantic segmentation of images. We show the merits of our method with evaluation on the synthetically generated image, aerial image and histology image.

**Abstract:** Compared with tedious per-pixel mask annotating, it is much easier to annotate data by clicks, which costs only several seconds for an image. However, applying clicks to learn video semantic segmentation model has not been explored before. In this work, we propose an effective weakly-supervised video semantic segmentation pipeline with click annotations, called WeClick, for saving laborious annotating effort by segmenting an instance of the semantic class with only a single click. Since detailed semantic information is not captured by clicks, directly training with click labels leads to poor segmentation predictions. To mitigate this problem, we design a novel memory flow knowledge distillation strategy to exploit temporal information (named memory flow) in abundant unlabeled video frames, by distilling the neighboring predictions to the target frame via estimated motion. Moreover, we adopt vanilla knowledge distillation for model compression. In this case, WeClick learns compact video semantic segmentation models with the low-cost click annotations during the training phase yet achieves real-time and accurate models during the inference period. Experimental results on Cityscapes and Camvid show that WeClick outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, increases performance by 10.24% mIoU than baseline, and achieves real-time execution.

**Abstract:** Android is among the most targeted platform by attackers. While attackers are improving their techniques, traditional solutions based on static and dynamic analysis have been also evolving. In addition to the application code, Android applications have some metadata that could be useful for security analysis of applications. Unlike traditional application distribution mechanisms, Android applications are distributed centrally in mobile markets. Therefore, beside application packages, such markets contain app information provided by app developers and app users. The availability of such useful textual data together with the advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is used to process and understand textual data has encouraged researchers to investigate the use of NLP techniques in Android security. Especially, security solutions based on NLP have accelerated in the last 5 years and proven to be useful. This study reviews these proposals and aim to explore possible research directions for future studies by presenting state-of-the-art in this domain. We mainly focus on NLP-based solutions under four categories: description-to-behaviour fidelity, description generation, privacy and malware detection.

**Abstract:** Coronary artery disease (CAD) has posed a leading threat to the lives of cardiovascular disease patients worldwide for a long time. Therefore, automated diagnosis of CAD has indispensable significance in clinical medicine. However, the complexity of coronary artery plaques that cause CAD makes the automatic detection of coronary artery stenosis in Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a Transformer network (TR-Net) for the automatic detection of significant stenosis (i.e. luminal narrowing > 50%) while practically completing the computer-assisted diagnosis of CAD. The proposed TR-Net introduces a novel Transformer, and tightly combines convolutional layers and Transformer encoders, allowing their advantages to be demonstrated in the task. By analyzing semantic information sequences, TR-Net can fully understand the relationship between image information in each position of a multiplanar reformatted (MPR) image, and accurately detect significant stenosis based on both local and global information. We evaluate our TR-Net on a dataset of 76 patients from different patients annotated by experienced radiologists. Experimental results illustrate that our TR-Net has achieved better results in ACC (0.92), Spec (0.96), PPV (0.84), F1 (0.79) and MCC (0.74) indicators compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** In an effort to improve user satisfaction and transit image, transit service providers worldwide offer delay compensations. Smart card data enables the estimation of passenger delays throughout the network and aid in monitoring service performance. Notwithstanding, in order to prioritize measures for improving service reliability and hence reducing passenger delays, it is paramount to identify the system components - stations and track segments - where most passenger delay occurs. To this end, we propose a novel method for estimating network passenger delay from individual trajectories. We decompose the delay along a passenger trajectory into its corresponding track segment delay, initial waiting time and transfer delay. We distinguish between two different types of passenger delay in relation to the public transit network: average passenger delay and total passenger delay. We employ temporal clustering on these two quantities to reveal daily and seasonal regularity in delay patterns of the transit network. The estimation and clustering methods are demonstrated on one year of data from Washington metro network. The data consists of schedule information and smart card data which includes passenger-train assignment of the metro network for the months of August 2017 to August 2018. Our findings show that the average passenger delay is relatively stable throughout the day. The temporal clustering reveals pronounced and recurrent and thus predictable daily and weekly patterns with distinct characteristics for certain months.

**Abstract:** Financial markets tend to switch between various market regimes over time, making stationarity-based models unsustainable. We construct a regime-switching model independent of asset classes for risk-adjusted return predictions based on hidden Markov models. This framework can distinguish between market regimes in a wide range of financial markets such as the commodity, currency, stock, and fixed income market. The proposed method employs sticky features that directly affect the regime stickiness and thereby changing turnover levels. An investigation of our metric for risk-adjusted return predictions is conducted by analyzing daily financial market changes for almost twenty years. Empirical demonstrations of out-of-sample observations obtain an accurate detection of bull, bear, and high volatility periods, improving risk-adjusted returns while keeping a preferable turnover level.

**Abstract:** We propose a feature generator backbone composed of an ensemble of convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) to improve the recently emerging Vision Transformer (ViT) models. We tackled the RSNA intracranial hemorrhage classification problem, i.e., identifying various hemorrhage types from computed tomography (CT) slices. We show that by gradually stacking several feature maps extracted using multiple Xception CNNs, we can develop a feature-rich input for the ViT model. Our approach allowed the ViT model to pay attention to relevant features at multiple levels. Moreover, pretraining the n CNNs using various paradigms leads to a diverse feature set and further improves the performance of the proposed n-CNN-ViT. We achieved a test accuracy of 98.04% with a weighted logarithmic loss value of 0.0708. The proposed architecture is modular and scalable in both the number of CNNs used for feature extraction and the size of the ViT.

**Abstract:** Forecasting stock returns is a challenging problem due to the highly stochastic nature of the market and the vast array of factors and events that can influence trading volume and prices. Nevertheless it has proven to be an attractive target for machine learning research because of the potential for even modest levels of prediction accuracy to deliver significant benefits. In this paper, we describe a case-based reasoning approach to predicting stock market returns using only historical pricing data. We argue that one of the impediments for case-based stock prediction has been the lack of a suitable similarity metric when it comes to identifying similar pricing histories as the basis for a future prediction -- traditional Euclidean and correlation based approaches are not effective for a variety of reasons -- and in this regard, a key contribution of this work is the development of a novel similarity metric for comparing historical pricing data. We demonstrate the benefits of this metric and the case-based approach in a real-world application in comparison to a variety of conventional benchmarks.

**Abstract:** This work investigates the problem of learning temporal interaction networks. A temporal interaction network consists of a series of chronological interactions between users and items. Previous methods tackle this problem by using different variants of recurrent neural networks to model sequential interactions, which fail to consider the structural information of temporal interaction networks and inevitably lead to sub-optimal results. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Structural Point Process termed as DSPP for learning temporal interaction networks. DSPP simultaneously incorporates the topological structure and long-range dependency structure into our intensity function to enhance model expressiveness. To be specific, by using the topological structure as a strong prior, we first design a topological fusion encoder to obtain node embeddings. An attentive shift encoder is then developed to learn the long-range dependency structure between users and items in continuous time. The proposed two modules enable our model to capture the user-item correlation and dynamic influence in temporal interaction networks. DSPP is evaluated on three real-world datasets for both tasks of item prediction and time prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of model selection for the general stochastic contextual bandits under the realizability assumption. We propose a successive refinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\ttfamily ACB}), that works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too simple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive, i.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, the state-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs knowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model class is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the regret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller as the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show that a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a regret rate of matching that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the true model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as opposed to in {\ttfamily ACB}, as expected. Furthermore, {\ttfamily ACB} applied to the linear bandit setting with unknown sparsity, order-wise recovers the model selection guarantees previously established by algorithms tailored to the linear setting.

**Abstract:** In large studies involving multi protocol Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), it can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to poor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway interrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are unavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the imaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a challenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed by the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Multi-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute one or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the subjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one network for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks to mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on all the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor segmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing. Our experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing sub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE model for segmentation tasks.

**Abstract:** It is widely perceived that leveraging the success of modern machine learning techniques to mobile devices and wireless networks has the potential of enabling important new services. This, however, poses significant challenges, essentially due to that both data and processing power are highly distributed in a wireless network. In this paper, we develop a learning algorithm and an architecture that make use of multiple data streams and processing units, not only during the training phase but also during the inference phase. In particular, the analysis reveals how inference propagates and fuses across a network. We study the design criterion of our proposed method and its bandwidth requirements. Also, we discuss implementation aspects using neural networks in typical wireless radio access; and provide experiments that illustrate benefits over state-of-the-art techniques.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a novel method and a practical approach to predicting early onsets of sleep syndromes, including restless leg syndrome, insomnia, based on an algorithm that is comprised of two modules. A Fast Fourier Transform is applied to 30 seconds long epochs of EEG recordings to provide localized time-frequency information, and a deep convolutional LSTM neural network is trained for sleep stage classification. Automating sleep stages detection from EEG data offers great potential to tackling sleep irregularities on a daily basis. Thereby, a novel approach for sleep stage classification is proposed which combines the best of signal processing and statistics. In this study, we used the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database. The code evaluation showed impressive results, reaching an accuracy of 86.43, precision of 77.76, recall of 93,32, F1-score of 89.12 with the final mean false error loss of 0.09.

**Abstract:** The success of neural network embeddings has entailed a renewed interest in using knowledge graphs for a wide variety of machine learning and information retrieval tasks. In particular, recent recommendation methods based on graph embeddings have shown state-of-the-art performance. In general, these methods encode latent rating patterns and content features. Differently from previous work, in this paper, we propose to exploit embeddings extracted from graphs that combine information from ratings and aspect-based opinions expressed in textual reviews. We then adapt and evaluate state-of-the-art graph embedding techniques over graphs generated from Amazon and Yelp reviews on six domains, outperforming baseline recommenders. Additionally, our method has the advantage of providing explanations that involve the coverage of aspect-based opinions given by users about recommended items.

**Abstract:** In this study, we investigated a method allowing the determination of the femur bone surface as well as its mechanical axis from some easy-to-identify bony landmarks. The reconstruction of the whole femur is therefore performed from these landmarks using a Statistical Shape Model (SSM). The aim of this research is therefore to assess the impact of the number, the position, and the accuracy of the landmarks for the reconstruction of the femur and the determination of its related mechanical axis, an important clinical parameter to consider for the lower limb analysis. Two statistical femur models were created from our in-house dataset and a publicly available dataset. Both were evaluated in terms of average point-to-point surface distance error and through the mechanical axis of the femur. Furthermore, the clinical impact of using landmarks on the skin in replacement of bony landmarks is investigated. The predicted proximal femurs from bony landmarks were more accurate compared to on-skin landmarks while both had less than 3.5 degrees mechanical axis angle deviation error. The results regarding the non-invasive determination of the mechanical axis are very encouraging and could open very interesting clinical perspectives for the analysis of the lower limb either for orthopedics or functional rehabilitation.

**Abstract:** Inverse reinforcement learning is a paradigm motivated by the goal of learning general reward functions from demonstrated behaviours. Yet the notion of generality for learnt costs is often evaluated in terms of robustness to various spatial perturbations only, assuming deployment at fixed speeds of execution. However, this is impractical in the context of robotics and building, time-invariant solutions is of crucial importance. In this work, we propose a formulation that allows us to 1) vary the length of execution by learning time-invariant costs, and 2) relax the temporal alignment requirements for learning from demonstration. We apply our method to two different types of cost formulations and evaluate their performance in the context of learning reward functions for simulated placement and peg in hole tasks executed on a 7DoF Kuka IIWA arm. Our results show that our approach enables learning temporally invariant rewards from misaligned demonstration that can also generalise spatially to out of distribution tasks.

**Abstract:** The combination of deep learning image analysis methods and large-scale imaging datasets offers many opportunities to imaging neuroscience and epidemiology. However, despite the success of deep learning when applied to many neuroimaging tasks, there remain barriers to the clinical translation of large-scale datasets and processing tools. Here, we explore the main challenges and the approaches that have been explored to overcome them. We focus on issues relating to data availability, interpretability, evaluation and logistical challenges, and discuss the challenges we believe are still to be overcome to enable the full success of big data deep learning approaches to be experienced outside of the research field.

**Abstract:** AI language models trained on Web data generate prose that reflects human knowledge and public sentiments, but can also contain novel insights and predictions. We asked the world's best language model, GPT-3, fifteen difficult questions about the nature, value, and future of library and information science (LIS), topics that receive perennial attention from LIS scholars. We present highlights from its 45 different responses, which range from platitudes and caricatures to interesting perspectives and worrisome visions of the future, thus providing an LIS-tailored demonstration of the current performance of AI language models. We also reflect on the viability of using AI to forecast or generate research ideas in this way today. Finally, we have shared the full response log online for readers to consider and evaluate for themselves.

**Abstract:** Dynamical systems with binary-valued observations are widely used in information industry, technology of biological pharmacy and other fields. Though there have been much efforts devoted to the identification of such systems, most of the previous investigations are based on first-order gradient algorithm which usually has much slower convergence rate than the Quasi-Newton algorithm. Moreover, persistence of excitation(PE) conditions are usually required to guarantee consistent parameter estimates in the existing literature, which are hard to be verified or guaranteed for feedback control systems. In this paper, we propose an online projected Quasi-Newton type algorithm for parameter estimation of stochastic regression models with binary-valued observations and varying thresholds. By using both the stochastic Lyapunov function and martingale estimation methods, we establish the strong consistency of the estimation algorithm and provide the convergence rate, under a signal condition which is considerably weaker than the traditional PE condition and coincides with the weakest possible excitation known for the classical least square algorithm of stochastic regression models. Convergence of adaptive predictors and their applications in adaptive control are also discussed.

**Abstract:** We investigate resource allocation scheme to reduce the energy consumption of federated learning (FL) in the integrated fog-cloud computing enabled Internet-of-things (IoT) networks. In the envisioned system, IoT devices are connected with the centralized cloud server (CS) via multiple fog access points (F-APs). We consider two different scenarios for training the local models. In the first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs upload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local models are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT devices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model parameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both scenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint optimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power allocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and decouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT device scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we optimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a conflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems. Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable performance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented simulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at the IoT devices instead of the F-APs.

**Abstract:** We study federated edge learning, where a global model is trained collaboratively using privacy-sensitive data at the edge of a wireless network. A parameter server (PS) keeps track of the global model and shares it with the wireless edge devices for training using their private local data. The devices then transmit their local model updates, which are used to update the global model, to the PS. The algorithm, which involves transmission over PS-to-device and device-to-PS links, continues until the convergence of the global model or lack of any participating devices. In this study, we consider device selection based on downlink channels over which the PS shares the global model with the devices. Performing digital downlink transmission, we design a partial device participation framework where a subset of the devices is selected for training at each iteration. Therefore, the participating devices can have a better estimate of the global model compared to the full device participation case which is due to the shared nature of the broadcast channel with the price of updating the global model with respect to a smaller set of data. At each iteration, the PS broadcasts different quantized global model updates to different participating devices based on the last global model estimates available at the devices. We investigate the best number of participating devices through experimental results for image classification using the MNIST dataset with biased distribution.

**Abstract:** Federated learning has been explored as a promising solution for training at the edge, where end devices collaborate to train models without sharing data with other entities. Since the execution of these learning models occurs at the edge, where resources are limited, new solutions must be developed. In this paper, we describe the recent work on resource management at the edge, and explore the challenges and future directions to allow the execution of federated learning at the edge. Some of the problems of this management, such as discovery of resources, deployment, load balancing, migration, and energy efficiency will be discussed in the paper.

**Abstract:** Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has been the subject of extensive recent research. A specific form of fairness is supplier exposure fairness where the objective is to ensure equitable coverage of items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. This is especially important in multistakeholder recommendation scenarios where it may be important to optimize utilities not just for the end-user, but also for other stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair representation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes accomplished by attempting to increasing aggregate diversity in order to mitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in recommendations. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based algorithm that works as a post processing approach after recommendation generation to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm iteratively adds high quality items that have low visibility or items from suppliers with low exposure to the users' final recommendation lists. A comprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improves exposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of relevance of the recommendations.

**Abstract:** AIoT processors fabricated with newer technology nodes suffer rising soft errors due to the shrinking transistor sizes and lower power supply. Soft errors on the AIoT processors particularly the deep learning accelerators (DLAs) with massive computing may cause substantial computing errors. These computing errors are difficult to be captured by the conventional training on general purposed processors like CPUs and GPUs in a server. Applying the offline trained neural network models to the edge accelerators with errors directly may lead to considerable prediction accuracy loss.
  To address the problem, we propose a remote retraining framework (R2F) for remote AIoT processors with computing errors. It takes the remote AIoT processor with soft errors in the training loop such that the on-site computing errors can be learned with the application data on the server and the retrained models can be resilient to the soft errors. Meanwhile, we propose an optimized partial TMR strategy to enhance the retraining. According to our experiments, R2F enables elastic design trade-offs between the model accuracy and the performance penalty. The top-5 model accuracy can be improved by 1.93%-13.73% with 0%-200% performance penalty at high fault error rate. In addition, we notice that the retraining requires massive data transmission and even dominates the training time, and propose a sparse increment compression approach for the data transmission optimization, which reduces the retraining time by 38%-88% on average with negligible accuracy loss over a straightforward remote retraining.

**Abstract:** Purpose. Elevations in initially obtained serum lactate levels are strong predictors of mortality in critically ill patients. Identifying patients whose serum lactate levels are more likely to increase can alert physicians to intensify care and guide them in the frequency of tending the blood test. We investigate whether machine learning models can predict subsequent serum lactate changes.
  Methods. We investigated serum lactate change prediction using the MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets in internal as well as external validation of the eICU cohort on the MIMIC-III cohort. Three subgroups were defined based on the initial lactate levels: i) normal group (<2 mmol/L), ii) mild group (2-4 mmol/L), and iii) severe group (>4 mmol/L). Outcomes were defined based on increase or decrease of serum lactate levels between the groups. We also performed sensitivity analysis by defining the outcome as lactate change of >10% and furthermore investigated the influence of the time interval between subsequent lactate measurements on predictive performance.
  Results. The LSTM models were able to predict deterioration of serum lactate values of MIMIC-III patients with an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.762-0.771) for the normal group, 0.77 (95% CI 0.768-0.772) for the mild group, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.840-0.851) for the severe group, with a slightly lower performance in the external validation.
  Conclusion. The LSTM demonstrated good discrimination of patients who had deterioration in serum lactate levels. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate whether utilization of a clinical decision support tool based on these results could positively impact decision-making and patient outcomes.

**Abstract:** Shift neural networks reduce computation complexity by removing expensive multiplication operations and quantizing continuous weights into low-bit discrete values, which are fast and energy efficient compared to conventional neural networks. However, existing shift networks are sensitive to the weight initialization, and also yield a degraded performance caused by vanishing gradient and weight sign freezing problem. To address these issues, we propose S low-bit re-parameterization, a novel technique for training low-bit shift networks. Our method decomposes a discrete parameter in a sign-sparse-shift 3-fold manner. In this way, it efficiently learns a low-bit network with a weight dynamics similar to full-precision networks and insensitive to weight initialization. Our proposed training method pushes the boundaries of shift neural networks and shows 3-bit shift networks out-performs their full-precision counterparts in terms of top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

**Abstract:** Optimization is often cast as a deterministic problem, where the solution is found through some iterative procedure such as gradient descent. However, when training neural networks the loss function changes over (iteration) time due to the randomized selection of a subset of the samples. This randomization turns the optimization problem into a stochastic one. We propose to consider the loss as a noisy observation with respect to some reference optimum. This interpretation of the loss allows us to adopt Kalman filtering as an optimizer, as its recursive formulation is designed to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurements. Moreover, we show that the Kalman Filter dynamical model for the evolution of the unknown parameters can be used to capture the gradient dynamics of advanced methods such as Momentum and Adam. We call this stochastic optimization method KOALA, which is short for Kalman Optimization Algorithm with Loss Adaptivity. KOALA is an easy to implement, scalable, and efficient method to train neural networks. We provide convergence analysis and show experimentally that it yields parameter estimates that are on par with or better than existing state of the art optimization algorithms across several neural network architectures and machine learning tasks, such as computer vision and language modeling.

**Abstract:** We establish an equivalence between the $\ell_2$-regularized solution path for a convex loss function, and the solution of an ordinary differentiable equation (ODE). Importantly, this equivalence reveals that the solution path can be viewed as the flow of a hybrid of gradient descent and Newton method applying to the empirical loss, which is similar to a widely used optimization technique called trust region method. This provides an interesting algorithmic view of $\ell_2$ regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view that the $\ell_2$ regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow of the empirical loss.New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods and numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution path. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient descent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish their approximation error rates over the solution path. Importantly, our theory suggests novel schemes to choose grid points that guarantee an arbitrarily small suboptimality for the solution path. In terms of computational cost, we prove that in order to achieve an $Œµ$-suboptimality for the entire solution path, the number of Newton steps required for the Newton method is $\mathcal O(Œµ^{-1/2})$, while the number of gradient steps required for the gradient descent method is $\mathcal O\left(Œµ^{-1} \ln(Œµ^{-1})\right)$. Finally, we use $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression as an illustrating example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed path-following algorithms.

**Abstract:** Quantifying uncertainty in model predictions is a common goal for practitioners seeking more than just point predictions. One tool for uncertainty quantification that requires minimal assumptions is conformal inference, which can help create probabilistically valid prediction regions for black box models. Classical conformal prediction only provides marginal validity, whereas in many situations locally valid prediction regions are desirable. Deciding how best to partition the feature space X when applying localized conformal prediction is still an open question. We present MD-split+, a practical local conformal approach that creates X partitions based on localized model performance of conditional density estimation models. Our method handles complex real-world data settings where such models may be misspecified, and scales to high-dimensional inputs. We discuss how our local partitions philosophically align with expected behavior from an unattainable conditional conformal inference approach. We also empirically compare our method against other local conformal approaches.
