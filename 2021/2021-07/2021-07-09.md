**Abstract:** We show that many machine-learning algorithms are specific instances of a single algorithm called the Bayesian learning rule. The rule, derived from Bayesian principles, yields a wide-range of algorithms from fields such as optimization, deep learning, and graphical models. This includes classical algorithms such as ridge regression, Newton's method, and Kalman filter, as well as modern deep-learning algorithms such as stochastic-gradient descent, RMSprop, and Dropout. The key idea in deriving such algorithms is to approximate the posterior using candidate distributions estimated by using natural gradients. Different candidate distributions result in different algorithms and further approximations to natural gradients give rise to variants of those algorithms. Our work not only unifies, generalizes, and improves existing algorithms, but also helps us design new ones.

**Abstract:** Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown competitive performance on image recognition while requiring less vision-specific inductive biases. In this paper, we investigate if such observation can be extended to image generation. To this end, we integrate the ViT architecture into generative adversarial networks (GANs). We observe that existing regularization methods for GANs interact poorly with self-attention, causing serious instability during training. To resolve this issue, we introduce novel regularization techniques for training GANs with ViTs. Empirically, our approach, named ViTGAN, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNN-based StyleGAN2 on CIFAR-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom datasets.

**Abstract:** Imitation learning has been widely used to learn control policies for autonomous driving based on pre-recorded data. However, imitation learning based policies have been shown to be susceptible to compounding errors when encountering states outside of the training distribution. Further, these agents have been demonstrated to be easily exploitable by adversarial road users aiming to create collisions. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce Adversarial Mixture Density Networks (AMDN), which learns two distributions from separate datasets. The first is a distribution of safe actions learned from a dataset of naturalistic human driving. The second is a distribution representing unsafe actions likely to lead to collision, learned from a dataset of collisions. During training, we leverage these two distributions to provide an additional loss based on the similarity of the two distributions. By penalising the safe action distribution based on its similarity to the unsafe action distribution when training on the collision dataset, a more robust and safe control policy is obtained. We demonstrate the proposed AMDN approach in a vehicle following use-case, and evaluate under naturalistic and adversarial testing environments. We show that despite its simplicity, AMDN provides significant benefits for the safety of the learned control policy, when compared to pure imitation learning or standard mixture density network approaches.

**Abstract:** Model explainability is essential for the creation of trustworthy Machine Learning models in healthcare. An ideal explanation resembles the decision-making process of a domain expert and is expressed using concepts or terminology that is meaningful to the clinicians. To provide such an explanation, we first associate the hidden units of the classifier to clinically relevant concepts. We take advantage of radiology reports accompanying the chest X-ray images to define concepts. We discover sparse associations between concepts and hidden units using a linear sparse logistic regression. To ensure that the identified units truly influence the classifier's outcome, we adopt tools from Causal Inference literature and, more specifically, mediation analysis through counterfactual interventions. Finally, we construct a low-depth decision tree to translate all the discovered concepts into a straightforward decision rule, expressed to the radiologist. We evaluated our approach on a large chest x-ray dataset, where our model produces a global explanation consistent with clinical knowledge.

<p>

**Abstract:** In the present study, we propose to implement a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process to extend an existing GAN framework and develop a white-box controllable image cartoonization, which can generate high-quality cartooned images/videos from real-world photos and videos. The learning purposes of our system are based on three distinct representations: surface representation, structure representation, and texture representation. The surface representation refers to the smooth surface of the images. The structure representation relates to the sparse colour blocks and compresses generic content. The texture representation shows the texture, curves, and features in cartoon images. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework decomposes the images into different representations and learns from them to generate cartoon images. This decomposition makes the framework more controllable and flexible which allows users to make changes based on the required output. This approach overcomes any previous system in terms of maintaining clarity, colours, textures, shapes of images yet showing the characteristics of cartoon images.

**Abstract:** One of the challenges in a task oriented natural language application like the Google Assistant, Siri, or Alexa is to localize the output to many languages. This paper explores doing this by applying machine translation to the English output. Using machine translation is very scalable, as it can work with any English output and can handle dynamic text, but otherwise the problem is a poor fit. The required quality bar is close to perfection, the range of sentences is extremely narrow, and the sentences are often very different than the ones in the machine translation training data. This combination of requirements is novel in the field of domain adaptation for machine translation. We are able to reach the required quality bar by building on existing ideas and adding new ones: finetuning on in-domain translations, adding sentences from the Web, adding semantic annotations, and using automatic error detection. The paper shares our approach and results, together with a distillation model to serve the translation models at scale.

**Abstract:** Bandit problems with linear or concave reward have been extensively studied, but relatively few works have studied bandits with non-concave reward. This work considers a large family of bandit problems where the unknown underlying reward function is non-concave, including the low-rank generalized linear bandit problems and two-layer neural network with polynomial activation bandit problem. For the low-rank generalized linear bandit problem, we provide a minimax-optimal algorithm in the dimension, refuting both conjectures in [LMT21, JWWN19]. Our algorithms are based on a unified zeroth-order optimization paradigm that applies in great generality and attains optimal rates in several structured polynomial settings (in the dimension). We further demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms in RL in the generative model setting, resulting in improved sample complexity over prior approaches. Finally, we show that the standard optimistic algorithms (e.g., UCB) are sub-optimal by dimension factors. In the neural net setting (with polynomial activation functions) with noiseless reward, we provide a bandit algorithm with sample complexity equal to the intrinsic algebraic dimension. Again, we show that optimistic approaches have worse sample complexity, polynomial in the extrinsic dimension (which could be exponentially worse in the polynomial degree).

**Abstract:** Many joint entity relation extraction models setup two separated label spaces for the two sub-tasks (i.e., entity detection and relation classification). We argue that this setting may hinder the information interaction between entities and relations. In this work, we propose to eliminate the different treatment on the two sub-tasks' label spaces. The input of our model is a table containing all word pairs from a sentence. Entities and relations are represented by squares and rectangles in the table. We apply a unified classifier to predict each cell's label, which unifies the learning of two sub-tasks. For testing, an effective (yet fast) approximate decoder is proposed for finding squares and rectangles from tables. Experiments on three benchmarks (ACE04, ACE05, SciERC) show that, using only half the number of parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy with the best extractor, and is faster.

**Abstract:** Generating future frames given a few context (or past) frames is a challenging task. It requires modeling the temporal coherence of videos and multi-modality in terms of diversity in the potential future states. Current variational approaches for video generation tend to marginalize over multi-modal future outcomes. Instead, we propose to explicitly model the multi-modality in the future outcomes and leverage it to sample diverse futures. Our approach, Diverse Video Generator, uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to learn priors on future states given the past and maintains a probability distribution over possible futures given a particular sample. In addition, we leverage the changes in this distribution over time to control the sampling of diverse future states by estimating the end of ongoing sequences. That is, we use the variance of GP over the output function space to trigger a change in an action sequence. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse future frame generation in terms of reconstruction quality and diversity of the generated sequences.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in robot learning have enabled robots to become increasingly better at mastering a predefined set of tasks. On the other hand, as humans, we have the ability to learn a growing set of tasks over our lifetime. Continual robot learning is an emerging research direction with the goal of endowing robots with this ability. In order to learn new tasks over time, the robot first needs to infer the task at hand. Task inference, however, has received little attention in the multi-task learning literature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to continual learning of robotic control tasks. Our approach performs unsupervised learning of behavior embeddings by incrementally self-organizing demonstrated behaviors. Task inference is made by finding the nearest behavior embedding to a demonstrated behavior, which is used together with the environment state as input to a multi-task policy trained with reinforcement learning to optimize performance over tasks. Unlike previous approaches, our approach makes no assumptions about task distribution and requires no task exploration to infer tasks. We evaluate our approach in experiments with concurrently and sequentially presented tasks and show that it outperforms other multi-task learning approaches in terms of generalization performance and convergence speed, particularly in the continual learning setting.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have demonstrated their capability to learn control policies for a variety of tasks. However, these neural network-based policies have been shown to be susceptible to exploitation by adversarial agents. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques to learn control policies that are robust against adversaries. We introduce Adversarially Robust Control (ARC), which trains the protagonist policy and the adversarial policy end-to-end on the same loss. The aim of the protagonist is to maximise this loss, whilst the adversary is attempting to minimise it. We demonstrate the proposed ARC training in a highway driving scenario, where the protagonist controls the follower vehicle whilst the adversary controls the lead vehicle. By training the protagonist against an ensemble of adversaries, it learns a significantly more robust control policy, which generalises to a variety of adversarial strategies. The approach is shown to reduce the amount of collisions against new adversaries by up to 90.25%, compared to the original policy. Moreover, by utilising an auxiliary distillation loss, we show that the fine-tuned control policy shows no drop in performance across its original training distribution.

**Abstract:** Uncertainty quantification for deep neural networks has recently evolved through many techniques. In this work, we revisit Laplace approximation, a classical approach for posterior approximation that is computationally attractive. However, instead of computing the curvature matrix, we show that, under some regularity conditions, the Laplace approximation can be easily constructed using the gradient second moment. This quantity is already estimated by many exponential moving average variants of Adagrad such as Adam and RMSprop, but is traditionally discarded after training. We show that our method (L2M) does not require changes in models or optimization, can be implemented in a few lines of code to yield reasonable results, and it does not require any extra computational steps besides what is already being computed by optimizers, without introducing any new hyperparameter. We hope our method can open new research directions on using quantities already computed by optimizers for uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks.

**Abstract:** A unique cognitive capability of humans consists in their ability to acquire new knowledge and skills from a sequence of experiences. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence systems are good at learning only the last given task without being able to remember the databases learnt in the past. We propose a novel lifelong learning methodology by employing a Teacher-Student network framework. While the Student module is trained with a new given database, the Teacher module would remind the Student about the information learnt in the past. The Teacher, implemented by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), is trained to preserve and replay past knowledge corresponding to the probabilistic representations of previously learn databases. Meanwhile, the Student module is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which infers its latent variable representation from both the output of the Teacher module as well as from the newly available database. Moreover, the Student module is trained to capture both continuous and discrete underlying data representations across different domains. The proposed lifelong learning framework is applied in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised training. The code is available~: \url{https://github.com/dtuzi123/Lifelong-Teacher-Student-Network-Learning}

**Abstract:** Randomized smoothing has recently emerged as an effective tool that enables certification of deep neural network classifiers at scale. All prior art on randomized smoothing has focused on isotropic $\ell_p$ certification, which has the advantage of yielding certificates that can be easily compared among isotropic methods via $\ell_p$-norm radius. However, isotropic certification limits the region that can be certified around an input to worst-case adversaries, i.e., it cannot reason about other "close", potentially large, constant prediction safe regions. To alleviate this issue, (i) we theoretically extend the isotropic randomized smoothing $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certificates to their generalized anisotropic counterparts following a simplified analysis. Moreover, (ii) we propose evaluation metrics allowing for the comparison of general certificates - a certificate is superior to another if it certifies a superset region - with the quantification of each certificate through the volume of the certified region. We introduce ANCER, a practical framework for obtaining anisotropic certificates for a given test set sample via volume maximization. Our empirical results demonstrate that ANCER achieves state-of-the-art $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ certified accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple radii, while certifying substantially larger regions in terms of volume, thus highlighting the benefits of moving away from isotropic analysis. Code used in our experiments is available in https://github.com/MotasemAlfarra/ANCER.

**Abstract:** Explainability is becoming an important requirement for organizations that make use of automated decision-making due to regulatory initiatives and a shift in public awareness. Various and significantly different algorithmic methods to provide this explainability have been introduced in the field, but the existing literature in the machine learning community has paid little attention to the stakeholder whose needs are rather studied in the human-computer interface community. Therefore, organizations that want or need to provide this explainability are confronted with the selection of an appropriate method for their use case. In this paper, we argue there is a need for a methodology to bridge the gap between stakeholder needs and explanation methods. We present our ongoing work on creating this methodology to help data scientists in the process of providing explainability to stakeholders. In particular, our contributions include documents used to characterize XAI methods and user requirements (shown in Appendix), which our methodology builds upon.

**Abstract:** One of the major prerequisites for any deep learning approach is the availability of large-scale training data. When dealing with scanned document images in real world scenarios, the principal information of its content is stored in the layout itself. In this work, we have proposed an automated deep generative model using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate synthetic data with highly variable and plausible document layouts that can be used to train document interpretation systems, in this case, specially in digital mailroom applications. It is also the first graph-based approach for document layout generation task experimented on administrative document images, in this case, invoices.

**Abstract:** Recently proposed self-supervised learning approaches have been successful for pre-training speech representation models. The utility of these learned representations has been observed empirically, but not much has been studied about the type or extent of information encoded in the pre-trained representations themselves. Developing such insights can help understand the capabilities and limits of these models and enable the research community to more efficiently develop their usage for downstream applications. In this work, we begin to fill this gap by examining one recent and successful pre-trained model (wav2vec 2.0), via its intermediate representation vectors, using a suite of analysis tools. We use the metrics of canonical correlation, mutual information, and performance on simple downstream tasks with non-parametric probes, in order to (i) query for acoustic and linguistic information content, (ii) characterize the evolution of information across model layers, and (iii) understand how fine-tuning the model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) affects these observations. Our findings motivate modifying the fine-tuning protocol for ASR, which produces improved word error rates in a low-resource setting.

**Abstract:** Fundus photography has routinely been used to document the presence and severity of retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in clinical practice, for which the fovea and optic disc (OD) are important retinal landmarks. However, the occurrence of lesions, drusen, and other retinal abnormalities during retinal degeneration severely complicates automatic landmark detection and segmentation. Here we propose HBA-U-Net: a U-Net backbone enriched with hierarchical bottleneck attention. The network consists of a novel bottleneck attention block that combines and refines self-attention, channel attention, and relative-position attention to highlight retinal abnormalities that may be important for fovea and OD segmentation in the degenerated retina. HBA-U-Net achieved state-of-the-art results on fovea detection across datasets and eye conditions (ADAM: Euclidean Distance (ED) of 25.4 pixels, REFUGE: 32.5 pixels, IDRiD: 32.1 pixels), on OD segmentation for AMD (ADAM: Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.947), and on OD detection for DR (IDRiD: ED of 20.5 pixels). Our results suggest that HBA-U-Net may be well suited for landmark detection in the presence of a variety of retinal degenerative diseases.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new continuously learning generative model, called the Lifelong Twin Generative Adversarial Networks (LT-GANs). LT-GANs learns a sequence of tasks from several databases and its architecture consists of three components: two identical generators, namely the Teacher and Assistant, and one Discriminator. In order to allow for the LT-GANs to learn new concepts without forgetting, we introduce a new lifelong training approach, namely Lifelong Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (LAKD), which encourages the Teacher and Assistant to alternately teach each other, while learning a new database. This training approach favours transferring knowledge from a more knowledgeable player to another player which knows less information about a previously given task.

**Abstract:** Learning disentangled and interpretable representations is an important step towards accomplishing comprehensive data representations on the manifold. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning algorithm which combines the inference abilities of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with the generalization capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The proposed model, called InfoVAEGAN, consists of three networks~: Encoder, Generator and Discriminator. InfoVAEGAN aims to jointly learn discrete and continuous interpretable representations in an unsupervised manner by using two different data-free log-likelihood functions onto the variables sampled from the generator's distribution. We propose a two-stage algorithm for optimizing the inference network separately from the generator training. Moreover, we enforce the learning of interpretable representations through the maximization of the mutual information between the existing latent variables and those created through generative and inference processes.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an end-to-end lifelong learning mixture of experts. Each expert is implemented by a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The experts in the mixture system are jointly trained by maximizing a mixture of individual component evidence lower bounds (MELBO) on the log-likelihood of the given training samples. The mixing coefficients in the mixture, control the contributions of each expert in the goal representation. These are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are determined through non-parametric estimation during lifelong learning. The model can learn new tasks fast when these are similar to those previously learnt. The proposed Lifelong mixture of VAE (L-MVAE) expands its architecture with new components when learning a completely new task. After the training, our model can automatically determine the relevant expert to be used when fed with new data samples. This mechanism benefits both the memory efficiency and the required computational cost as only one expert is used during the inference. The L-MVAE inference model is able to perform interpolation in the joint latent space across the data domains associated with different tasks and is shown to be efficient for disentangled learning representation.

**Abstract:** We examine interval estimation of the effect of a treatment T on an outcome Y given the existence of an unobserved confounder U. Using HÃ¶lder's inequality, we derive a set of bounds on the confounding bias |E[Y|T=t]-E[Y|do(T=t)]| based on the degree of unmeasured confounding (i.e., the strength of the connection U->T, and the strength of U->Y). These bounds are tight either when U is independent of T or when U is independent of Y given T (when there is no unobserved confounding). We focus on a special case of this bound depending on the total variation distance between the distributions p(U) and p(U|T=t), as well as the maximum (over all possible values of U) deviation of the conditional expected outcome E[Y|U=u,T=t] from the average expected outcome E[Y|T=t]. We discuss possible calibration strategies for this bound to get interval estimates for treatment effects, and experimentally validate the bound using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.

**Abstract:** Heteroscedastic regression is the task of supervised learning where each label is subject to noise from a different distribution. This noise can be caused by the labelling process, and impacts negatively the performance of the learning algorithm as it violates the i.i.d. assumptions. In many situations however, the labelling process is able to estimate the variance of such distribution for each label, which can be used as an additional information to mitigate this impact. We adapt an inverse-variance weighted mean square error, based on the Gauss-Markov theorem, for parameter optimization on neural networks. We introduce Batch Inverse-Variance, a loss function which is robust to near-ground truth samples, and allows to control the effective learning rate. Our experimental results show that BIV improves significantly the performance of the networks on two noisy datasets, compared to L2 loss, inverse-variance weighting, as well as a filtering-based baseline.

**Abstract:** Continual learning-the ability to learn many tasks in sequence-is critical for artificial learning systems. Yet standard training methods for deep networks often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks erases knowledge of earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the problem, the theoretical reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear. Here, we attempt to narrow this gap between theory and practice by studying continual learning in the teacher-student setup. We extend previous analytical work on two-layer networks in the teacher-student setup to multiple teachers. Using each teacher to represent a different task, we investigate how the relationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting and transfer exhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent work, we find that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity leads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in which tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to disentangle task similarity at the level of readouts (hidden-to-output weights) and features (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between both types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum transfer/forgetting, and long-term transfer/forgetting. Together, these results help illuminate the diverse factors contributing to catastrophic forgetting.

**Abstract:** Normalizing flows leverage the Change of Variables Formula (CVF) to define flexible density models. Yet, the requirement of smooth transformations (diffeomorphisms) in the CVF poses a significant challenge in the construction of these models. To enlarge the design space of flows, we introduce $\mathcal{L}$-diffeomorphisms as generalized transformations which may violate these requirements on zero Lebesgue-measure sets. This relaxation allows e.g. the use of non-smooth activation functions such as ReLU. Finally, we apply the obtained results to planar, radial, and contractive residual flows.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose Attention Based Decomposition Network (ABD-Net), for point cloud decomposition into basic geometric shapes namely, plane, sphere, cone and cylinder. We show improved performance of 3D object classification using attention features based on primitive shapes in point clouds. Point clouds, being the simple and compact representation of 3D objects have gained increasing popularity. They demand robust methods for feature extraction due to unorderness in point sets. In ABD-Net the proposed Local Proximity Encapsulator captures the local geometric variations along with spatial encoding around each point from the input point sets. The encapsulated local features are further passed to proposed Attention Feature Encoder to learn basic shapes in point cloud. Attention Feature Encoder models geometric relationship between the neighborhoods of all the points resulting in capturing global point cloud information. We demonstrate the results of our proposed ABD-Net on ANSI mechanical component and ModelNet40 datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of ABD-Net over the acquired attention features by improving the performance of 3D object classification on ModelNet40 benchmark dataset and compare them with state-of-the-art techniques.

**Abstract:** For machine learning systems to be reliable, we must understand their performance in unseen, out-of-distribution environments. In this paper, we empirically show that out-of-distribution performance is strongly correlated with in-distribution performance for a wide range of models and distribution shifts. Specifically, we demonstrate strong correlations between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance on variants of CIFAR-10 & ImageNet, a synthetic pose estimation task derived from YCB objects, satellite imagery classification in FMoW-WILDS, and wildlife classification in iWildCam-WILDS. The strong correlations hold across model architectures, hyperparameters, training set size, and training duration, and are more precise than what is expected from existing domain adaptation theory. To complete the picture, we also investigate cases where the correlation is weaker, for instance some synthetic distribution shifts from CIFAR-10-C and the tissue classification dataset Camelyon17-WILDS. Finally, we provide a candidate theory based on a Gaussian data model that shows how changes in the data covariance arising from distribution shift can affect the observed correlations.

**Abstract:** Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) has been widely used to create lower order, computationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems. Using these representations, ROMs can efficiently model flow fields while using significantly lesser parameters. Conventional ROMs accomplish this by linearly projecting higher-order manifolds to lower-dimensional space using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). In this work, we develop a novel deep learning framework DL-ROM (Deep Learning - Reduced Order Modelling) to create a neural network capable of non-linear projections to reduced order states. We then use the learned reduced state to efficiently predict future time steps of the simulation using 3D Autoencoder and 3D U-Net based architectures. Our model DL-ROM is able to create highly accurate reconstructions from the learned ROM and is thus able to efficiently predict future time steps by temporally traversing in the learned reduced state. All of this is achieved without ground truth supervision or needing to iteratively solve the expensive Navier-Stokes(NS) equations thereby resulting in massive computational savings. To test the effectiveness and performance of our approach, we evaluate our implementation on five different Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets using reconstruction performance and computational runtime metrics. DL-ROM can reduce the computational runtimes of iterative solvers by nearly two orders of magnitude while maintaining an acceptable error threshold.

**Abstract:** Guideline-based treatment for sepsis and septic shock is difficult because sepsis is a disparate range of life-threatening organ dysfunctions whose pathophysiology is not fully understood. Early intervention in sepsis is crucial for patient outcome, yet those interventions have adverse effects and are frequently overadministered. Greater personalization is necessary, as no single action is suitable for all patients. We present a novel application of reinforcement learning in which we identify optimal recommendations for sepsis treatment from data, estimate their confidence level, and identify treatment options infrequently observed in training data. Rather than a single recommendation, our method can present several treatment options. We examine learned policies and discover that reinforcement learning is biased against aggressive intervention due to the confounding relationship between mortality and level of treatment received. We mitigate this bias using subspace learning, and develop methodology that can yield more accurate learning policies across healthcare applications.

**Abstract:** The recent popularity growth of Deep Learning (DL) re-ignited the interest towards traffic classification, with several studies demonstrating the accuracy of DL-based classifiers to identify Internet applications' traffic. Even with the aid of hardware accelerators (GPUs, TPUs), DL model training remains expensive, and limits the ability to operate frequent model updates necessary to fit to the ever evolving nature of Internet traffic, and mobile traffic in particular. To address this pain point, in this work we explore Incremental Learning (IL) techniques to add new classes to models without a full retraining, hence speeding up model's updates cycle. We consider iCarl, a state of the art IL method, and MIRAGE-2019, a public dataset with traffic from 40 Android apps, aiming to understand "if there is a case for incremental learning in traffic classification". By dissecting iCarl internals, we discuss ways to improve its design, contributing a revised version, namely iCarl+. Despite our analysis reveals their infancy, IL techniques are a promising research area on the roadmap towards automated DL-based traffic analysis systems.

**Abstract:** The process of aggregation is ubiquitous in almost all deep nets models. It functions as an important mechanism for consolidating deep features into a more compact representation, whilst increasing robustness to overfitting and providing spatial invariance in deep nets. In particular, the proximity of global aggregation layers to the output layers of DNNs mean that aggregated features have a direct influence on the performance of a deep net. A better understanding of this relationship can be obtained using information theoretic methods. However, this requires the knowledge of the distributions of the activations of aggregation layers. To achieve this, we propose a novel mathematical formulation for analytically modelling the probability distributions of output values of layers involved with deep feature aggregation. An important outcome is our ability to analytically predict the KL-divergence of output nodes in a DNN. We also experimentally verify our theoretical predictions against empirical observations across a range of different classification tasks and datasets.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning is finding its way to real-world problem application, transferring from simulated environments to physical setups. In this work, we implement vision-based alignment of an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a confocal telescope in one arm, which controls the diameter and divergence of the corresponding beam. We use a continuous action space; exponential scaling enables us to handle actions within a range of over two orders of magnitude. Our agent trains only in a simulated environment with domain randomizations. In an experimental evaluation, the agent significantly outperforms an existing solution and a human expert.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art temporal action detectors to date are based on two-stream input including RGB frames and optical flow. Although combining RGB frames and optical flow boosts performance significantly, optical flow is a hand-designed representation which not only requires heavy computation, but also makes it methodologically unsatisfactory that two-stream methods are often not learned end-to-end jointly with the flow. In this paper, we argue that optical flow is dispensable in high-accuracy temporal action detection and image level data augmentation (ILDA) is the key solution to avoid performance degradation when optical flow is removed. To evaluate the effectiveness of ILDA, we design a simple yet efficient one-stage temporal action detector based on single RGB stream named DaoTAD. Our results show that when trained with ILDA, DaoTAD has comparable accuracy with all existing state-of-the-art two-stream detectors while surpassing the inference speed of previous methods by a large margin and the inference speed is astounding 6668 fps on GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

**Abstract:** In many applications of computer graphics, art and design, it is desirable for a user to provide intuitive non-image input, such as text, sketch, stroke, graph or layout, and have a computer system automatically generate photo-realistic images that adhere to the input content. While classic works that allow such automatic image content generation have followed a framework of image retrieval and composition, recent advances in deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and flow-based methods have enabled more powerful and versatile image generation tasks. This paper reviews recent works for image synthesis given intuitive user input, covering advances in input versatility, image generation methodology, benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics. This motivates new perspectives on input representation and interactivity, cross pollination between major image generation paradigms, and evaluation and comparison of generation methods.

**Abstract:** Neural approaches have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on machine translation but suffer from the high cost of collecting large scale parallel data. Thus, a lot of research has been conducted for neural machine translation (NMT) with very limited parallel data, i.e., the low-resource setting. In this paper, we provide a survey for low-resource NMT and classify related works into three categories according to the auxiliary data they used: (1) exploiting monolingual data of source and/or target languages, (2) exploiting data from auxiliary languages, and (3) exploiting multi-modal data. We hope that our survey can help researchers to better understand this field and inspire them to design better algorithms, and help industry practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms for their applications.

**Abstract:** Adaptation of a classifier to new domains is one of the challenging problems in machine learning. This has been addressed using many deep and non-deep learning based methods. Among the methodologies used, that of adversarial learning is widely applied to solve many deep learning problems along with domain adaptation. These methods are based on a discriminator that ensures source and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather than using a point estimate obtaining by a single discriminator, it would be useful if a distribution based on ensembles of discriminators could be used to bridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using traditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo dropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution based discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout discriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based distribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the source and target feature representations. An ensemble of discriminators helps the model to learn the data distribution efficiently. It also provides a better gradient estimates to train the feature extractor. The detailed results and thorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** As both machine learning models and the datasets on which they are evaluated have grown in size and complexity, the practice of using a few summary statistics to understand model performance has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly true in real-world scenarios where understanding model failure on certain subpopulations of the data is of critical importance. In this paper we propose a topological framework for evaluating machine learning models in which a dataset is treated as a "space" on which a model operates. This provides us with a principled way to organize information about model performance at both the global level (over the entire test set) and also the local level (on specific subpopulations). Finally, we describe a topological data structure, presheaves, which offer a convenient way to store and analyze model performance between different subpopulations.

**Abstract:** Owing to the remarkable capability of extracting effective graph embeddings, graph convolutional network (GCN) and its variants have been successfully applied to a broad range of tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Traditional GCN models suffer from the issues of overfitting and oversmoothing, while some recent techniques like DropEdge could alleviate these issues and thus enable the development of deep GCN. However, training GCN models is non-trivial, as it is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters such as dropout rate and learning weight decay, especially for deep GCN models. In this paper, we aim to automate the training of GCN models through hyperparameter optimization. To be specific, we propose a self-tuning GCN approach with an alternate training algorithm, and further extend our approach by incorporating the population based training scheme. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on optimizing multi-layer GCN, compared with several representative baselines.

**Abstract:** Financial markets and more generally macro-economic models involve a large number of individuals interacting through variables such as prices resulting from the aggregate behavior of all the agents. Mean field games have been introduced to study Nash equilibria for such problems in the limit when the number of players is infinite. The theory has been extensively developed in the past decade, using both analytical and probabilistic tools, and a wide range of applications have been discovered, from economics to crowd motion. More recently the interaction with machine learning has attracted a growing interest. This aspect is particularly relevant to solve very large games with complex structures, in high dimension or with common sources of randomness. In this chapter, we review the literature on the interplay between mean field games and deep learning, with a focus on three families of methods. A special emphasis is given to financial applications.

**Abstract:** Autonomous navigation in dense traffic scenarios remains challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving behaviors. To maneuver through dense traffic, AVs must be able to reason how their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to navigate through dense traffic safely. This paper presents a novel framework for interaction-aware motion planning in dense traffic scenarios. We explore the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior to pro-actively merge in dense traffic while remaining safe in case the other vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an optimization-based method. The presented results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.

**Abstract:** With the advent of advancements in deep learning approaches, such as deep convolution neural network, residual neural network, adversarial network; U-Net architectures are most widely utilized in biomedical image segmentation to address the automation in identification and detection of the target regions or sub-regions. In recent studies, U-Net based approaches have illustrated state-of-the-art performance in different applications for the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems for early diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as brain tumor, lung cancer, alzheimer, breast cancer, etc., using various modalities. This article contributes in presenting the success of these approaches by describing the U-Net framework, followed by the comprehensive analysis of the U-Net variants by performing 1) inter-modality, and 2) intra-modality categorization to establish better insights into the associated challenges and solutions. Besides, this article also highlights the contribution of U-Net based frameworks in the ongoing pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as COVID-19.

**Abstract:** This paper is a review of a particular approach to the method of maximum entropy as a general framework for inference. The discussion emphasizes the pragmatic elements in the derivation. An epistemic notion of information is defined in terms of its relation to the Bayesian beliefs of ideally rational agents. The method of updating from a prior to a posterior probability distribution is designed through an eliminative induction process. The logarithmic relative entropy is singled out as the unique tool for updating that (a) is of universal applicability; (b) that recognizes the value of prior information; and (c) that recognizes the privileged role played by the notion of independence in science. The resulting framework -- the ME method -- can handle arbitrary priors and arbitrary constraints. It includes MaxEnt and Bayes' rule as special cases and, therefore, it unifies entropic and Bayesian methods into a single general inference scheme. The ME method goes beyond the mere selection of a single posterior, but also addresses the question of how much less probable other distributions might be, which provides a direct bridge to the theories of fluctuations and large deviations.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models often encounter distribution shifts when deployed in the real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution shift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is continually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without observing the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of true label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables the reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning. Informed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by classical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online Gradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify our findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and show that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging label shift scenarios.

**Abstract:** Annotating user interfaces (UIs) that involves localization and classification of meaningful UI elements on a screen is a critical step for many mobile applications such as screen readers and voice control of devices. Annotating object icons, such as menu, search, and arrow backward, is especially challenging due to the lack of explicit labels on screens, their similarity to pictures, and their diverse shapes. Existing studies either use view hierarchy or pixel based methods to tackle the task. Pixel based approaches are more popular as view hierarchy features on mobile platforms are often incomplete or inaccurate, however it leaves out instructional information in the view hierarchy such as resource-ids or content descriptions. We propose a novel deep learning based multi-modal approach that combines the benefits of both pixel and view hierarchy features as well as leverages the state-of-the-art object detection techniques. In order to demonstrate the utility provided, we create a high quality UI dataset by manually annotating the most commonly used 29 icons in Rico, a large scale mobile design dataset consisting of 72k UI screenshots. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our multi-modal approach. Our model not only outperforms a widely used object classification baseline but also pixel based object detection models. Our study sheds light on how to combine view hierarchy with pixel features for annotating UI elements.

**Abstract:** Image registration aims to establish spatial correspondence across pairs, or groups of images, and is a cornerstone of medical image computing and computer-assisted-interventions. Currently, most deep learning-based registration methods assume that the desired deformation fields are globally smooth and continuous, which is not always valid for real-world scenarios, especially in medical image registration (e.g. cardiac imaging and abdominal imaging). Such a global constraint can lead to artefacts and increased errors at discontinuous tissue interfaces. To tackle this issue, we propose a weakly-supervised Deep Discontinuity-preserving Image Registration network (DDIR), to obtain better registration performance and realistic deformation fields. We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in registration accuracy and predicts more realistic deformations, in registration experiments on cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images from UK Biobank Imaging Study (UKBB), than state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the problem of evaluating the addition of elements to a set. This problem is difficult, because it can, in the general case, not be reduced to unconditional preferences between the choices. Therefore, we model preferences based on the context of the decision. We discuss and compare two different Siamese network architectures for this task: a twin network that compares the two sets resulting after the addition, and a triplet network that models the contribution of each candidate to the existing set. We evaluate the two settings on a real-world task; learning human card preferences for deck building in the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering. We show that the triplet approach achieves a better result than the twin network and that both outperform previous results on this task.

**Abstract:** Given the increasing threat of adversarial attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), research on efficient detection methods is more important than ever. In this work, we take a closer look at adversarial attack detection based on the class scores of an already trained classification model. We propose to train a support vector machine (SVM) on the class scores to detect adversarial examples. Our method is able to detect adversarial examples generated by various attacks, and can be easily adopted to a plethora of deep classification models. We show that our approach yields an improved detection rate compared to an existing method, whilst being easy to implement. We perform an extensive empirical analysis on different deep classification models, investigating various state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Moreover, we observe that our proposed method is better at detecting a combination of adversarial attacks. This work indicates the potential of detecting various adversarial attacks simply by using the class scores of an already trained classification model.

**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a large number of parameters requires huge computational resources, which has limited the application of CNNs on resources constrained appliances. Decomposition-based methods, therefore, have been utilized to compress CNNs in recent years. However, since the compression factor and performance are negatively correlated, the state-of-the-art works either suffer from severe performance degradation or have limited low compression factors. To overcome these problems, unlike previous works compressing layers separately, we propose to compress CNNs and alleviate performance degradation via joint matrix decomposition. The idea is inspired by the fact that there are lots of repeated modules in CNNs, and by projecting weights with the same structures into the same subspace, networks can be further compressed and even accelerated. In particular, three joint matrix decomposition schemes are developed, and the corresponding optimization approaches based on Singular Values Decomposition are proposed. Extensive experiments are conducted across three challenging compact CNNs and 3 benchmark data sets to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms. As a result, our methods can compress the size of ResNet-34 by 22x with slighter accuracy degradation compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** This paper seeks to tackle the bin packing problem (BPP) through a learning perspective. Building on self-attention-based encoding and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, we propose a new end-to-end learning model for this task of interest. By decomposing the combinatorial action space, as well as utilizing a new training technique denoted as prioritized oversampling, which is a general scheme to speed up on-policy learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in a range of experimental settings. Moreover, although the proposed approach attend2pack targets offline-BPP, we strip our method down to the strict online-BPP setting where it is also able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. With a set of ablation studies as well as comparisons against a range of previous works, we hope to offer as a valid baseline approach to this field of study.

**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation models only perform well on the domain they are trained on and datasets for training are scarce and often have a small label-spaces, because the pixel level annotations required are expensive to make. Thus training models on multiple existing domains is desired to increase the output label-space. Current research shows that there is potential to improve accuracy across datasets by using multi-domain training, but this has not yet been successfully extended to datasets of three different non-overlapping domains without manual labelling. In this paper a method for this is proposed for the datasets Cityscapes, SUIM and SUN RGB-D, by creating a label-space that spans all classes of the datasets. Duplicate classes are merged and discrepant granularity is solved by keeping classes separate. Results show that accuracy of the multi-domain model has higher accuracy than all baseline models together, if hardware performance is equalized, as resources are not limitless, showing that models benefit from additional data even from domains that have nothing in common.

**Abstract:** This paper analyses the fundamental ingredients behind surrogate explanations to provide a better understanding of their inner workings. We start our exposition by considering global surrogates, describing the trade-off between complexity of the surrogate and fidelity to the black-box being modelled. We show that transitioning from global to local - reducing coverage - allows for more favourable conditions on the Pareto frontier of fidelity-complexity of a surrogate. We discuss the interplay between complexity, fidelity and coverage, and consider how different user needs can lead to problem formulations where these are either constraints or penalties. We also present experiments that demonstrate how the local surrogate interpretability procedure can be made interactive and lead to better explanations.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks often suffer from poor performance or even training failure due to the ill-conditioned problem, the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, and the saddle point problem. In this paper, a novel method by acting the gradient activation function (GAF) on the gradient is proposed to handle these challenges. Intuitively, the GAF enlarges the tiny gradients and restricts the large gradient. Theoretically, this paper gives conditions that the GAF needs to meet, and on this basis, proves that the GAF alleviates the problems mentioned above. In addition, this paper proves that the convergence rate of SGD with the GAF is faster than that without the GAF under some assumptions. Furthermore, experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and PASCAL visual object classes confirm the GAF's effectiveness. The experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed method is able to be adopted in various deep neural networks to improve their performance.

**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial samples, the detection of which is crucial for the wide application of these DNN models. Recently, a number of deep testing methods in software engineering were proposed to find the vulnerability of DNN systems, and one of them, i.e., Model Mutation Testing (MMT), was used to successfully detect various adversarial samples generated by different kinds of adversarial attacks. However, the mutated models in MMT are always huge in number (e.g., over 100 models) and lack diversity (e.g., can be easily circumvented by high-confidence adversarial samples), which makes it less efficient in real applications and less effective in detecting high-confidence adversarial samples. In this study, we propose Graph-Guided Testing (GGT) for adversarial sample detection to overcome these aforementioned challenges. GGT generates pruned models with the guide of graph characteristics, each of them has only about 5% parameters of the mutated model in MMT, and graph guided models have higher diversity. The experiments on CIFAR10 and SVHN validate that GGT performs much better than MMT with respect to both effectiveness and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Despite the groundbreaking successes of neural networks, contemporary models require extensive training with massive datasets and exhibit poor out-of-sample generalization. One proposed solution is to build systematicity and domain-specific constraints into the model, echoing the tenets of classical, symbolic cognitive architectures. In this paper, we consider the limitations of this approach by examining human adults' ability to learn an abstract reasoning task from a brief instructional tutorial and explanatory feedback for incorrect responses, demonstrating that human learning dynamics and ability to generalize outside the range of the training examples differ drastically from those of a representative neural network model, and that the model is brittle to changes in features not anticipated by its authors. We present further evidence from human data that the ability to consistently solve the puzzles was associated with education, particularly basic mathematics education, and with the ability to provide a reliably identifiable, valid description of the strategy used. We propose that rapid learning and systematic generalization in humans may depend on a gradual, experience-dependent process of learning-to-learn using instructions and explanations to guide the construction of explicit abstract rules that support generalizable inferences.

**Abstract:** Graph convolutional networks are becoming indispensable for deep learning from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which only work as low-pass filters.

**Abstract:** Counterfactual explanations are viewed as an effective way to explain machine learning predictions. This interest is reflected by a relatively young literature with already dozens of algorithms aiming to generate such explanations. These algorithms are focused on finding how features can be modified to change the output classification. However, this rather general objective can be achieved in different ways, which brings about the need for a methodology to test and benchmark these algorithms. The contributions of this work are manifold: First, a large benchmarking study of 10 algorithmic approaches on 22 tabular datasets is performed, using 9 relevant evaluation metrics. Second, the introduction of a novel, first of its kind, framework to test counterfactual generation algorithms. Third, a set of objective metrics to evaluate and compare counterfactual results. And finally, insight from the benchmarking results that indicate which approaches obtain the best performance on what type of dataset. This benchmarking study and framework can help practitioners in determining which technique and building blocks most suit their context, and can help researchers in the design and evaluation of current and future counterfactual generation algorithms. Our findings show that, overall, there's no single best algorithm to generate counterfactual explanations as the performance highly depends on properties related to the dataset, model, score and factual point specificities.

<p>

**Abstract:** Training and using modern neural-network based latent-variable generative models (like Variational Autoencoders) often require simultaneously training a generative direction along with an inferential(encoding) direction, which approximates the posterior distribution over the latent variables. Thus, the question arises: how complex does the inferential model need to be, in order to be able to accurately model the posterior distribution of a given generative model?
  In this paper, we identify an important property of the generative map impacting the required size of the encoder. We show that if the generative map is "strongly invertible" (in a sense we suitably formalize), the inferential model need not be much more complex. Conversely, we prove that there exist non-invertible generative maps, for which the encoding direction needs to be exponentially larger (under standard assumptions in computational complexity). Importantly, we do not require the generative model to be layerwise invertible, which a lot of the related literature assumes and isn't satisfied by many architectures used in practice (e.g. convolution and pooling based networks). Thus, we provide theoretical support for the empirical wisdom that learning deep generative models is harder when data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.

**Abstract:** Dense depth estimation and 3D reconstruction of a surgical scene are crucial steps in computer assisted surgery. Recent work has shown that depth estimation from a stereo images pair could be solved with convolutional neural networks. However, most recent depth estimation models were trained on datasets with per-pixel ground truth. Such data is especially rare for laparoscopic imaging, making it hard to apply supervised depth estimation to real surgical applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose SADepth, a new self-supervised depth estimation method based on Generative Adversarial Networks. It consists of an encoder-decoder generator and a discriminator to incorporate geometry constraints during training. Multi-scale outputs from the generator help to solve the local minima caused by the photometric reprojection loss, while the adversarial learning improves the framework generation quality. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that SADepth outperforms recent state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin, and reduces the gap between supervised and unsupervised depth estimation in laparoscopic images.

**Abstract:** Many modern machine learning applications come with complex and nuanced design goals such as minimizing the worst-case error, satisfying a given precision or recall target, or enforcing group-fairness constraints. Popular techniques for optimizing such non-decomposable objectives reduce the problem into a sequence of cost-sensitive learning tasks, each of which is then solved by re-weighting the training loss with example-specific costs. We point out that the standard approach of re-weighting the loss to incorporate label costs can produce unsatisfactory results when used to train over-parameterized models. As a remedy, we propose new cost-sensitive losses that extend the classical idea of logit adjustment to handle more general cost matrices. Our losses are calibrated, and can be further improved with distilled labels from a teacher model. Through experiments on benchmark image datasets, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in training ResNet models with common robust and constrained optimization objectives.

**Abstract:** The success of reinforcement learning in typical settings is, in part, predicated on underlying Markovian assumptions on the reward signal by which an agent learns optimal policies. In recent years, the use of reward machines has relaxed this assumption by enabling a structured representation of non-Markovian rewards. In particular, such representations can be used to augment the state space of the underlying decision process, thereby facilitating non-Markovian reinforcement learning. However, these reward machines cannot capture the semantics of stochastic reward signals. In this paper, we make progress on this front by introducing probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) as a representation of non-Markovian stochastic rewards. We present an algorithm to learn PRMs from the underlying decision process as well as to learn the PRM representation of a given decision-making policy.

**Abstract:** Our evolution as a species made a huge step forward when we understood the relationships between causes and effects. These associations may be trivial for some events, but they are not in complex scenarios. To rigorously prove that some occurrences are caused by others, causal theory and causal inference were formalized, introducing the $do$-operator and its associated rules. The main goal of this report is to review and implement in Python some algorithms to compute conditional and non-conditional causal queries from observational data. To this end, we first present some basic background knowledge on probability and graph theory, before introducing important results on causal theory, used in the construction of the algorithms. We then thoroughly study the identification algorithms presented by Shpitser and Pearl in 2006, explaining our implementation in Python alongside. The main identification algorithm can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of $do$-calculus, and it eventually either returns an expression for the causal query from experimental probabilities or fails to identify the causal effect, in which case the effect is non-identifiable. We introduce our newly developed Python library and give some usage examples.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces Redescription Model Mining, a novel approach to identify interpretable patterns across two datasets that share only a subset of attributes and have no common instances. In particular, Redescription Model Mining aims to find pairs of describable data subsets -- one for each dataset -- that induce similar exceptional models with respect to a prespecified model class. To achieve this, we combine two previously separate research areas: Exceptional Model Mining and Redescription Mining. For this new problem setting, we develop interestingness measures to select promising patterns, propose efficient algorithms, and demonstrate their potential on synthetic and real-world data. Uncovered patterns can hint at common underlying phenomena that manifest themselves across datasets, enabling the discovery of possible associations between (combinations of) attributes that do not appear in the same dataset.

**Abstract:** Consider an ensemble of $k$ individual classifiers whose accuracies are known. Upon receiving a test point, each of the classifiers outputs a predicted label and a confidence in its prediction for this particular test point. In this paper, we address the question of whether we can determine the accuracy of the ensemble. Surprisingly, even when classifiers are combined in the statistically optimal way in this setting, the accuracy of the resulting ensemble classifier cannot be computed from the accuracies of the individual classifiers-as would be the case in the standard setting of confidence weighted majority voting. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the ensemble accuracy. We explicitly construct the individual classifiers that attain the upper and lower bounds: specialists and generalists. Our theoretical results have very practical consequences: (1) If we use ensemble methods and have the choice to construct our individual (independent) classifiers from scratch, then we should aim for specialist classifiers rather than generalists. (2) Our bounds can be used to determine how many classifiers are at least required to achieve a desired ensemble accuracy. Finally, we improve our bounds by considering the mutual information between the true label and the individual classifier's output.

**Abstract:** Ensembles of CNN models trained with different seeds (also known as Deep Ensembles) are known to achieve superior performance over a single copy of the CNN. Neural Ensemble Search (NES) can further boost performance by adding architectural diversity. However, the scope of NES remains prohibitive under limited computational resources. In this work, we extend NES to multi-headed ensembles, which consist of a shared backbone attached to multiple prediction heads. Unlike Deep Ensembles, these multi-headed ensembles can be trained end to end, which enables us to leverage one-shot NAS methods to optimize an ensemble objective. With extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that multi-headed ensemble search finds robust ensembles 3 times faster, while having comparable performance to other ensemble search methods, in both predictive performance and uncertainty calibration.

**Abstract:** Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a prevalent imaging technique for retina. However, it is affected by multiplicative speckle noise that can degrade the visibility of essential anatomical structures, including blood vessels and tissue layers. Although averaging repeated B-scan frames can significantly improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), this requires longer acquisition time, which can introduce motion artifacts and cause discomfort to patients. In this study, we propose a learning-based method that exploits information from the single-frame noisy B-scan and a pseudo-modality that is created with the aid of the self-fusion method. The pseudo-modality provides good SNR for layers that are barely perceptible in the noisy B-scan but can over-smooth fine features such as small vessels. By using a fusion network, desired features from each modality can be combined, and the weight of their contribution is adjustable. Evaluated by intensity-based and structural metrics, the result shows that our method can effectively suppress the speckle noise and enhance the contrast between retina layers while the overall structure and small blood vessels are preserved. Compared to the single modality network, our method improves the structural similarity with low noise B-scan from 0.559 +\- 0.033 to 0.576 +\- 0.031.

**Abstract:** Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used for ophthalmology. It can be extended to OCT angiography (OCT-A), which reveals the retinal vasculature with improved contrast. Recent deep learning algorithms produced promising vascular segmentation results; however, 3D retinal vessel segmentation remains difficult due to the lack of manually annotated training data. We propose a learning-based method that is only supervised by a self-synthesized modality named local intensity fusion (LIF). LIF is a capillary-enhanced volume computed directly from the input OCT-A. We then construct the local intensity fusion encoder (LIFE) to map a given OCT-A volume and its LIF counterpart to a shared latent space. The latent space of LIFE has the same dimensions as the input data and it contains features common to both modalities. By binarizing this latent space, we obtain a volumetric vessel segmentation. Our method is evaluated in a human fovea OCT-A and three zebrafish OCT-A volumes with manual labels. It yields a Dice score of 0.7736 on human data and 0.8594 +/- 0.0275 on zebrafish data, a dramatic improvement over existing unsupervised algorithms.

**Abstract:** Previously, we established a lung sound database, HF_Lung_V2 and proposed convolutional bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) models with adequate ability for inhalation, exhalation, continuous adventitious sound (CAS), and discontinuous adventitious sound detection in the lung sound. In this study, we proceeded to build a tracheal sound database, HF_Tracheal_V1, containing 11107 of 15-second tracheal sound recordings, 23087 inhalation labels, 16728 exhalation labels, and 6874 CAS labels. The tracheal sound in HF_Tracheal_V1 and the lung sound in HF_Lung_V2 were either combined or used alone to train the CNN-BiGRU models for respective lung and tracheal sound analysis. Different training strategies were investigated and compared: (1) using full training (training from scratch) to train the lung sound models using lung sound alone and train the tracheal sound models using tracheal sound alone, (2) using a mixed set that contains both the lung and tracheal sound to train the models, and (3) using domain adaptation that finetuned the pre-trained lung sound models with the tracheal sound data and vice versa. Results showed that the models trained only by lung sound performed poorly in the tracheal sound analysis and vice versa. However, the mixed set training and domain adaptation can improve the performance of exhalation and CAS detection in the lung sound, and inhalation, exhalation, and CAS detection in the tracheal sound compared to positive controls (lung models trained only by lung sound and vice versa). Especially, a model derived from the mixed set training prevails in the situation of killing two birds with one stone.

**Abstract:** We previously established a large lung sound database, HF_Lung_V2 (Lung_V2). We trained convolutional-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) networks for detecting inhalation, exhalation, continuous adventitious sound (CAS) and discontinuous adventitious sound at the recording level on the basis of Lung_V2. However, the performance of CAS detection was poor due to many reasons, one of which is the highly diversified CAS patterns. To make the original CNN-BiGRU model learn the CAS patterns more effectively and not cause too much computing burden, three strategies involving minimal modifications of the network architecture of the CNN layers were investigated: (1) making the CNN layers a bit deeper by using the residual blocks, (2) making the CNN layers a bit wider by increasing the number of CNN kernels, and (3) separating the feature input into multiple paths (the model was denoted by Multi-path CNN-BiGRU). The performance of CAS segment and event detection were evaluated. Results showed that improvement in CAS detection was observed among all the proposed architecture-modified models. The F1 score for CAS event detection of the proposed models increased from 0.445 to 0.491-0.530, which was deemed significant. However, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model outperformed the other models in terms of the number of winning titles (five) in total nine evaluation metrics. In addition, the Multi-path CNN-BiGRU model did not cause extra computing burden (0.97-fold inference time) compared to the original CNN-BiGRU model. Conclusively, the Multi-path CNN layers can efficiently improve the effectiveness of feature extraction and subsequently result in better CAS detection.

**Abstract:** Relatively abundant availability of medical imaging data has provided significant support in the development and testing of Neural Network based image processing methods. Clinicians often face issues in selecting suitable image processing algorithm for medical imaging data. A strategy for the selection of a proper model is presented here. The training data set comprises optical coherence tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice eyes with more than 100 days follow-up. The data contains images from treated and untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are tested for automatic (a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b) segmentation of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of deep learning models is performed with respect to the number of training and testing images using 8 eight performance indices to study accuracy, reliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign tumor data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with Inception backbone for benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and root mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found most and least sensitive performance indices, respectively. The performance (via indices) is found to be exponentially improving regarding a number of training images. The segmented OCT-Angiography data shows that neovascularization drives the tumor volume. Image analysis shows that photodynamic imaging-assisted tumor treatment protocol is transforming an aggressively growing tumor into a cyst. An empirical expression is obtained to help medical professionals to choose a particular model given the number of images and types of characteristics. We recommend that the presented exercise should be taken as standard practice before employing a particular deep learning model for biomedical image analysis.

**Abstract:** Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that results in rigidity, tremors and postural instability. There is no definite medical test to diagnose PD and diagnosis is mostly a clinical exercise. Although guidelines exist, about 10-30% of the patients are wrongly diagnosed with PD. Hence, there is a need for an accurate, unbiased and fast method for diagnosis. In this study, we propose LPGNet, a fast and accurate method to diagnose PD from gait. LPGNet uses Linear Prediction Residuals (LPR) to extract discriminating patterns from gait recordings and then uses a 1D convolution neural network with depth-wise separable convolutions to perform diagnosis. LPGNet achieves an AUC of 0.91 with a 21 times speedup and about 99% lesser parameters in the model compared to the state of the art. We also undertake an analysis of various cross-validation strategies used in literature in PD diagnosis from gait and find that most methods are affected by some form of data leakage between various folds which leads to unnecessarily large models and inflated performance due to overfitting. The analysis clears the path for future works in correctly evaluating their methods.

**Abstract:** Micro-Doppler signatures contain considerable information about target dynamics. However, the radar sensing systems are easily affected by noisy surroundings, resulting in uninterpretable motion patterns on the micro-Doppler spectrogram. Meanwhile, radar returns often suffer from multipath, clutter and interference. These issues lead to difficulty in, for example motion feature extraction, activity classification using micro Doppler signatures ($Î¼$-DS), etc. In this paper, we propose a latent feature-wise mapping strategy, called Feature Mapping Network (FMNet), to transform measured spectrograms so that they more closely resemble the output from a simulation under the same conditions. Based on measured spectrogram and the matched simulated data, our framework contains three parts: an Encoder which is used to extract latent representations/features, a Decoder outputs reconstructed spectrogram according to the latent features, and a Discriminator minimizes the distance of latent features of measured and simulated data. We demonstrate the FMNet with six activities data and two experimental scenarios, and final results show strong enhanced patterns and can keep actual motion information to the greatest extent. On the other hand, we also propose a novel idea which trains a classifier with only simulated data and predicts new measured samples after cleaning them up with the FMNet. From final classification results, we can see significant improvements.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel method called the Reinforced Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (RHGA) for solving the famous NP-hard Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Specifically, we combine a reinforcement learning technique with the well-known Edge Assembly Crossover genetic algorithm (EAX-GA) and the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) local search heuristic. With the help of the proposed hybrid mechanism, the genetic evolution of EAX-GA and the local search of LKH can boost each other's performance. And the reinforcement learning technique based on Q-learning further promotes the hybrid genetic algorithm. Experimental results on 138 well-known and widely used TSP benchmarks with the number of cities ranging from 1,000 to 85,900 demonstrate the excellent performance of RHGA, that outperforms EAX-GA and LKH significantly.

**Abstract:** Starting from childhood, the human brain restructures and rewires throughout life. Characterizing such complex brain development requires effective analysis of longitudinal and multi-modal neuroimaging data. Here, we propose such an analysis approach named Longitudinal Correlation Analysis (LCA). LCA couples the data of two modalities by first reducing the input from each modality to a latent representation based on autoencoders. A self-supervised strategy then relates the two latent spaces by jointly disentangling two directions, one in each space, such that the longitudinal changes in latent representations along those directions are maximally correlated between modalities. We applied LCA to analyze the longitudinal T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRIs of 679 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence. Unlike existing approaches that focus on either cross-sectional or single-modal modeling, LCA successfully unraveled coupled macrostructural and microstructural brain development from morphological and diffusivity features extracted from the data. A retesting of LCA on raw 3D image volumes of those subjects successfully replicated the findings from the feature-based analysis. Lastly, the developmental effects revealed by LCA were inline with the current understanding of maturational patterns of the adolescent brain.

**Abstract:** Atmospheric correction is a fundamental task in remote sensing because observations are taken either of the atmosphere or looking through the atmosphere. Atmospheric correction errors can significantly alter the spectral signature of the observations, and lead to invalid classifications or target detection. This is even more crucial when working with hyperspectral data, where a precise measurement of spectral properties is required. State-of-the-art physics-based atmospheric correction approaches require extensive prior knowledge about sensor characteristics, collection geometry, and environmental characteristics of the scene being collected. These approaches are computationally expensive, prone to inaccuracy due to lack of sufficient environmental and collection information, and often impossible for real-time applications. In this paper, a geometry-dependent hybrid neural network is proposed for automatic atmospheric correction using multi-scan hyperspectral data collected from different geometries. The proposed network can characterize the atmosphere without any additional meteorological data. A grid-search method is also proposed to solve the temperature emissivity separation problem. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to accurately characterize the atmosphere and estimate target emissivity spectra with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under 0.02 for 29 different materials. This solution can lead to accurate atmospheric correction to improve target detection for real time applications.

**Abstract:** Video-quality measurement plays a critical role in the development of video-processing applications. In this paper, we show how video preprocessing can artificially increase the popular quality metric VMAF and its tuning-resistant version, VMAF NEG. We propose a pipeline that tunes processing-algorithm parameters to increase VMAF by up to 218.8%. A subjective comparison revealed that for most preprocessing methods, a video's visual quality drops or stays unchanged. We also show that some preprocessing methods can increase VMAF NEG scores by up to 23.6%.

**Abstract:** Author name ambiguity remains a critical open problem in digital libraries due to synonymy and homonymy of names. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to link author names to their real-world entities by relying on their co-authorship pattern and area of research. Our supervised deep learning model identifies an author by capturing his/her relationship with his/her co-authors and area of research, which is represented by the titles and sources of the target author's publications. These attributes are encoded by their semantic and symbolic representations. To this end, Bib2Auth uses ~ 22K bibliographic records from the DBLP repository and is trained with each pair of co-authors. The extensive experiments have proved the capability of the approach to distinguish between authors sharing the same name and recognize authors with different name variations. Bib2Auth has shown good performance on a relatively large dataset, which qualifies it to be directly integrated into bibliographic indices.

**Abstract:** Automatic segmentation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) videos can assist radiologists in efficient diagnosis of HCC and accurate evaluation of tumors in clinical practice. Few studies have investigated HCC segmentation from DSA videos. It shows great challenging due to motion artifacts in filming, ambiguous boundaries of tumor regions and high similarity in imaging to other anatomical tissues. In this paper, we raise the problem of HCC segmentation in DSA videos, and build our own DSA dataset. We also propose a novel segmentation network called DSA-LTDNet, including a segmentation sub-network, a temporal difference learning (TDL) module and a liver region segmentation (LRS) sub-network for providing additional guidance. DSA-LTDNet is preferable for learning the latent motion information from DSA videos proactively and boosting segmentation performance. All of experiments are conducted on our self-collected dataset. Experimental results show that DSA-LTDNet increases the DICE score by nearly 4% compared to the U-Net baseline.

**Abstract:** Applying Federated Learning (FL) on Internet-of-Things devices is necessitated by the large volumes of data they produce and growing concerns of data privacy. However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to make FL efficient: (i) execute on devices with limited computational capabilities, (ii) account for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity of devices, and (iii) adapt to the changing network bandwidths. This paper presents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in computationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep neural networks (DNNs) to servers. Further, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement learning-based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers of the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to tackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network bandwidth. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed comprising five IoT devices. By offloading a DNN from the device to the server FedAdapt reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half compared to classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall training time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network bandwidth, FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40% when compared to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy.

**Abstract:** The combination of Winograd's algorithm and systolic array architecture has demonstrated the capability of improving DSP efficiency in accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on FPGA platforms. However, handling arbitrary convolution kernel sizes in FPGA-based Winograd processing elements and supporting efficient data access remain underexplored. In this work, we are the first to propose an optimized Winograd processing element (WinoPE), which can naturally support multiple convolution kernel sizes with the same amount of computing resources and maintains high runtime DSP efficiency. Using the proposed WinoPE, we construct a highly efficient systolic array accelerator, termed WinoCNN. We also propose a dedicated memory subsystem to optimize the data access. Based on the accelerator architecture, we build accurate resource and performance modeling to explore optimal accelerator configurations under different resource constraints. We implement our proposed accelerator on multiple FPGAs, which outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in terms of both throughput and DSP efficiency. Our implementation achieves DSP efficiency up to 1.33 GOPS/DSP and throughput up to 3.1 TOPS with the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. These are 29.1\% and 20.0\% better than the best solutions reported previously, respectively.

**Abstract:** The burgeoning field of "algorithmic fairness" provides a novel set of methods for reasoning about the fairness of algorithmic predictions and decisions. Yet even as algorithmic fairness has become a prominent component of efforts to enhance equality in domains such public policy, it also faces significant limitations and critiques. The most fundamental issue is the mathematical result known as the "impossibility of fairness" (an incompatibility between mathematical definitions of fairness). Furthermore, many algorithms that satisfy standards of fairness actually exacerbate oppression. These two issues call into question whether algorithmic fairness can play a productive role in the pursuit of equality. In this paper, I diagnose these issues as the product of algorithmic fairness methodology and propose an alternative path forward for the field. The dominant approach of "formal algorithmic fairness" suffers from a fundamental limitation: it relies on a narrow frame of analysis that is limited to specific decision-making processes, in isolation from the context of those decisions. In light of this shortcoming, I draw on theories of substantive equality from law and philosophy to propose an alternative method: "substantive algorithmic fairness." Substantive algorithmic fairness takes a more expansive scope to analyzing fairness, looking beyond specific decision points to account for social hierarchies and the impacts of decisions facilitated by algorithms. As a result, substantive algorithmic fairness suggests reforms that combat oppression and that provide an escape from the impossibility of fairness. Moreover, substantive algorithmic fairness presents a new direction for the field of algorithmic fairness: away from formal mathematical models of "fairness" and towards substantive evaluations of how algorithms can (and cannot) promote equality.

**Abstract:** Multiplex immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry benefit patients by allowing cancer pathologists to identify several proteins expressed on the surface of cells, enabling cell classification, better understanding of the tumour micro-environment, more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and tailored immunotherapy based on the immune status of individual patients. However, they are expensive and time consuming processes which require complex staining and imaging techniques by expert technicians. Hoechst staining is much cheaper and easier to perform, but is not typically used in this case as it binds to DNA rather than to the proteins targeted by immunofluorescent techniques, and it was not previously thought possible to differentiate cells expressing these proteins based only on DNA morphology. In this work we show otherwise, training a deep convolutional neural network to identify cells expressing three proteins (T lymphocyte markers CD3 and CD8, and the B lymphocyte marker CD20) with greater than 90% precision and recall, from Hoechst 33342 stained tissue only. Our model learns previously unknown morphological features associated with expression of these proteins which can be used to accurately differentiate lymphocyte subtypes for use in key prognostic metrics such as assessment of immune cell infiltration,and thereby predict and improve patient outcomes without the need for costly multiplex immunofluorescence.

**Abstract:** We show that differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) can yield poorly calibrated, overconfident deep learning models. This represents a serious issue for safety-critical applications, e.g. in medical diagnosis. We highlight and exploit parallels between stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, a scalable Bayesian inference technique for training deep neural networks, and DP-SGD, in order to train differentially private, Bayesian neural networks with minor adjustments to the original (DP-SGD) algorithm. Our approach provides considerably more reliable uncertainty estimates than DP-SGD, as demonstrated empirically by a reduction in expected calibration error (MNIST $\sim{5}$-fold, Pediatric Pneumonia Dataset $\sim{2}$-fold).

**Abstract:** We propose a method for the blind separation of sounds of musical instruments in audio signals. We describe the individual tones via a parametric model, training a dictionary to capture the relative amplitudes of the harmonics. The model parameters are predicted via a U-Net, which is a type of deep neural network. The network is trained without ground truth information, based on the difference between the model prediction and the individual time frames of the short-time Fourier transform. Since some of the model parameters do not yield a useful backpropagation gradient, we model them stochastically and employ the policy gradient instead. To provide phase information and account for inaccuracies in the dictionary-based representation, we also let the network output a direct prediction, which we then use to resynthesize the audio signals for the individual instruments. Due to the flexibility of the neural network, inharmonicity can be incorporated seamlessly and no preprocessing of the input spectra is required. Our algorithm yields high-quality separation results with particularly low interference on a variety of different audio samples, both acoustic and synthetic, provided that the sample contains enough data for the training and that the spectral characteristics of the musical instruments are sufficiently stable to be approximated by the dictionary.
