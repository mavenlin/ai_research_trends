**Abstract:** The remarkable practical success of deep learning has revealed some major surprises from a theoretical perspective. In particular, simple gradient methods easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems, and despite giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit effort to control model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive accuracy. We conjecture that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that overparametrization allows gradient methods to find interpolating solutions, that these methods implicitly impose regularization, and that overparametrization leads to benign overfitting. We survey recent theoretical progress that provides examples illustrating these principles in simpler settings. We first review classical uniform convergence results and why they fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep learning methods. We give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient methods lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data. Then we review prediction methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on regression problems with quadratic loss. For these methods, we can decompose the prediction rule into a simple component that is useful for prediction and a spiky component that is useful for overfitting but, in a favorable setting, does not harm prediction accuracy. We focus specifically on the linear regime for neural networks, where the network can be approximated by a linear model. In this regime, we demonstrate the success of gradient flow, and we consider benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving an exact asymptotic analysis that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization. We conclude by highlighting the key challenges that arise in extending these insights to realistic deep learning settings.

**Abstract:** Recently, Frankle & Carbin (2019) demonstrated that randomly-initialized dense networks contain subnetworks that once found can be trained to reach test accuracy comparable to the trained dense network. However, finding these high performing trainable subnetworks is expensive, requiring iterative process of training and pruning weights. In this paper, we propose (and prove) a stronger Multi-Prize Lottery Ticket Hypothesis:
  A sufficiently over-parameterized neural network with random weights contains several subnetworks (winning tickets) that (a) have comparable accuracy to a dense target network with learned weights (prize 1), (b) do not require any further training to achieve prize 1 (prize 2), and (c) is robust to extreme forms of quantization (i.e., binary weights and/or activation) (prize 3).
  This provides a new paradigm for learning compact yet highly accurate binary neural networks simply by pruning and quantizing randomly weighted full precision neural networks. We also propose an algorithm for finding multi-prize tickets (MPTs) and test it by performing a series of experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Empirical results indicate that as models grow deeper and wider, multi-prize tickets start to reach similar (and sometimes even higher) test accuracy compared to their significantly larger and full-precision counterparts that have been weight-trained. Without ever updating the weight values, our MPTs-1/32 not only set new binary weight network state-of-the-art (SOTA) Top-1 accuracy -- 94.8% on CIFAR-10 and 74.03% on ImageNet -- but also outperform their full-precision counterparts by 1.78% and 0.76%, respectively. Further, our MPT-1/1 achieves SOTA Top-1 accuracy (91.9%) for binary neural networks on CIFAR-10. Code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/chrundle/biprop.

**Abstract:** While deep learning has enabled great advances in many areas of music, labeled music datasets remain especially hard, expensive, and time-consuming to create. In this work, we introduce SimCLR to the music domain and contribute a large chain of audio data augmentations to form a simple framework for self-supervised, contrastive learning of musical representations: CLMR. This approach works on raw time-domain music data and requires no labels to learn useful representations. We evaluate CLMR in the downstream task of music classification on the MagnaTagATune and Million Song datasets and present an ablation study to test which of our music-related innovations over SimCLR are most effective. A linear classifier trained on the proposed representations achieves a higher average precision than supervised models on the MagnaTagATune dataset, and performs comparably on the Million Song dataset. Moreover, we show that CLMR's representations are transferable using out-of-domain datasets, indicating that our method has strong generalisability in music classification. Lastly, we show that the proposed method allows data-efficient learning on smaller labeled datasets: we achieve an average precision of 33.1% despite using only 259 labeled songs in the MagnaTagATune dataset (1% of the full dataset) during linear evaluation. To foster reproducibility and future research on self-supervised learning in music, we publicly release the pre-trained models and the source code of all experiments of this paper.

**Abstract:** An implicit but pervasive hypothesis of modern computer vision research is that convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that perform better on ImageNet will also perform better on other vision datasets. We challenge this hypothesis through an extensive empirical study for which we train 500 sampled CNN architectures on ImageNet as well as 8 other image classification datasets from a wide array of application domains. The relationship between architecture and performance varies wildly, depending on the datasets. For some of them, the performance correlation with ImageNet is even negative. Clearly, it is not enough to optimize architectures solely for ImageNet when aiming for progress that is relevant for all applications. Therefore, we identify two dataset-specific performance indicators: the cumulative width across layers as well as the total depth of the network. Lastly, we show that the range of dataset variability covered by ImageNet can be significantly extended by adding ImageNet subsets restricted to few classes.

**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have revolutionized computer vision and are often advocated as good models of the human visual system. However, there are currently many shortcomings of DCNNs, which preclude them as a model of human vision. For example, in the case of adversarial attacks, where adding small amounts of noise to an image, including an object, can lead to strong misclassification of that object. But for humans, the noise is often invisible. If vulnerability to adversarial noise cannot be fixed, DCNNs cannot be taken as serious models of human vision. Many studies have tried to add features of the human visual system to DCNNs to make them robust against adversarial attacks. However, it is not fully clear whether human vision inspired components increase robustness because performance evaluations of these novel components in DCNNs are often inconclusive. We propose a set of criteria for proper evaluation and analyze different models according to these criteria. We finally sketch future efforts to make DCCNs one step closer to the model of human vision.

**Abstract:** This work empirically demonstrates the ability of Text Graph Convolutional Network (Text GCN) to outperform traditional natural language processing benchmarks for the task of semi-supervised Swahili news classification. In particular, we focus our experimentation on the sparsely-labelled semi-supervised context which is representative of the practical constraints facing low-resourced African languages. We follow up on this result by introducing a variant of the Text GCN model which utilises a bag of words embedding rather than a naive one-hot encoding to reduce the memory footprint of Text GCN whilst demonstrating similar predictive performance.

**Abstract:** 3D point cloud segmentation is an important function that helps robots understand the layout of their surrounding environment and perform tasks such as grasping objects, avoiding obstacles, and finding landmarks. Current segmentation methods are mostly class-specific, many of which are tuned to work with specific object categories and may not be generalizable to different types of scenes. This research proposes a learnable region growing method for class-agnostic point cloud segmentation, specifically for the task of instance label prediction. The proposed method is able to segment any class of objects using a single deep neural network without any assumptions about their shapes and sizes. The deep neural network is trained to predict how to add or remove points from a point cloud region to morph it into incrementally more complete regions of an object instance. Segmentation results on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show that the proposed method outperforms competing methods by 1%-9% on 6 different evaluation metrics.

**Abstract:** Social recommendation is effective in improving the recommendation performance by leveraging social relations from online social networking platforms. Social relations among users provide friends' information for modeling users' interest in candidate items and help items expose to potential consumers (i.e., item attraction). However, there are two issues haven't been well-studied: Firstly, for the user interests, existing methods typically aggregate friends' information contextualized on the candidate item only, and this shallow context-aware aggregation makes them suffer from the limited friends' information. Secondly, for the item attraction, if the item's past consumers are the friends of or have a similar consumption habit to the targeted user, the item may be more attractive to the targeted user, but most existing methods neglect the relation enhanced context-aware item attraction. To address the above issues, we proposed DICER (Dual Side Deep Context-aware Modulation for SocialRecommendation). Specifically, we first proposed a novel graph neural network to model the social relation and collaborative relation, and on top of high-order relations, a dual side deep context-aware modulation is introduced to capture the friends' information and item attraction. Empirical results on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model and further experiments are conducted to help understand how the dual context-aware modulation works.

**Abstract:** How to improve generative modeling by better exploiting spatial regularities and coherence in images? We introduce a novel neural network for building image generators (decoders) and apply it to variational autoencoders (VAEs). In our spatial dependency networks (SDNs), feature maps at each level of a deep neural net are computed in a spatially coherent way, using a sequential gating-based mechanism that distributes contextual information across 2-D space. We show that augmenting the decoder of a hierarchical VAE by spatial dependency layers considerably improves density estimation over baseline convolutional architectures and the state-of-the-art among the models within the same class. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN can be applied to large images by synthesizing samples of high quality and coherence. In a vanilla VAE setting, we find that a powerful SDN decoder also improves learning disentangled representations, indicating that neural architectures play an important role in this task. Our results suggest favoring spatial dependency over convolutional layers in various VAE settings. The accompanying source code is given at https://github.com/djordjemila/sdn.

**Abstract:** Training deep neural networks on large datasets containing high-dimensional data requires a large amount of computation. A solution to this problem is data-parallel distributed training, where a model is replicated into several computational nodes that have access to different chunks of the data. This approach, however, entails high communication rates and latency because of the computed gradients that need to be shared among nodes at every iteration. The problem becomes more pronounced in the case that there is wireless communication between the nodes (i.e. due to the limited network bandwidth). To address this problem, various compression methods have been proposed including sparsification, quantization, and entropy encoding of the gradients. Existing methods leverage the intra-node information redundancy, that is, they compress gradients at each node independently. In contrast, we advocate that the gradients across the nodes are correlated and propose methods to leverage this inter-node redundancy to improve compression efficiency. Depending on the node communication protocol (parameter server or ring-allreduce), we propose two instances of the LGC approach that we coin Learned Gradient Compression (LGC). Our methods exploit an autoencoder (i.e. trained during the first stages of the distributed training) to capture the common information that exists in the gradients of the distributed nodes. We have tested our LGC methods on the image classification and semantic segmentation tasks using different convolutional neural networks (ResNet50, ResNet101, PSPNet) and multiple datasets (ImageNet, Cifar10, CamVid). The ResNet101 model trained for image classification on Cifar10 achieved an accuracy of 93.57%, which is lower than the baseline distributed training with uncompressed gradients only by 0.18%.

**Abstract:** For a globally recognized planting breeding organization, manually-recorded field observation data is crucial for plant breeding decision making. However, certain phenotypic traits such as plant color, height, kernel counts, etc. can only be collected during a specific time-window of a crop's growth cycle. Due to labor-intensive requirements, only a small subset of possible field observations are recorded each season. To help mitigate this data collection bottleneck in wheat breeding, we propose a novel deep learning framework to accurately and efficiently count wheat heads to aid in the gathering of real-time data for decision making. We call our model WheatNet and show that our approach is robust and accurate for a wide range of environmental conditions of the wheat field. WheatNet uses a truncated MobileNetV2 as a lightweight backbone feature extractor which merges feature maps with different scales to counter image scale variations. Then, extracted multi-scale features go to two parallel sub-networks for simultaneous density-based counting and localization tasks. Our proposed method achieves an MAE and RMSE of 3.85 and 5.19 in our wheat head counting task, respectively, while having significantly fewer parameters when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method.

**Abstract:** With the advent of smart devices that support 4K and 8K resolution, Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) has become an important computer vision problem. However, most super resolution deep networks are computationally very expensive. In this paper, we propose Super-Efficient Super Resolution (SESR) networks that establish a new state-of-the-art for efficient super resolution. Our approach is based on linear overparameterization of CNNs and creates an efficient model architecture for SISR. With theoretical analysis, we uncover the limitations of existing overparameterization methods and show how the proposed method alleviates them. Detailed experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SESR achieves similar or better image quality than state-of-the-art models while requiring 2x to 330x fewer Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. As a result, SESR can be used on constrained hardware to perform x2 (1080p to 4K) and x4 (1080p to 8K) SISR. Towards this, we simulate hardware performance numbers for a commercial mobile Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for 1080p to 4K (x2) and 1080p to 8K (x4) SISR. Our results highlight the challenges faced by super resolution on AI accelerators and demonstrate that SESR is significantly faster (e.g., 6x-8x higher FPS) than existing models on mobile-NPUs. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/ARM-software/sesr.

**Abstract:** In this study, we report the successful execution of in-air knotting of rope using a dual-arm two-finger robot based on deep learning. Owing to its flexibility, the state of the rope was in constant flux during the operation of the robot. This required the robot control system to dynamically correspond to the state of the object at all times. However, a manual description of appropriate robot motions corresponding to all object states is difficult to be prepared in advance. To resolve this issue, we constructed a model that instructed the robot to perform bowknots and overhand knots based on two deep neural networks trained using the data gathered from its sensorimotor, including visual and proximity sensors. The resultant model was verified to be capable of predicting the appropriate robot motions based on the sensory information available online. In addition, we designed certain task motions based on the Ian knot method using the dual-arm two-fingers robot. The designed knotting motions do not require a dedicated workbench or robot hand, thereby enhancing the versatility of the proposed method. Finally, experiments were performed to estimate the knotting performance of the real robot while executing overhand knots and bowknots on rope and its success rate. The experimental results established the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel framework of program and invariant synthesis called neural network-guided synthesis. We first show that, by suitably designing and training neural networks, we can extract logical formulas over integers from the weights and biases of the trained neural networks. Based on the idea, we have implemented a tool to synthesize formulas from positive/negative examples and implication constraints, and obtained promising experimental results. We also discuss two applications of our synthesis method. One is the use of our tool for qualifier discovery in the framework of ICE-learning-based CHC solving, which can in turn be applied to program verification and inductive invariant synthesis. Another application is to a new program development framework called oracle-based programming, which is a neural-network-guided variation of Solar-Lezama's program synthesis by sketching.

**Abstract:** This work is an update of a previous paper on the same topic published a few years ago. With the dramatic progress in generative modeling, a suite of new quantitative and qualitative techniques to evaluate models has emerged. Although some measures such as Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, Precision-Recall, and Perceptual Path Length are relatively more popular, GAN evaluation is not a settled issue and there is still room for improvement. Here, I describe new dimensions that are becoming important in assessing models (e.g. bias and fairness) and discuss the connection between GAN evaluation and deepfakes. These are important areas of concern in the machine learning community today and progress in GAN evaluation can help mitigate them.

**Abstract:** The ability to recognize human partners is an important social skill to build personalized and long-term human-robot interactions, especially in scenarios like education, care-giving, and rehabilitation. Faces and voices constitute two important sources of information to enable artificial systems to reliably recognize individuals. Deep learning networks have achieved state-of-the-art results and demonstrated to be suitable tools to address such a task. However, when those networks are applied to different and unprecedented scenarios not included in the training set, they can suffer a drop in performance. For example, with robotic platforms in ever-changing and realistic environments, where always new sensory evidence is acquired, the performance of those models degrades. One solution is to make robots learn from their first-hand sensory data with self-supervision. This allows coping with the inherent variability of the data gathered in realistic and interactive contexts. To this aim, we propose a cognitive architecture integrating low-level perceptual processes with a spatial working memory mechanism. The architecture autonomously organizes the robot's sensory experience into a structured dataset suitable for human recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture and show that it is a promising solution in the quest of making robots more autonomous in their learning process.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of reconstructing a perfect matching $M^*$ hidden in a randomly weighted $n\times n$ bipartite graph. The edge set includes every node pair in $M^*$ and each of the $n(n-1)$ node pairs not in $M^*$ independently with probability $d/n$. The weight of each edge $e$ is independently drawn from the distribution $\mathcal{P}$ if $e \in M^*$ and from $\mathcal{Q}$ if $e \notin M^*$. We show that if $\sqrt{d} B(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q}) \le 1$, where $B(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q})$ stands for the Bhattacharyya coefficient, the reconstruction error (average fraction of misclassified edges) of the maximum likelihood estimator of $M^*$ converges to $0$ as $n\to \infty$. Conversely, if $\sqrt{d} B(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{Q}) \ge 1+Îµ$ for an arbitrarily small constant $Îµ>0$, the reconstruction error for any estimator is shown to be bounded away from $0$ under both the sparse and dense model, resolving the conjecture in [Moharrami et al. 2019, Semerjian et al. 2020]. Furthermore, in the special case of complete exponentially weighted graph with $d=n$, $\mathcal{P}=\exp(Î»)$, and $\mathcal{Q}=\exp(1/n)$, for which the sharp threshold simplifies to $Î»=4$, we prove that when $Î»\le 4-Îµ$, the optimal reconstruction error is $\exp\left( - Î(1/\sqrtÎµ) \right)$, confirming the conjectured infinite-order phase transition in [Semerjian et al. 2020].

**Abstract:** There are demographic biases in current models used for facial recognition (FR). Our Balanced Faces In the Wild (BFW) dataset serves as a proxy to measure bias across ethnicity and gender subgroups, allowing one to characterize FR performances per subgroup. We show performances are non-optimal when a single score threshold is used to determine whether sample pairs are genuine or imposter. Across subgroups, performance ratings vary from the reported across the entire dataset. Thus, claims of specific error rates only hold true for populations matching that of the validation data. We mitigate the imbalanced performances using a novel domain adaptation learning scheme on the facial features extracted using state-of-the-art. Not only does this technique balance performance, but it also boosts the overall performance. A benefit of the proposed is to preserve identity information in facial features while removing demographic knowledge in the lower dimensional features. The removal of demographic knowledge prevents future potential biases from being injected into decision-making. This removal satisfies privacy concerns. We explore why this works qualitatively; we also show quantitatively that subgroup classifiers can no longer learn from the features mapped by the proposed.

**Abstract:** Using the spatial structure of various indoor environments as prior knowledge, the robot would construct the map more efficiently. Autonomous mobile robots generally apply simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods to understand the reachable area in newly visited environments. However, conventional mapping approaches are limited by only considering sensor observation and control signals to estimate the current environment map. This paper proposes a novel SLAM method, map completion network-based SLAM (MCN-SLAM), based on a probabilistic generative model incorporating deep neural networks for map completion. These map completion networks are primarily trained in the framework of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to extract the global structure of large amounts of existing map data. We show in experiments that the proposed method can estimate the environment map 1.3 times better than the previous SLAM methods in the situation of partial observation.

**Abstract:** Landing a quadrotor on an inclined surface is a challenging manoeuvre. The final state of any inclined landing trajectory is not an equilibrium, which precludes the use of most conventional control methods. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to design an autonomous landing controller for inclined surfaces. Using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with sparse rewards and a tailored curriculum learning approach, a robust policy can be trained in simulation in less than 90 minutes on a standard laptop. The policy then directly runs on a real Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor and successfully performs real inclined landings in a flying arena. A single policy evaluation takes approximately 2.5 ms, which makes it suitable for a future embedded implementation on the quadrotor.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of an online advertising system that wants to optimally spend an advertiser's given budget for a campaign across multiple platforms, without knowing the value for showing an ad to the users on those platforms. We model this challenging practical application as a Stochastic Bandits with Knapsacks problem over $T$ rounds of bidding with the set of arms given by the set of distinct bidding $m$-tuples, where $m$ is the number of platforms. We modify the algorithm proposed in Badanidiyuru \emph{et al.,} to extend it to the case of multiple platforms to obtain an algorithm for both the discrete and continuous bid-spaces. Namely, for discrete bid spaces we give an algorithm with regret $O\left(OPT \sqrt {\frac{mn}{B} }+ \sqrt{mn OPT}\right)$, where $OPT$ is the performance of the optimal algorithm that knows the distributions. For continuous bid spaces the regret of our algorithm is $\tilde{O}\left(m^{1/3} \cdot \min\left\{ B^{2/3}, (m T)^{2/3} \right\} \right)$. When restricted to this special-case, this bound improves over Sankararaman and Slivkins in the regime $OPT \ll T$, as is the case in the particular application at hand. Second, we show an $ Î©\left (\sqrt {m OPT} \right)$ lower bound for the discrete case and an $Î©\left( m^{1/3} B^{2/3}\right)$ lower bound for the continuous setting, almost matching the upper bounds. Finally, we use a real-world data set from a large internet online advertising company with multiple ad platforms and show that our algorithms outperform common benchmarks and satisfy the required properties warranted in the real-world application.

**Abstract:** We propose HyperDynamics, a dynamics meta-learning framework that conditions on an agent's interactions with the environment and optionally its visual observations, and generates the parameters of neural dynamics models based on inferred properties of the dynamical system. Physical and visual properties of the environment that are not part of the low-dimensional state yet affect its temporal dynamics are inferred from the interaction history and visual observations, and are implicitly captured in the generated parameters. We test HyperDynamics on a set of object pushing and locomotion tasks. It outperforms existing dynamics models in the literature that adapt to environment variations by learning dynamics over high dimensional visual observations, capturing the interactions of the agent in recurrent state representations, or using gradient-based meta-optimization. We also show our method matches the performance of an ensemble of separately trained experts, while also being able to generalize well to unseen environment variations at test time. We attribute its good performance to the multiplicative interactions between the inferred system properties -- captured in the generated parameters -- and the low-dimensional state representation of the dynamical system.

**Abstract:** Surgical instrument segmentation for robot-assisted surgery is needed for accurate instrument tracking and augmented reality overlays. Therefore, the topic has been the subject of a number of recent papers in the CAI community. Deep learning-based methods have shown state-of-the-art performance for surgical instrument segmentation, but their results depend on labelled data. However, labelled surgical data is of limited availability and is a bottleneck in surgical translation of these methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the limited generalizability of these methods on different datasets, including human robot-assisted surgeries. We then propose a novel joint generation and segmentation strategy to learn a segmentation model with better generalization capability to domains that have no labelled data. The method leverages the availability of labelled data in a different domain. The generator does the domain translation from the labelled domain to the unlabelled domain and simultaneously, the segmentation model learns using the generated data while regularizing the generative model. We compared our method with state-of-the-art methods and showed its generalizability on publicly available datasets and on our own recorded video frames from robot-assisted prostatectomies. Our method shows consistently high mean Dice scores on both labelled and unlabelled domains when data is available only for one of the domains.

**Abstract:** Emotional expressions are the behaviors that communicate our emotional state or attitude to others. They are expressed through verbal and non-verbal communication. Complex human behavior can be understood by studying physical features from multiple modalities; mainly facial, vocal and physical gestures. Recently, spontaneous multi-modal emotion recognition has been extensively studied for human behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning-based approach for audio-visual emotion recognition. Our approach leverages recent advances in deep learning like knowledge distillation and high-performing deep architectures. The deep feature representations of the audio and visual modalities are fused based on a model-level fusion strategy. A recurrent neural network is then used to capture the temporal dynamics. Our proposed approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in predicting valence on the RECOLA dataset. Moreover, our proposed visual facial expression feature extraction network outperforms state-of-the-art results on the AffectNet and Google Facial Expression Comparison datasets.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose to address the issue of sample efficiency, in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), with a semi-supervised training strategy that combines Hebbian learning with gradient descent: all internal layers (both convolutional and fully connected) are pre-trained using an unsupervised approach based on Hebbian learning, and the last fully connected layer (the classification layer) is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). In fact, as Hebbian learning is an unsupervised learning method, its potential lies in the possibility of training the internal layers of a DCNN without labels. Only the final fully connected layer has to be trained with labeled examples.
  We performed experiments on various object recognition datasets, in different regimes of sample efficiency, comparing our semi-supervised (Hebbian for internal layers + SGD for the final fully connected layer) approach with end-to-end supervised backprop training, and with semi-supervised learning based on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). The results show that, in regimes where the number of available labeled samples is low, our semi-supervised approach outperforms the other approaches in almost all the cases.

**Abstract:** Use of Deep Learning (DL) in commercial applications such as image classification, sentiment analysis and speech recognition is increasing. When training DL models with large number of parameters and/or large datasets, cost and speed of training can become prohibitive. Distributed DL training solutions that split a training job into subtasks and execute them over multiple nodes can decrease training time. However, the cost of current solutions, built predominantly for cluster computing systems, can still be an issue. In contrast to cluster computing systems, Volunteer Computing (VC) systems can lower the cost of computing, but applications running on VC systems have to handle fault tolerance, variable network latency and heterogeneity of compute nodes, and the current solutions are not designed to do so. We design a distributed solution that can run DL training on a VC system by using a data parallel approach. We implement a novel asynchronous SGD scheme called VC-ASGD suited for VC systems. In contrast to traditional VC systems that lower cost by using untrustworthy volunteer devices, we lower cost by leveraging preemptible computing instances on commercial cloud platforms. By using preemptible instances that require applications to be fault tolerant, we lower cost by 70-90% and improve data security.

**Abstract:** The success of state-of-the-art machine learning is essentially all based on different variations of gradient descent algorithms that minimize some version of a cost or loss function. A fundamental limitation, however, is the need to train these systems in either supervised or unsupervised ways by exposing them to typically large numbers of training examples. Here, we introduce a fundamentally novel conceptual approach to machine learning that takes advantage of a neurobiologically derived model of dynamic signaling, constrained by the geometric structure of a network. We show that MNIST images can be uniquely encoded and classified by the dynamics of geometric networks with nearly state-of-the-art accuracy in an unsupervised way, and without the need for any training.

**Abstract:** Conventional face super-resolution methods usually assume testing low-resolution (LR) images lie in the same domain as the training ones. Due to different lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between training and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios. Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR) performance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain efficiently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem, we develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network, named DAP-FSR network. Our DAP-FSR is the first attempt to super-resolve LR faces from a target domain by exploiting only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR exemplar in the target domain. To be specific, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its encoder to extract the multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face. Considering only one target domain example is available, we propose to augment the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target domain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representations to the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images resembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces. Extensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superior performance of our DAP-FSR compared to the state-of-the-art.

**Abstract:** Simulation environments are good for learning different driving tasks like lane changing, parking or handling intersections etc. in an abstract manner. However, these simulation environments often restrict themselves to operate under conservative interaction behavior amongst different vehicles. But, as we know, real driving tasks often involve very high risk scenarios where other drivers often don't behave in the expected sense. There can be many reasons for this behavior like being tired or inexperienced. The simulation environment doesn't take this information into account while training the navigation agent. Therefore, in this study we especially focus on systematically creating these risk prone scenarios with heavy traffic and unexpected random behavior for creating better model-free learning agents. We generate multiple autonomous driving scenarios by creating new custom Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment iterations in the highway-env simulation package. The behavior policy is learnt by agents trained with the help from deep reinforcement learning models. Our behavior policy is deliberated to handle collisions and risky randomized driver behavior. We train model free learning agents with supplement information of risk prone driving scenarios and compare their performance with baseline agents. Finally, we casually measure the impact of adding these perturbations in the training process to precisely account for the performance improvement obtained from utilizing the learnings from these scenarios.

**Abstract:** Outlier ensemble methods have shown outstanding performance on the discovery of instances that are significantly different from the majority of the data. However, without the awareness of fairness, their applicability in the ethical scenarios, such as fraud detection and judiciary judgement system, could be degraded. In this paper, we propose to reduce the bias of the outlier ensemble results through a fairness-aware ensemble framework. Due to the lack of ground truth in the outlier detection task, the key challenge is how to mitigate the degradation in the detection performance with the improvement of fairness. To address this challenge, we define a distance measure based on the output of conventional outlier ensemble techniques to estimate the possible cost associated with detection performance degradation. Meanwhile, we propose a post-processing framework to tune the original ensemble results through a stacking process so that we can achieve a trade off between fairness and detection performance. Detection performance is measured by the area under ROC curve (AUC) while fairness is measured at both group and individual level. Experiments on eight public datasets are conducted. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving fairness of outlier ensemble results. We also analyze the trade-off between AUC and fairness.

<p>

**Abstract:** Prices generated by automated price experimentation algorithms often display wild fluctuations, leading to unfavorable customer perceptions and violations of individual fairness: e.g., the price seen by a customer can be significantly higher than what was seen by her predecessors, only to fall once again later. To address this concern, we propose demand learning under a monotonicity constraint on the sequence of prices, within the framework of stochastic convex optimization with bandit feedback.
  Our main contribution is the design of the first sublinear-regret algorithms for monotonic price experimentation for smooth and strongly concave revenue functions under noisy as well as noiseless bandit feedback. The monotonicity constraint presents a unique challenge: since any increase (or decrease) in the decision-levels is final, an algorithm needs to be cautious in its exploration to avoid over-shooting the optimum. At the same time, minimizing regret requires that progress be made towards the optimum at a sufficient pace. Balancing these two goals is particularly challenging under noisy feedback, where obtaining sufficiently accurate gradient estimates is expensive. Our key innovation is to utilize conservative gradient estimates to adaptively tailor the degree of caution to local gradient information, being aggressive far from the optimum and being increasingly cautious as the prices approach the optimum. Importantly, we show that our algorithms guarantee the same regret rates (up to logarithmic factors) as the best achievable rates of regret without the monotonicity requirement.

**Abstract:** Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a popular method for few-shot learning but assumes that we have access to the meta-training set. In practice, training on the meta-training set may not always be an option due to data privacy concerns, intellectual property issues, or merely lack of computing resources. In this paper, we consider the novel problem of repurposing pretrained MAML checkpoints to solve new few-shot classification tasks. Because of the potential distribution mismatch, the original MAML steps may no longer be optimal. Therefore we propose an alternative meta-testing procedure and combine MAML gradient steps with adversarial training and uncertainty-based stepsize adaptation. Our method outperforms "vanilla" MAML on same-domain and cross-domains benchmarks using both SGD and Adam optimizers and shows improved robustness to the choice of base stepsize.

**Abstract:** Tree-based models are among the most efficient machine learning techniques for data mining nowadays due to their accuracy, interpretability, and simplicity. The recent orthogonal needs for more data and privacy protection call for collaborative privacy-preserving solutions. In this work, we survey the literature on distributed and privacy-preserving training of tree-based models and we systematize its knowledge based on four axes: the learning algorithm, the collaborative model, the protection mechanism, and the threat model. We use this to identify the strengths and limitations of these works and provide for the first time a framework analyzing the information leakage occurring in distributed tree-based model learning.

**Abstract:** Multiple lines of evidence suggest that predictive models may benefit from algorithmic triage. Under algorithmic triage, a predictive model does not predict all instances but instead defers some of them to human experts. However, the interplay between the prediction accuracy of the model and the human experts under algorithmic triage is not well understood. In this work, we start by formally characterizing under which circumstances a predictive model may benefit from algorithmic triage. In doing so, we also demonstrate that models trained for full automation may be suboptimal under triage. Then, given any model and desired level of triage, we show that the optimal triage policy is a deterministic threshold rule in which triage decisions are derived deterministically by thresholding the difference between the model and human errors on a per-instance level. Building upon these results, we introduce a practical gradient-based algorithm that is guaranteed to find a sequence of triage policies and predictive models of increasing performance. Experiments on a wide variety of supervised learning tasks using synthetic and real data from two important applications -- content moderation and scientific discovery -- illustrate our theoretical results and show that the models and triage policies provided by our gradient-based algorithm outperform those provided by several competitive baselines.

**Abstract:** The similarity among samples and the discrepancy between clusters are two crucial aspects of image clustering. However, current deep clustering methods suffer from the inaccurate estimation of either feature similarity or semantic discrepancy. In this paper, we present a Semantic Pseudo-labeling-based Image ClustEring (SPICE) framework, which divides the clustering network into a feature model for measuring the instance-level similarity and a clustering head for identifying the cluster-level discrepancy. We design two semantics-aware pseudo-labeling algorithms, prototype pseudo-labeling, and reliable pseudo-labeling, which enable accurate and reliable self-supervision over clustering. Without using any ground-truth label, we optimize the clustering network in three stages: 1) train the feature model through contrastive learning to measure the instance similarity, 2) train the clustering head with the prototype pseudo-labeling algorithm to identify cluster semantics, and 3) jointly train the feature model and clustering head with the reliable pseudo-labeling algorithm to improve the clustering performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPICE achieves significant improvements (~10%) over existing methods and establishes the new state-of-the-art clustering results on six image benchmark datasets in terms of three popular metrics. Importantly, SPICE significantly reduces the gap between unsupervised and fully-supervised classification; e.g., there is only a 2% (91.8% vs 93.8%) accuracy difference on CIFAR-10. Our code has been made publically available at https://github.com/niuchuangnn/SPICE.

**Abstract:** Deploying Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in the real-world require that the agents satisfy safety constraints. Current RL agents explore the environment without considering these constraints, which can lead to damage to the hardware or even other agents in the environment. We propose a new method, LBPO, that uses a Lyapunov-based barrier function to restrict the policy update to a safe set for each training iteration. Our method also allows the user to control the conservativeness of the agent with respect to the constraints in the environment. LBPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the number of constraint violations during training while being competitive in terms of performance. Further, our analysis reveals that baselines like CPO and SDDPG rely mostly on backtracking to ensure safety rather than safe projection, which provides insight into why previous methods might not have effectively limit the number of constraint violations.

**Abstract:** The field of autonomous robotics is growing at a rapid rate. The trend to use increasingly more sensors in vehicles is driven both by legislation and consumer demands for higher safety and reliable service. Nowadays, robots are found everywhere, ranging from homes, hospitals to industries, and military operations. Autonomous robots are developed to be robust enough to work beside humans and to carry out jobs efficiently. Humans have a natural sense of understanding of the physical forces acting around them like gravity, sense of motion, etc. which are not taught explicitly but are developed naturally. However, this is not the case with robots. To make the robot fully autonomous and competent to work with humans, the robot must be able to perceive the situation and devise a plan for smooth operation, considering all the adversities that may occur while carrying out the tasks. In this thesis, we present an autonomous mobile robot platform that delivers the package within the VNIT campus without any human intercommunication. From an initial user-supplied geographic target location, the system plans an optimized path and autonomously navigates through it. The entire pipeline of an autonomous robot working in outdoor environments is explained in detail in this thesis.

**Abstract:** Recently, deep neural networks are widely applied in recommender systems for their effectiveness in capturing/modeling users' preferences. Especially, the attention mechanism in deep learning enables recommender systems to incorporate various features in an adaptive way. Specifically, as for the next item recommendation task, we have the following three observations: 1) users' sequential behavior records aggregate at time positions ("time-aggregation"), 2) users have personalized taste that is related to the "time-aggregation" phenomenon ("personalized time-aggregation"), and 3) users' short-term interests play an important role in the next item prediction/recommendation. In this paper, we propose a new Time-aware Long- and Short-term Attention Network (TLSAN) to address those observations mentioned above. Specifically, TLSAN consists of two main components. Firstly, TLSAN models "personalized time-aggregation" and learn user-specific temporal taste via trainable personalized time position embeddings with category-aware correlations in long-term behaviors. Secondly, long- and short-term feature-wise attention layers are proposed to effectively capture users' long- and short-term preferences for accurate recommendation. Especially, the attention mechanism enables TLSAN to utilize users' preferences in an adaptive way, and its usage in long- and short-term layers enhances TLSAN's ability of dealing with sparse interaction data. Extensive experiments are conducted on Amazon datasets from different fields (also with different size), and the results show that TLSAN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both capturing users' preferences and performing time-sensitive next-item recommendation.

**Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) algorithms are optimized for the distribution represented by the training data. For outlier data, they often deliver predictions with equal confidence, even though these should not be trusted. In order to deploy ML-based digital pathology solutions in clinical practice, effective methods for detecting anomalous data are crucial to avoid incorrect decisions in the outlier scenario. We propose a new unsupervised learning approach for anomaly detection in histopathology data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Compared to the existing GAN-based methods that have been used in medical imaging, the proposed approach improves significantly on performance for pathology data. Our results indicate that histopathology imagery is substantially more complex than the data targeted by the previous methods. This complexity requires not only a more advanced GAN architecture but also an appropriate anomaly metric to capture the quality of the reconstructed images.

**Abstract:** Software repository hosting services contain large amounts of open-source software, with GitHub hosting more than 100 million repositories, from new to established ones. Given this vast amount of projects, there is a pressing need for a search based on the software's content and features. However, even though GitHub offers various solutions to aid software discovery, most repositories do not have any labels, reducing the utility of search and topic-based analysis. Moreover, classifying software modules is also getting more importance given the increase in Component-Based Software Development. However, previous work focused on software classification using keyword-based approaches or proxies for the project (e.g., README), which is not always available. In this work, we create a new annotated dataset of GitHub Java projects called LabelGit. Our dataset uses direct information from the source code, like the dependency graph and source code neural representations from the identifiers. Using this dataset, we hope to aid the development of solutions that do not rely on proxies but use the entire source code to perform classification.

<p>

**Abstract:** There is growing interest in data-driven weather prediction (DDWP), for example using convolutional neural networks such as U-NETs that are trained on data from models or reanalysis. Here, we propose 3 components to integrate with commonly used DDWP models in order to improve their physical consistency and forecast accuracy. These components are 1) a deep spatial transformer added to the latent space of the U-NETs to preserve a property called equivariance, which is related to correctly capturing rotations and scalings of features in spatio-temporal data, 2) a data-assimilation (DA) algorithm to ingest noisy observations and improve the initial conditions for next forecasts, and 3) a multi-time-step algorithm, which combines forecasts from DDWP models with different time steps through DA, improving the accuracy of forecasts at short intervals. To show the benefit/feasibility of each component, we use geopotential height at 500~hPa (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis and examine the short-term forecast accuracy of specific setups of the DDWP framework. Results show that the equivariance-preserving networks (U-STNs) clearly outperform the U-NETs, for example improving the forecast skill by $45\%$. Using a sigma-point ensemble Kalman (SPEnKF) algorithm for DA and U-STN as the forward model, we show that stable, accurate DA cycles are achieved even with high observation noise. The DDWP+DA framework substantially benefits from large ($O(1000)$) ensembles that are inexpensively generated with the data-driven forward model in each DA cycle. The multi-time-step DDWP+DA framework also shows promises, e.g., it reduces the average error by factors of 2-3.

**Abstract:** Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. However, early diagnosis dramatically increases the chances of survival, for which it is crucial to identify the tumor in the body. Since its imaging uses high-resolution techniques, annotating the tumor is time-consuming and requires particular expertise. Lately, methods built upon Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) have proven to be at par, if not better in many biomedical segmentation tasks. For the task at hand, we propose another CNN-based approach, which uses atrous convolutions and residual connections besides the conventional filters. The training and inference were made using an efficient patch-based approach, which significantly reduced unnecessary computations. The proposed AtResUNet was trained on the DigestPath 2019 Challenge dataset for colorectal cancer segmentation with results having a Dice Coefficient of 0.748.

**Abstract:** MRI is an inherently slow process, which leads to long scan time for high-resolution imaging. The speed of acquisition can be increased by ignoring parts of the data (undersampling). Consequently, this leads to the degradation of image quality, such as loss of resolution or introduction of image artefacts. This work aims to reconstruct highly undersampled Cartesian or radial MR acquisitions, with better resolution and with less to no artefact compared to conventional techniques like compressed sensing. In recent times, deep learning has emerged as a very important area of research and has shown immense potential in solving inverse problems, e.g. MR image reconstruction. In this paper, a deep learning based MR image reconstruction framework is proposed, which includes a modified regularised version of ResNet as the network backbone to remove artefacts from the undersampled image, followed by data consistency steps that fusions the network output with the data already available from undersampled k-space in order to further improve reconstruction quality. The performance of this framework for various undersampling patterns has also been tested, and it has been observed that the framework is robust to deal with various sampling patterns, even when mixed together while training, and results in very high quality reconstruction, in terms of high SSIM (highest being 0.990$\pm$0.006 for acceleration factor of 3.5), while being compared with the fully sampled reconstruction. It has been shown that the proposed framework can successfully reconstruct even for an acceleration factor of 20 for Cartesian (0.968$\pm$0.005) and 17 for radially (0.962$\pm$0.012) sampled data. Furthermore, it has been shown that the framework preserves brain pathology during reconstruction while being trained on healthy subjects.

**Abstract:** The goal of unsupervised anomaly segmentation (UAS) is to detect the pixel-level anomalies unseen during training. It is a promising field in the medical imaging community, e.g, we can use the model trained with only healthy data to segment the lesions of rare diseases. Existing methods are mainly based on Information Bottleneck, whose underlying principle is modeling the distribution of normal anatomy via learning to compress and recover the healthy data with a low-dimensional manifold, and then detecting lesions as the outlier from this learned distribution. However, this dimensionality reduction inevitably damages the localization information, which is especially essential for pixel-level anomaly detection. In this paper, to alleviate this issue, we introduce the semantic space of healthy anatomy in the process of modeling healthy-data distribution. More precisely, we view the couple of segmentation and synthesis as a special Autoencoder, and propose a novel cycle translation framework with a journey of 'image->semantic->image'. Experimental results on the BraTS and ISLES databases show that the proposed approach achieves significantly superior performance compared to several prior methods and segments the anomalies more accurately.

**Abstract:** Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) i.e. Residual Networks (ResNets) have been used successfully for many computer vision tasks, but are difficult to scale to 3D volumetric medical data. Memory is increasingly often the bottleneck when training 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Recently, invertible neural networks have been applied to significantly reduce activation memory footprint when training neural networks with backpropagation thanks to the invertible functions that allow retrieving its input from its output without storing intermediate activations in memory to perform the backpropagation.
  Among many successful network architectures, 3D Unet has been established as a standard architecture for volumetric medical segmentation. Thus, we choose 3D Unet as a baseline for a non-invertible network and we then extend it with the invertible residual network. In this paper, we proposed two versions of the invertible Residual Network, namely Partially Invertible Residual Network (Partially-InvRes) and Fully Invertible Residual Network (Fully-InvRes). In Partially-InvRes, the invertible residual layer is defined by a technique called additive coupling whereas in Fully-InvRes, both invertible upsampling and downsampling operations are learned based on squeezing (known as pixel shuffle). Furthermore, to avoid the overfitting problem because of less training data, a variational auto-encoder (VAE) branch is added to reconstruct the input volumetric data itself. Our results indicate that by using partially/fully invertible networks as the central workhorse in volumetric segmentation, we not only reduce memory overhead but also achieve compatible segmentation performance compared against the non-invertible 3D Unet. We have demonstrated the proposed networks on various volumetric datasets such as iSeg 2019 and BraTS 2020.

**Abstract:** Industrial robots can solve very complex tasks in controlled environments, but modern applications require robots able to operate in unpredictable surroundings as well. An increasingly popular reactive policy architecture in robotics is Behavior Trees but as with other architectures, programming time still drives cost and limits flexibility. There are two main branches of algorithms to generate policies automatically, automated planning and machine learning, both with their own drawbacks. We propose a method for generating Behavior Trees using a Genetic Programming algorithm and combining the two branches by taking the result of an automated planner and inserting it into the population. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method of combining planning and learning performs well on a variety of robotic assembly problems and outperforms both of the base methods used separately. We also show that this type of high level learning of Behavior Trees can be transferred to a real system without further training.

**Abstract:** The fault diagnostic model trained for a laboratory case machine fails to perform well on the industrial machines running under variable operating conditions. For every new operating condition of such machines, a new diagnostic model has to be trained which is a time-consuming and uneconomical process. Therefore, we propose a quick learning mechanism that can transform the existing diagnostic model into a new model suitable for industrial machines operating in different conditions. The proposed method uses the Net2Net transformation followed by a fine-tuning to cancel/minimize the maximum mean discrepancy between the new data and the previous one. The fine-tuning of the model requires a very less amount of labelled target samples and very few iterations of training. Therefore, the proposed method is capable of learning the new target data pattern quickly. The effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method has been demonstrated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, Intelligent Maintenance Systems bearing dataset, and Paderborn university dataset under the wide variations of the operating conditions. It has been validated that the diagnostic model trained on artificially damaged fault datasets can be used to quickly train another model for a real damage dataset.

**Abstract:** We propose an unsupervised machine-learning checkpoint-restart (CR) lossy algorithm for particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms using Gaussian mixtures (GM). The algorithm features a particle compression stage and a particle reconstruction stage, where a continuum particle distribution function is constructed and resampled, respectively. To guarantee fidelity of the CR process, we ensure the exact preservation of charge, momentum, and energy for both compression and reconstruction stages, everywhere on the mesh. We also ensure the preservation of Gauss' law after particle reconstruction. As a result, the GM CR algorithm is shown to provide a clean, conservative restart capability while potentially affording orders of magnitude savings in input/output requirements. We demonstrate the algorithm using a recently developed exactly energy- and charge-conserving PIC algorithm on physical problems of interest, with compression factors $\gtrsim75$ with no appreciable impact on the quality of the restarted dynamics.

Leave-one-out cross-validation is used for estimating the performance of the predictive models. The output of this research is a software package well-suited to be retrained based on any measured near-field databank to automate the identification of magnetic-type or electric-type of the radiating coupling sources.

**Abstract:** In a cell-free wireless network, distributed access points (APs) jointly serve all user equipments (UEs) within the their coverage area by using the same time/frequency resources. In this paper, we develop a novel downlink cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) network architecture that enables all APs and UEs to dynamically self-partition into a set of independent cell-free subnetworks in a time-slot basis. For this, we propose several network partitioning algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, to mitigate interference between different cell-free subnetworks, we develop a novel hybrid analog beamsteering-digital beamforming model that zero-forces interference among cell-free subnetworks and at the same time maximizes the instantaneous sum-rate of all UEs within each subnetwork. Specifically, the hybrid beamforming model is implemented by using a novel mixed DRL-convex optimization method in which analog beamsteering between APs and UEs is conducted based on DRL while digital beamforming is modeled and solved as a convex optimization problem. The DRL models for network clustering and hybrid beamsteering are combined into a single hierarchical DRL design that enables exchange of DRL agents' experiences during both network training and operation. We also benchmark the performance of DRL models for clustering and beamsteering in terms of network performance, convergence rate, and computational complexity.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of optimizing a non-convex loss function (with saddle points) in a distributed framework in the presence of Byzantine machines. We consider a standard distributed setting with one central machine (parameter server) communicating with many worker machines. Our proposed algorithm is a variant of the celebrated cubic-regularized Newton method of Nesterov and Polyak \cite{nest}, which avoids saddle points efficiently and converges to local minima. Furthermore, our algorithm resists the presence of Byzantine machines, which may create \emph{fake local minima} near the saddle points of the loss function, also known as saddle-point attack. We robustify the cubic-regularized Newton algorithm such that it avoids the saddle points and the fake local minimas efficiently. Furthermore, being a second order algorithm, the iteration complexity is much lower than its first order counterparts, and thus our algorithm communicates little with the parameter server. We obtain theoretical guarantees for our proposed scheme under several settings including approximate (sub-sampled) gradients and Hessians. Moreover, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments using standard datasets and several types of Byzantine attacks.

**Abstract:** The network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as the access time, the bandwidth, and the packet loss play an important role in determining the Quality of Experience (QoE) of mobile applications. Various factors like the Radio Resource Control (RRC) states, the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) specific retransmission configurations, handovers triggered by the user mobility, the network load, etc. can cause high variability in these QoS metrics on 4G/LTE, and WiFi networks, which can be detrimental to the application QoE. Therefore, exposing the mobile application to realistic network QoS metrics is critical for a tester attempting to predict its QoE. A viable approach is testing using synthetic traces. The main challenge in the generation of realistic synthetic traces is the diversity of environments and the lack of wide scope of real traces to calibrate the generators. In this paper, we describe a measurement-driven methodology based on transfer learning with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural nets to solve this problem. The methodology requires a relatively short sample of the targeted environment to adapt the presented basic model to new environments, thus simplifying synthetic traces generation. We present this feature for realistic WiFi and LTE cloud access time models adapted for diverse target environments with a trace size of just 6000 samples measured over a few tens of minutes. We demonstrate that synthetic traces generated from these models are capable of accurately reproducing application QoE metric distributions including their outlier values.

**Abstract:** Security of inference phase deployment of Convolutional neural network (CNN) into resource constrained embedded systems (e.g. low end FPGAs) is a growing research area. Using secure practices, third party FPGA designers can be provided with no knowledge of initial and final classification layers. In this work, we demonstrate that hardware intrinsic attack (HIA) in such a "secure" design is still possible. Proposed HIA is inserted inside mathematical operations of individual layers of CNN, which propagates erroneous operations in all the subsequent CNN layers that lead to misclassification. The attack is non-periodic and completely random, hence it becomes difficult to detect. Five different attack scenarios with respect to each CNN layer are designed and evaluated based on the overhead resources and the rate of triggering in comparison to the original implementation. Our results for two CNN architectures show that in all the attack scenarios, additional latency is negligible (<0.61%), increment in DSP, LUT, FF is also less than 2.36%. Three attack scenarios do not require any additional BRAM resources, while in two scenarios BRAM increases, which compensates with the corresponding decrease in FF and LUTs. To the authors' best knowledge this work is the first to address the hardware intrinsic CNN attack with the attacker does not have knowledge of the full CNN.

**Abstract:** We present a unified technique for sequential estimation of convex divergences between distributions, including integral probability metrics like the kernel maximum mean discrepancy, $\varphi$-divergences like the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and optimal transport costs, such as powers of Wasserstein distances. This is achieved by observing that empirical convex divergences are (partially ordered) reverse submartingales with respect to the exchangeable filtration, coupled with maximal inequalities for such processes. These techniques appear to be complementary and powerful additions to the existing literature on both confidence sequences and convex divergences. We construct an offline-to-sequential device that converts a wide array of existing offline concentration inequalities into time-uniform confidence sequences that can be continuously monitored, providing valid tests or confidence intervals at arbitrary stopping times. The resulting sequential bounds pay only an iterated logarithmic price over the corresponding fixed-time bounds, retaining the same dependence on problem parameters (like dimension or alphabet size if applicable). These results are also applicable to more general convex functionals, like the negative differential entropy, suprema of empirical processes, and V-Statistics.

**Abstract:** Over the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of misinformation on the Internet, with online users constantly falling victims of fake news. A multitude of past studies have analyzed fake news diffusion mechanics and detection and mitigation techniques. However, there are still open questions about their operational behavior such as: How old are fake news websites? Do they typically stay online for long periods of time? Do such websites synchronize with each other their up and down time? Do they share similar content through time? Which third-parties support their operations? How much user traffic do they attract, in comparison to mainstream or real news websites? In this paper, we perform a first of its kind investigation to answer such questions regarding the online presence of fake news websites and characterize their behavior in comparison to real news websites. Based on our findings, we build a content-agnostic ML classifier for automatic detection of fake news websites (i.e. accuracy) that are not yet included in manually curated blacklists.

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement Learning for end-to-end driving is limited by the need of complex reward engineering. Sparse rewards can circumvent this challenge but suffers from long training time and leads to sub-optimal policy. In this work, we explore full-control driving with only goal-constrained sparse reward and propose a curriculum learning approach for end-to-end driving using only navigation view maps that benefit from small virtual-to-real domain gap. To address the complexity of multiple driving policies, we learn concurrent individual policies selected at inference by a navigation system. We demonstrate the ability of our proposal to generalize on unseen road layout, and to drive significantly longer than in the training.

**Abstract:** Many HPC applications suffer from a bottleneck in the shared caches, instruction execution units, I/O or memory bandwidth, even though the remaining resources may be underutilized. It is hard for developers and runtime systems to ensure that all critical resources are fully exploited by a single application, so an attractive technique for increasing HPC system utilization is to colocate multiple applications on the same server. When applications share critical resources, however, contention on shared resources may lead to reduced application performance.
  In this paper, we show that server efficiency can be improved by first modeling the expected performance degradation of colocated applications based on measured hardware performance counters, and then exploiting the model to determine an optimized mix of colocated applications. This paper presents a new intelligent resource manager and makes the following contributions: (1) a new machine learning model to predict the performance degradation of colocated applications based on hardware counters and (2) an intelligent scheduling scheme deployed on an existing resource manager to enable application co-scheduling with minimum performance degradation. Our results show that our approach achieves performance improvements of 7% (avg) and 12% (max) compared to the standard policy commonly used by existing job managers.

**Abstract:** Differentially private models seek to protect the privacy of data the model is trained on, making it an important component of model security and privacy. At the same time, data scientists and machine learning engineers seek to use uncertainty quantification methods to ensure models are as useful and actionable as possible. We explore the tension between uncertainty quantification via dropout and privacy by conducting membership inference attacks against models with and without differential privacy. We find that models with large dropout slightly increases a model's risk to succumbing to membership inference attacks in all cases including in differentially private models.

**Abstract:** Reward shaping (RS) is a powerful method in reinforcement learning (RL) for overcoming the problem of sparse or uninformative rewards. However, RS typically relies on manually engineered shaping-reward functions whose construction is time-consuming and error-prone. It also requires domain knowledge which runs contrary to the goal of autonomous learning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Optimising Shaping Algorithm (ROSA), an automated RS framework in which the shaping-reward function is constructed in a novel Markov game between two agents. A reward-shaping agent (Shaper) uses switching controls to determine which states to add shaping rewards and their optimal values while the other agent (Controller) learns the optimal policy for the task using these shaped rewards. We prove that ROSA, which easily adopts existing RL algorithms, learns to construct a shaping-reward function that is tailored to the task thus ensuring efficient convergence to high performance policies. We demonstrate ROSA's congenial properties in three carefully designed experiments and show its superior performance against state-of-the-art RS algorithms in challenging sparse reward environments.

**Abstract:** The $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{H}(\text{b}\bar{\text{b}})$ process is an essential channel to reveal the Higgs properties but has an irreducible background from the $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ process, which produces a top quark pair in association with a b quark pair. Therefore, understanding the $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ process is crucial for improving the sensitivity of a search for the $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{H}(\text{b}\bar{\text{b}})$ process. To this end, when measuring the differential cross-section of the $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ process, we need to distinguish the b-jets originated from top quark decays, and additional b-jets originated from gluon splitting. Since there are no simple identification rules, we adopt deep learning methods to learn from data to identify the additional b-jets from the $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ events. Specifically, by exploiting the special structure of the $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ event data, we propose several loss functions that can be minimized to directly increase the matching efficiency, the accuracy of identifying additional b-jets. We discuss the difference between our method and another deep learning-based approach based on binary classification arXiv:1910.14535 using synthetic data. We then verify that additional b-jets can be identified more accurately by increasing matching efficiency directly rather than the binary classification accuracy, using simulated $\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}\text{b}\bar{\text{b}}$ event data in the lepton+jets channel from pp collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV.

**Abstract:** Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) produces three dimensional distribution of refractive index (RI) by measuring scattering fields at various angles. Although the distribution of RI index is highly informative, due to the missing cone problem stemming from the limited-angle acquisition of holograms, reconstructions have very poor resolution along axial direction compared to the horizontal imaging plane. To solve this issue, here we present a novel unsupervised deep learning framework, which learns the probability distribution of missing projection views through optimal transport driven cycleGAN. Experimental results show that missing cone artifact in ODT can be significantly resolved by the proposed method.
