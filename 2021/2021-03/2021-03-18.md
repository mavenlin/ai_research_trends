**Abstract:** While GPTs with traditional fine-tuning fail to achieve strong results on natural language understanding (NLU), we show that GPTs can be better than or comparable to similar-sized BERTs on NLU tasks with a novel method P-tuning -- which employs trainable continuous prompt embeddings. On the knowledge probing (LAMA) benchmark, the best GPT recovers 64\% (P@1) of world knowledge without any additional text provided during test time, which substantially improves the previous best by 20+ percentage points. On the SuperGlue benchmark, GPTs achieve comparable and sometimes better performance to similar-sized BERTs in supervised learning. Importantly, we find that P-tuning also improves BERTs' performance in both few-shot and supervised settings while largely reducing the need for prompt engineering. Consequently, P-tuning outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the few-shot SuperGlue benchmark.

**Abstract:** There have been various types of pretraining architectures including autoregressive models (e.g., GPT), autoencoding models (e.g., BERT), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5). On the other hand, NLP tasks are different in nature, with three main categories being classification, unconditional generation, and conditional generation. However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs the best for all tasks, which introduces inconvenience for model development and selection. We propose a novel pretraining framework GLM (General Language Model) to address this challenge. Compared to previous work, our architecture has three major benefits: (1) it performs well on classification, unconditional generation, and conditional generation tasks with one single pretrained model; (2) it outperforms BERT-like models on classification due to improved pretrain-finetune consistency; (3) it naturally handles variable-length blank filling which is crucial for many downstream tasks. Empirically, GLM substantially outperforms BERT on the SuperGLUE natural language understanding benchmark with the same amount of pre-training data. Moreover, GLM with 1.25x parameters of BERT-Large achieves the best performance in NLU, conditional and unconditional generation at the same time, which demonstrates its generalizability to different downstream tasks.

<p>

**Abstract:** Numerous task-specific variants of conditional generative adversarial networks have been developed for image completion. Yet, a serious limitation remains that all existing algorithms tend to fail when handling large-scale missing regions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a generic new approach that bridges the gap between image-conditional and recent modulated unconditional generative architectures via co-modulation of both conditional and stochastic style representations. Also, due to the lack of good quantitative metrics for image completion, we propose the new Paired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P-IDS/U-IDS), which robustly measures the perceptual fidelity of inpainted images compared to real images via linear separability in a feature space. Experiments demonstrate superior performance in terms of both quality and diversity over state-of-the-art methods in free-form image completion and easy generalization to image-to-image translation.

<p>

**Abstract:** In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks have become ubiquitous in both research and public perception, but how GANs convert an unstructured latent code to a high quality output is still an open question. In this work, we investigate regression into the latent space as a probe to understand the compositional properties of GANs. We find that combining the regressor and a pretrained generator provides a strong image prior, allowing us to create composite images from a collage of random image parts at inference time while maintaining global consistency. To compare compositional properties across different generators, we measure the trade-offs between reconstruction of the unrealistic input and image quality of the regenerated samples. We find that the regression approach enables more localized editing of individual image parts compared to direct editing in the latent space, and we conduct experiments to quantify this independence effect. Our method is agnostic to the semantics of edits, and does not require labels or predefined concepts during training. Beyond image composition, our method extends to a number of related applications, such as image inpainting or example-based image editing, which we demonstrate on several GANs and datasets, and because it uses only a single forward pass, it can operate in real-time. Code is available on our project page: https://chail.github.io/latent-composition/.

**Abstract:** Medical imaging is an important research field with many opportunities for improving patients' health. However, there are a number of challenges that are slowing down the progress of the field as a whole, such optimizing for publication. In this paper we reviewed several problems related to choosing datasets, methods, evaluation metrics, and publication strategies. With a review of literature and our own analysis, we show that at every step, potential biases can creep in. On a positive note, we also see that initiatives to counteract these problems are already being started. Finally we provide a broad range of recommendations on how to further these address problems in the future. For reproducibility, data and code for our analyses are available on \url{https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/ml_med_imaging_failures}

**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have become the model of choice in natural language processing and are now being introduced into computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, in the field of human pose estimation, convolutional architectures still remain dominant. In this work, we present PoseFormer, a purely transformer-based approach for 3D human pose estimation in videos without convolutional architectures involved. Inspired by recent developments in vision transformers, we design a spatial-temporal transformer structure to comprehensively model the human joint relations within each frame as well as the temporal correlations across frames, then output an accurate 3D human pose of the center frame. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on two popular and standard benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments show that PoseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/zczcwh/PoseFormer}

**Abstract:** Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with contracting and expanding paths have shown prominence for the majority of medical image segmentation applications since the past decade. In FCNNs, the encoder plays an integral role by learning both global and local features and contextual representations which can be utilized for semantic output prediction by the decoder. Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. We introduce a novel architecture, dubbed as UNEt TRansformers (UNETR), that utilizes a transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume and effectively capture the global multi-scale information, while also following the successful "U-shaped" network design for the encoder and decoder. The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via skip connections at different resolutions to compute the final semantic segmentation output. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for multi-organ segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks. Our benchmarks demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance on the BTCV leaderboard. Code: https://monai.io/research/unetr

**Abstract:** Automatic augmentation methods have recently become a crucial pillar for strong model performance in vision tasks. While existing automatic augmentation methods need to trade off simplicity, cost and performance, we present a most simple baseline, TrivialAugment, that outperforms previous methods for almost free. TrivialAugment is parameter-free and only applies a single augmentation to each image. Thus, TrivialAugment's effectiveness is very unexpected to us and we performed very thorough experiments to study its performance. First, we compare TrivialAugment to previous state-of-the-art methods in a variety of image classification scenarios. Then, we perform multiple ablation studies with different augmentation spaces, augmentation methods and setups to understand the crucial requirements for its performance. Additionally, we provide a simple interface to facilitate the widespread adoption of automatic augmentation methods, as well as our full code base for reproducibility. Since our work reveals a stagnation in many parts of automatic augmentation research, we end with a short proposal of best practices for sustained future progress in automatic augmentation methods.

**Abstract:** Modern visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) are faced with a critical challenge in real-world deployment: they need to operate reliably and robustly in highly dynamic environments. Current best solutions merely filter dynamic objects as outliers based on the semantics of the object category. Such an approach does not scale as it requires semantic classifiers to encompass all possibly-moving object classes; this is hard to define, let alone deploy. On the other hand, many real-world environments exhibit strong structural regularities in the form of planes such as walls and ground surfaces, which are also crucially static. We present RP-VIO, a monocular visual-inertial odometry system that leverages the simple geometry of these planes for improved robustness and accuracy in challenging dynamic environments. Since existing datasets have a limited number of dynamic elements, we also present a highly-dynamic, photorealistic synthetic dataset for a more effective evaluation of the capabilities of modern VINS systems. We evaluate our approach on this dataset, and three diverse sequences from standard datasets including two real-world dynamic sequences and show a significant improvement in robustness and accuracy over a state-of-the-art monocular visual-inertial odometry system. We also show in simulation an improvement over a simple dynamic-features masking approach. Our code and dataset are publicly available.

**Abstract:** Active learning aims to improve the performance of task model by selecting the most informative samples with a limited budget. Unlike most recent works that focused on applying active learning for image classification, we propose an effective Consistency-based Active Learning method for object Detection (CALD), which fully explores the consistency between original and augmented data. CALD has three appealing benefits. (i) CALD is systematically designed by investigating the weaknesses of existing active learning methods, which do not take the unique challenges of object detection into account. (ii) CALD unifies box regression and classification with a single metric, which is not concerned by active learning methods for classification. CALD also focuses on the most informative local region rather than the whole image, which is beneficial for object detection. (iii) CALD not only gauges individual information for sample selection, but also leverages mutual information to encourage a balanced data distribution. Extensive experiments show that CALD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art task-agnostic and detection-specific active learning methods on general object detection datasets. Based on the Faster R-CNN detector, CALD consistently surpasses the baseline method (random selection) by 2.9/2.8/0.8 mAP on average on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO.

**Abstract:** In real-world tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently encounter situations that are not present during training time. To ensure reliable performance, the RL agents need to exhibit robustness against worst-case situations. The robust RL framework addresses this challenge via a worst-case optimization between an agent and an adversary. Previous robust RL algorithms are either sample inefficient, lack robustness guarantees, or do not scale to large problems. We propose the Robust Hallucinated Upper-Confidence RL (RH-UCRL) algorithm to provably solve this problem while attaining near-optimal sample complexity guarantees. RH-UCRL is a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm that effectively distinguishes between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and efficiently explores both the agent and adversary decision spaces during policy learning. We scale RH-UCRL to complex tasks via neural networks ensemble models as well as neural network policies. Experimentally, we demonstrate that RH-UCRL outperforms other robust deep RL algorithms in a variety of adversarial environments.

**Abstract:** Availability of powerful computation and communication technology as well as advances in artificial intelligence enable a new generation of complex, AI-intense systems and applications. Such systems and applications promise exciting improvements on a societal level, yet they also bring with them new challenges for their development. In this paper we argue that significant challenges relate to defining and ensuring behaviour and quality attributes of such systems and applications. We specifically derive four challenge areas from relevant use cases of complex, AI-intense systems and applications related to industry, transportation, and home automation: understanding, determining, and specifying (i) contextual definitions and requirements, (ii) data attributes and requirements, (iii) performance definition and monitoring, and (iv) the impact of human factors on system acceptance and success. Solving these challenges will imply process support that integrates new requirements engineering methods into development approaches for complex, AI-intense systems and applications. We present these challenges in detail and propose a research roadmap.

**Abstract:** Explainability for machine learning models has gained considerable attention within the research community given the importance of deploying more reliable machine-learning systems. In computer vision applications, generative counterfactual methods indicate how to perturb a model's input to change its prediction, providing details about the model's decision-making. Current methods tend to generate trivial counterfactuals about a model's decisions, as they often suggest to exaggerate or remove the presence of the attribute being classified. For the machine learning practitioner, these types of counterfactuals offer little value, since they provide no new information about undesired model or data biases. In this work, we identify the problem of trivial counterfactual generation and we propose DiVE to alleviate it. DiVE learns a perturbation in a disentangled latent space that is constrained using a diversity-enforcing loss to uncover multiple valuable explanations about the model's prediction. Further, we introduce a mechanism to prevent the model from producing trivial explanations. Experiments on CelebA and Synbols demonstrate that our model improves the success rate of producing high-quality valuable explanations when compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/ElementAI/beyond-trivial-explanations.

**Abstract:** The introduction of Transformer model has led to tremendous advancements in sequence modeling, especially in text domain. However, the use of attention-based models for video understanding is still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Gated Adversarial Transformer (GAT) to enhance the applicability of attention-based models to videos. GAT uses a multi-level attention gate to model the relevance of a frame based on local and global contexts. This enables the model to understand the video at various granularities. Further, GAT uses adversarial training to improve model generalization. We propose temporal attention regularization scheme to improve the robustness of attention modules to adversarial examples. We illustrate the performance of GAT on the large-scale YoutTube-8M data set on the task of video categorization. We further show ablation studies along with quantitative and qualitative analysis to showcase the improvement.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a novel deep online correction (DOC) framework for monocular visual odometry. The whole pipeline has two stages: First, depth maps and initial poses are obtained from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained in self-supervised manners. Second, the poses predicted by CNNs are further improved by minimizing photometric errors via gradient updates of poses during inference phases. The benefits of our proposed method are twofold: 1) Different from online-learning methods, DOC does not need to calculate gradient propagation for parameters of CNNs. Thus, it saves more computation resources during inference phases. 2) Unlike hybrid methods that combine CNNs with traditional methods, DOC fully relies on deep learning (DL) frameworks. Though without complex back-end optimization modules, our method achieves outstanding performance with relative transform error (RTE) = 2.0% on KITTI Odometry benchmark for Seq. 09, which outperforms traditional monocular VO frameworks and is comparable to hybrid methods.

<p>

**Abstract:** Direct decoding for task-oriented dialogue is known to suffer from the explaining-away effect, manifested in models that prefer short and generic responses. Here we argue for the use of Bayes' theorem to factorize the dialogue task into two models, the distribution of the context given the response, and the prior for the response itself. This approach, an instantiation of the noisy channel model, both mitigates the explaining-away effect and allows the principled incorporation of large pretrained models for the response prior. We present extensive experiments showing that a noisy channel model decodes better responses compared to direct decoding and that a two stage pretraining strategy, employing both open-domain and task-oriented dialogue data, improves over randomly initialized models.

**Abstract:** Most statistical classifiers are designed to find patterns in data where numbers fit into rows and columns, like in a spreadsheet, but many kinds of data do not conform to this structure. To uncover patterns in non-conforming data, we describe an approach for modifying established statistical classifiers to handle non-conforming data, which we call dynamic kernel matching (DKM). As examples of non-conforming data, we consider (i) a dataset of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences labelled by disease antigen and (ii) a dataset of sequenced TCR repertoires labelled by patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, anticipating that both datasets contain signatures for diagnosing disease. We successfully fit statistical classifiers augmented with DKM to both datasets and report the performance on holdout data using standard metrics and metrics allowing for indeterminant diagnoses. Finally, we identify the patterns used by our statistical classifiers to generate predictions and show that these patterns agree with observations from experimental studies.

**Abstract:** Virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality (AR) technology is increasingly combined with eye-tracking. This combination broadens both fields and opens up new areas of application, in which visual perception and related cognitive processes can be studied in interactive but still well controlled settings. However, performing a semantic gaze analysis of eye-tracking data from interactive three-dimensional scenes is a resource-intense task, which so far has been an obstacle to economic use. In this paper we present a novel approach which minimizes time and information necessary to annotate volumes of interest (VOIs) by using techniques from object recognition. To do so, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on synthetic data sets derived from virtual models using image augmentation techniques. We evaluate our method in real and virtual environments, showing that the method can compete with state-of-the-art approaches, while not relying on additional markers or preexisting databases but instead offering cross-platform use.

<p>

**Abstract:** We analyse the impact of the selective pressure for the global optimisation capabilities of steady-state EAs. For the standard bimodal benchmark function \twomax we rigorously prove that using uniform parent selection leads to exponential runtimes with high probability to locate both optima for the standard ($Î¼$+1)~EA and ($Î¼$+1)~RLS with any polynomial population sizes. On the other hand, we prove that selecting the worst individual as parent leads to efficient global optimisation with overwhelming probability for reasonable population sizes. Since always selecting the worst individual may have detrimental effects for escaping from local optima, we consider the performance of stochastic parent selection operators with low selective pressure for a function class called \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} where one slope is shorter than the other. An experimental analysis shows that the EAs equipped with inverse tournament selection, where the loser is selected for reproduction and small tournament sizes, globally optimise \textsc{TwoMax} efficiently and effectively escape from local optima of \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} with high probability. Thus they identify both optima efficiently while uniform (or stronger) selection fails in theory and in practice. We then show the power of inverse selection on function classes from the literature where populations are essential by providing rigorous proofs or experimental evidence that it outperforms uniform selection equipped with or without a restart strategy. We conclude the paper by confirming our theoretical insights with an empirical analysis of the different selective pressures on standard benchmarks of the classical MaxSat and Multidimensional Knapsack Problems.

<p>

**Abstract:** We establish a direct connection between general tensor networks and deep feed-forward artificial neural networks. The core of our results is the construction of neural-network layers that efficiently perform tensor contractions, and that use commonly adopted non-linear activation functions. The resulting deep networks feature a number of edges that closely matches the contraction complexity of the tensor networks to be approximated. In the context of many-body quantum states, this result establishes that neural-network states have strictly the same or higher expressive power than practically usable variational tensor networks. As an example, we show that all matrix product states can be efficiently written as neural-network states with a number of edges polynomial in the bond dimension and depth logarithmic in the system size. The opposite instead does not hold true, and our results imply that there exist quantum states that are not efficiently expressible in terms of matrix product states or practically usable PEPS, but that are instead efficiently expressible with neural network states.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a new methodology for performing Bayesian inference in imaging inverse problems where the prior knowledge is available in the form of training data. Following the manifold hypothesis and adopting a generative modelling approach, we construct a data-driven prior that is supported on a sub-manifold of the ambient space, which we can learn from the training data by using a variational autoencoder or a generative adversarial network. We establish the existence and well-posedness of the associated posterior distribution and posterior moments under easily verifiable conditions, providing a rigorous underpinning for Bayesian estimators and uncertainty quantification analyses. Bayesian computation is performed by using a parallel tempered version of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm on the manifold, which is shown to be ergodic and robust to the non-convex nature of these data-driven models. In addition to point estimators and uncertainty quantification analyses, we derive a model misspecification test to automatically detect situations where the data-driven prior is unreliable, and explain how to identify the dimension of the latent space directly from the training data. The proposed approach is illustrated with a range of experiments with the MNIST dataset, where it outperforms alternative image reconstruction approaches from the state of the art. A model accuracy analysis suggests that the Bayesian probabilities reported by the data-driven models are also remarkably accurate under a frequentist definition of probability.

**Abstract:** A variety of effective face-swap and face-reenactment methods have been publicized in recent years, democratizing the face synthesis technology to a great extent. Videos generated as such have come to be called deepfakes with a negative connotation, for various social problems they have caused. Facing the emerging threat of deepfakes, we have built the Korean DeepFake Detection Dataset (KoDF), a large-scale collection of synthesized and real videos focused on Korean subjects. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of methods used to construct the dataset, experimentally show the discrepancy between the distributions of KoDF and existing deepfake detection datasets, and underline the importance of using multiple datasets for real-world generalization. KoDF is publicly available at https://moneybrain-research.github.io/kodf in its entirety (i.e. real clips, synthesized clips, clips with adversarial attack, and metadata).

**Abstract:** In recent years, the availability of digitized Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has enabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated disease diagnosis. However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic challenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\sim$100K pixels), making them infeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often only slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are tedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the representations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end framework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples ${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention mechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training by exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches. We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level cross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss (Implementation: https://github.com/YashSharma/C2C).

**Abstract:** Searching for novel molecules with desired chemical properties is crucial in drug discovery. Existing work focuses on developing neural models to generate either molecular sequences or chemical graphs. However, it remains a big challenge to find novel and diverse compounds satisfying several properties. In this paper, we propose MARS, a method for multi-objective drug molecule discovery. MARS is based on the idea of generating the chemical candidates by iteratively editing fragments of molecular graphs. To search for high-quality candidates, it employs Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) on molecules with an annealing scheme and an adaptive proposal. To further improve sample efficiency, MARS uses a graph neural network (GNN) to represent and select candidate edits, where the GNN is trained on-the-fly with samples from MCMC. Experiments show that MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-objective settings where molecular bio-activity, drug-likeness, and synthesizability are considered. Remarkably, in the most challenging setting where all four objectives are simultaneously optimized, our approach outperforms previous methods significantly in comprehensive evaluations.

**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks are highly over-parameterized compared to the data on which they are trained, yet they often generalize remarkably well. A flurry of recent work has asked: why do deep networks not overfit to their training data? In this work, we make a series of empirical observations that investigate the hypothesis that deeper networks are inductively biased to find solutions with lower rank embeddings. We conjecture that this bias exists because the volume of functions that maps to low-rank embedding increases with depth. We show empirically that our claim holds true on finite width linear and non-linear models and show that these are the solutions that generalize well. We then show that the low-rank simplicity bias exists even after training, using a wide variety of commonly used optimizers. We found this phenomenon to be resilient to initialization, hyper-parameters, and learning methods. We further demonstrate how linear over-parameterization of deep non-linear models can be used to induce low-rank bias, improving generalization performance without changing the effective model capacity. Practically, we demonstrate that simply linearly over-parameterizing standard models at training time can improve performance on image classification tasks, including ImageNet.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate an object tracking method for 3D images with fixed computational cost and state-of-the-art performance. Previous methods predicted transformation parameters from convolutional layers. We instead propose an architecture that does not include either flattening of convolutional features or fully connected layers, but instead relies on equivariant filters to preserve transformations between inputs and outputs (e.g. rot./trans. of inputs rotate/translate outputs). The transformation is then derived in closed form from the outputs of the filters. This method is useful for applications requiring low latency, such as real-time tracking. We demonstrate our model on synthetically augmented adult brain MRI, as well as fetal brain MRI, which is the intended use-case.

**Abstract:** The recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have demonstrated the potential for providing a powerful solution to build complex prediction systems in a short time. However, in highly regulated industries, such as the financial technology (Fintech), people have raised concerns about the risk of ML systems discriminating against specific protected groups or individuals. To address these concerns, researchers have introduced various mathematical fairness metrics and bias mitigation algorithms. This paper discusses hidden technical debts and challenges of building fair ML systems in a production environment for Fintech. We explore various stages that require attention for fairness in the ML system development and deployment life cycle. To identify hidden technical debts that exist in building fair ML system for Fintech, we focus on key pipeline stages including data preparation, model development, system monitoring and integration in production. Our analysis shows that enforcing fairness for production-ready ML systems in Fintech requires specific engineering commitments at different stages of ML system life cycle. We also propose several initial starting points to mitigate these technical debts for deploying fair ML systems in production.

**Abstract:** In recent years, researchers have proposed many deep learning (DL) methods for various tasks, and particularly face recognition (FR) made an enormous leap using these techniques. Deep FR systems benefit from the hierarchical architecture of the DL methods to learn discriminative face representation. Therefore, DL techniques significantly improve state-of-the-art performance on FR systems and encourage diverse and efficient real-world applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of various FR systems that leverage the different types of DL techniques, and for the study, we summarize 168 recent contributions from this area. We discuss the papers related to different algorithms, architectures, loss functions, activation functions, datasets, challenges, improvement ideas, current and future trends of DL-based FR systems. We provide a detailed discussion of various DL methods to understand the current state-of-the-art, and then we discuss various activation and loss functions for the methods. Additionally, we summarize different datasets used widely for FR tasks and discuss challenges related to illumination, expression, pose variations, and occlusion. Finally, we discuss improvement ideas, current and future trends of FR tasks.

**Abstract:** We propose OmniPose, a single-pass, end-to-end trainable framework, that achieves state-of-the-art results for multi-person pose estimation. Using a novel waterfall module, the OmniPose architecture leverages multi-scale feature representations that increase the effectiveness of backbone feature extractors, without the need for post-processing. OmniPose incorporates contextual information across scales and joint localization with Gaussian heatmap modulation at the multi-scale feature extractor to estimate human pose with state-of-the-art accuracy. The multi-scale representations, obtained by the improved waterfall module in OmniPose, leverage the efficiency of progressive filtering in the cascade architecture, while maintaining multi-scale fields-of-view comparable to spatial pyramid configurations. Our results on multiple datasets demonstrate that OmniPose, with an improved HRNet backbone and waterfall module, is a robust and efficient architecture for multi-person pose estimation that achieves state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** Mechanistic models with differential equations are a key component of scientific applications of machine learning. Inference in such models is usually computationally demanding, because it involves repeatedly solving the differential equation. The main problem here is that the numerical solver is hard to combine with standard inference techniques. Recent work in probabilistic numerics has developed a new class of solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that phrase the solution process directly in terms of Bayesian filtering. We here show that this allows such methods to be combined very directly, with conceptual and numerical ease, with latent force models in the ODE itself. It then becomes possible to perform approximate Bayesian inference on the latent force as well as the ODE solution in a single, linear complexity pass of an extended Kalman filter / smoother - that is, at the cost of computing a single ODE solution. We demonstrate the expressiveness and performance of the algorithm by training, among others, a non-parametric SIRD model on data from the COVID-19 outbreak.

**Abstract:** The rise of social media has led to the increasing of comments on online forums. However, there still exists invalid comments which are not informative for users. Moreover, those comments are also quite toxic and harmful to people. In this paper, we create a dataset for constructive and toxic speech detection, named UIT-ViCTSD (Vietnamese Constructive and Toxic Speech Detection dataset) with 10,000 human-annotated comments. For these tasks, we propose a system for constructive and toxic speech detection with the state-of-the-art transfer learning model in Vietnamese NLP as PhoBERT. With this system, we obtain F1-scores of 78.59% and 59.40% for classifying constructive and toxic comments, respectively. Besides, we implement various baseline models as traditional Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network-Based models to evaluate the dataset. With the results, we can solve several tasks on the online discussions and develop the framework for identifying constructiveness and toxicity of Vietnamese social media comments automatically.

**Abstract:** In Multiple Instance learning (MIL), weak labels are provided at the bag level with only presence/absence information known. However, there is a considerable gap in performance in comparison to a fully supervised model, limiting the practical applicability of MIL approaches. Thus, this paper introduces a novel semi-weak label learning paradigm as a middle ground to mitigate the problem. We define semi-weak label data as data where we know the presence or absence of a given class and the exact count of each class as opposed to knowing the label proportions. We then propose a two-stage framework to address the problem of learning from semi-weak labels. It leverages the fact that counting information is non-negative and discrete. Experiments are conducted on generated samples from CIFAR-10. We compare our model with a fully-supervised setting baseline, a weakly-supervised setting baseline and learning from pro-portion (LLP) baseline. Our framework not only outperforms both baseline models for MIL-based weakly super-vised setting and learning from proportion setting, but also gives comparable results compared to the fully supervised model. Further, we conduct thorough ablation studies to analyze across datasets and variation with batch size, losses architectural changes, bag size and regularization

**Abstract:** High screening coverage during colonoscopy is crucial to effectively prevent colon cancer. Previous work has allowed alerting the doctor to unsurveyed regions by reconstructing the 3D colonoscopic surface from colonoscopy videos in real-time. However, the lighting inconsistency of colonoscopy videos can cause a key component of the colonoscopic reconstruction system, the SLAM optimization, to fail. In this work we focus on the lighting problem in colonoscopy videos. To successfully improve the lighting consistency of colonoscopy videos, we have found necessary a lighting correction that adapts to the intensity distribution of recent video frames. To achieve this in real-time, we have designed and trained an RNN network. This network adapts the gamma value in a gamma-correction process. Applied in the colonoscopic surface reconstruction system, our light-weight model significantly boosts the reconstruction success rate, making a larger proportion of colonoscopy video segments reconstructable and improving the reconstruction quality of the already reconstructed segments.

**Abstract:** Domain generalization is a sub-field of transfer learning that aims at bridging the gap between two different domains in the absence of any knowledge about the target domain. Our approach tackles the problem of a model's weak generalization when it is trained on a single source domain. From this perspective, we build an ensemble model on top of base deep learning models trained on a single source to enhance the generalization of their collective prediction. The results achieved thus far have demonstrated promising improvements of the ensemble over any of its base learners.

**Abstract:** Deep learning is finding its way into high energy physics by replacing traditional Monte Carlo simulations. However, deep learning still requires an excessive amount of computational resources. A promising approach to make deep learning more efficient is to quantize the parameters of the neural networks to reduced precision. Reduced precision computing is extensively used in modern deep learning and results to lower execution inference time, smaller memory footprint and less memory bandwidth. In this paper we analyse the effects of low precision inference on a complex deep generative adversarial network model. The use case which we are addressing is calorimeter detector simulations of subatomic particle interactions in accelerator based high energy physics. We employ the novel Intel low precision optimization tool (iLoT) for quantization and compare the results to the quantized model from TensorFlow Lite. In the performance benchmark we gain a speed-up of 1.73x on Intel hardware for the quantized iLoT model compared to the initial, not quantized, model. With different physics-inspired self-developed metrics, we validate that the quantized iLoT model shows a lower loss of physical accuracy in comparison to the TensorFlow Lite model.

**Abstract:** Early detection of dementia through specific biomarkers in MR images plays a critical role in developing support strategies proactively. Fazekas scale facilitates an accurate quantitative assessment of the severity of white matter lesions and hence the disease. Imaging Biomarkers of dementia are multiple and comprehensive documentation of them is time-consuming. Therefore, any effort to automatically extract these biomarkers will be of clinical value while reducing inter-rater discrepancies. To tackle this problem, we propose to classify the disease severity based on the Fazekas scale through the visual biomarkers, namely the Periventricular White Matter (PVWM) and the Deep White Matter (DWM) changes, in the real-world setting of thick-slice MRI. Small training sample size and weak supervision in form of assigning severity labels to the whole MRI stack are among the main challenges. To combat the mentioned issues, we have developed a deep learning pipeline that employs self-supervised representation learning, multiple instance learning, and appropriate pre-processing steps. We use pretext tasks such as non-linear transformation, local shuffling, in- and out-painting for self-supervised learning of useful features in this domain. Furthermore, an attention model is used to determine the relevance of each MRI slice for predicting the Fazekas scale in an unsupervised manner. We show the significant superiority of our method in distinguishing different classes of dementia compared to state-of-the-art methods in our mentioned setting, which improves the macro averaged F1-score of state-of-the-art from 61% to 76% in PVWM, and from 58% to 69.2% in DWM.

**Abstract:** Post-training quantization is a representative technique for compressing neural networks, making them smaller and more efficient for deployment on edge devices. However, an inaccessible user dataset often makes it difficult to ensure the quality of the quantized neural network in practice. In addition, existing approaches may use a single uniform bit-width across the network, resulting in significant accuracy degradation at extremely low bit-widths. To utilize multiple bit-width, sensitivity metric plays a key role in balancing accuracy and compression. In this paper, we propose a novel sensitivity metric that considers the effect of quantization error on task loss and interaction with other layers. Moreover, we develop labeled data generation methods that are not dependent on a specific operation of the neural network. Our experiments show that the proposed metric better represents quantization sensitivity, and generated data are more feasible to be applied to mixed-precision quantization.

**Abstract:** Malicious URL detection is an emerging research area due to continuous modernization of various systems, for instance, Edge Computing. In this article, we present a novel malicious URL detection technique, called deepBF (deep learning and Bloom Filter). deepBF is presented in two-fold. Firstly, we propose a learned Bloom Filter using 2-dimensional Bloom Filter. We experimentally decide the best non-cryptography string hash function. Then, we derive a modified non-cryptography string hash function from the selected hash function for deepBF by introducing biases in the hashing method and compared among the string hash functions. The modified string hash function is compared to other variants of diverse non-cryptography string hash functions. It is also compared with various filters, particularly, counting Bloom Filter, Kirsch \textit{et al.}, and Cuckoo Filter using various use cases. The use cases unearth weakness and strength of the filters. Secondly, we propose a malicious URL detection mechanism using deepBF. We apply the evolutionary convolutional neural network to identify the malicious URLs. The evolutionary convolutional neural network is trained and tested with malicious URL datasets. The output is tested in deepBF for accuracy. We have achieved many conclusions from our experimental evaluation and results and are able to reach various conclusive decisions which are presented in the article.

**Abstract:** Learning 3D representations that generalize well to arbitrarily oriented inputs is a challenge of practical importance in applications varying from computer vision to physics and chemistry. We propose a novel multi-resolution convolutional architecture for learning over concentric spherical feature maps, of which the single sphere representation is a special case. Our hierarchical architecture is based on alternatively learning to incorporate both intra-sphere and inter-sphere information. We show the applicability of our method for two different types of 3D inputs, mesh objects, which can be regularly sampled, and point clouds, which are irregularly distributed. We also propose an efficient mapping of point clouds to concentric spherical images, thereby bridging spherical convolutions on grids with general point clouds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving state-of-the-art performance on 3D classification tasks with rotated data.

Their network offers novel ways to probe its dual abilities to read text while classifying visual objects. This paper demonstrates several new categories of adversarial attacks, spanning basic typographical, conceptual, and iconographic inputs generated to fool the model into making false or absurd classifications. We demonstrate that contradictory text and image signals can confuse the model into choosing false (visual) options. Like previous authors, we show by example that the CLIP model tends to read first, look later, a phenomenon we describe as reading isn't believing.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification tasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets, and are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior works reveal such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which compute the importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to align the importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model behaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks flexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined list of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as feature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In this work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by collecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases. By parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified refinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more training examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing adjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify model behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain as well as improved model fairness after refinement.

**Abstract:** Supervised learning techniques are at the center of many tasks in remote sensing. Unfortunately, these methods, especially recent deep learning methods, often require large amounts of labeled data for training. Even though satellites acquire large amounts of data, labeling the data is often tedious, expensive and requires expert knowledge. Hence, improved methods that require fewer labeled samples are needed. We present MSMatch, the first semi-supervised learning approach competitive with supervised methods on scene classification on the EuroSAT and UC Merced Land Use benchmark datasets. We test both RGB and multispectral images of EuroSAT and perform various ablation studies to identify the critical parts of the model. The trained neural network achieves state-of-the-art results on EuroSAT with an accuracy that is up to 19.76% better than previous methods depending on the number of labeled training examples. With just five labeled examples per class, we reach 94.53% and 95.86% accuracy on the EuroSAT RGB and multispectral datasets, respectively. On the UC Merced Land Use dataset, we outperform previous works by up to 5.59% and reach 90.71% with five labeled examples. Our results show that MSMatch is capable of greatly reducing the requirements for labeled data. It translates well to multispectral data and should enable various applications that are currently infeasible due to a lack of labeled data. We provide the source code of MSMatch online to enable easy reproduction and quick adoption.

**Abstract:** To facilitate implementation of high-accuracy deep neural networks especially on resource-constrained devices, maintaining low computation requirements is crucial. Using very deep models for classification purposes not only decreases the neural network training speed and increases the inference time, but also need more data for higher prediction accuracy and to mitigate false positives.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight deep classification ensemble structure based on a combination of simple color features, which is particularly designed for "high-accuracy" image classifications with low false positives. We designed, implemented, and evaluated our approach for explosion detection use-case applied to images and videos. Our evaluation results based on a large test test show considerable improvements on the prediction accuracy compared to the popular ResNet-50 model, while benefiting from 7.64x faster inference and lower computation cost.
  While we applied our approach to explosion detection, our approach is general and can be applied to other similar classification use cases as well. Given the insight gained from our experiments, we hence propose a "think small, think many" philosophy in classification scenarios: that transforming a single, large, monolithic deep model into a verification-based step model ensemble of multiple small, simple, lightweight models with narrowed-down color spaces can possibly lead to predictions with higher accuracy.

**Abstract:** We consider black-box optimization in which only an extremely limited number of function evaluations, on the order of around 100, are affordable and the function evaluations must be performed in even fewer batches of a limited number of parallel trials. This is a typical scenario when optimizing variable settings that are very costly to evaluate, for example in the context of simulation-based optimization or machine learning hyperparameterization. We propose an original method that uses established approaches to propose a set of points for each batch and then down-selects from these candidate points to the number of trials that can be run in parallel. The key novelty of our approach lies in the introduction of a hyperparameterized method for down-selecting the number of candidates to the allowed batch-size, which is optimized offline using automated algorithm configuration. We tune this method for black box optimization and then evaluate on classical black box optimization benchmarks. Our results show that it is possible to learn how to combine evaluation points suggested by highly diverse black box optimization methods conditioned on the progress of the optimization. Compared with the state of the art in black box minimization and various other methods specifically geared towards few-shot minimization, we achieve an average reduction of 50\% of normalized cost, which is a highly significant improvement in performance.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of adaptive control of the linear quadratic regulator for systems in very high, or even infinite dimension. We demonstrate that while sublinear regret requires finite dimensional inputs, the ambient state dimension of the system need not be bounded in order to perform online control. We provide the first regret bounds for LQR which hold for infinite dimensional systems, replacing dependence on ambient dimension with more natural notions of problem complexity. Our guarantees arise from a novel perturbation bound for certainty equivalence which scales with the prediction error in estimating the system parameters, without requiring consistent parameter recovery in more stringent measures like the operator norm. When specialized to finite dimensional settings, our bounds recover near optimal dimension and time horizon dependence.

**Abstract:** We present a framework called Acquired Deep Impressions (ADI) which continuously learns knowledge of objects as "impressions" for compositional scene understanding. In this framework, the model first acquires knowledge from scene images containing a single object in a supervised manner, and then continues to learn from novel multi-object scene images which may contain objects that have not been seen before without any further supervision, under the guidance of the learned knowledge as humans do. By memorizing impressions of objects into parameters of neural networks and applying the generative replay strategy, the learned knowledge can be reused to generate images with pseudo-annotations and in turn assist the learning of novel scenes. The proposed ADI framework focuses on the acquisition and utilization of knowledge, and is complementary to existing deep generative models proposed for compositional scene representation. We adapt a base model to make it fall within the ADI framework and conduct experiments on two types of datasets. Empirical results suggest that the proposed framework is able to effectively utilize the acquired impressions and improve the scene decomposition performance.

**Abstract:** Automatic crash reporting systems have become a de-facto standard in software development. These systems monitor target software, and if a crash occurs they send details to a backend application. Later on, these reports are aggregated and used in the development process to 1) understand whether it is a new or an existing issue, 2) assign these bugs to appropriate developers, and 3) gain a general overview of the application's bug landscape. The efficiency of report aggregation and subsequent operations heavily depends on the quality of the report similarity metric. However, a distinctive feature of this kind of report is that no textual input from the user (i.e., bug description) is available: it contains only stack trace information.
  In this paper, we present S3M ("extreme") -- the first approach to computing stack trace similarity based on deep learning. It is based on a siamese architecture that uses a biLSTM encoder and a fully-connected classifier to compute similarity. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art on both open-sourced data and a private JetBrains dataset. Additionally, we review the impact of stack trace trimming on the quality of the results.

**Abstract:** The combination of cloud computing capabilities at the network edge and artificial intelligence promise to turn future mobile networks into service- and radio-aware entities, able to address the requirements of upcoming latency-sensitive applications. In this context, a challenging research goal is to exploit edge intelligence to dynamically and optimally manage the Radio Access Network Slicing (that is a less mature and more complex technology than fifth-generation Network Slicing) and Radio Resource Management, which is a very complex task due to the mostly unpredictably nature of the wireless channel. This paper presents a novel architecture that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning at the edge of the network in order to address Radio Access Network Slicing and Radio Resource Management optimization supporting latency-sensitive applications. The effectiveness of our proposal against baseline methodologies is investigated through computer simulation, by considering an autonomous-driving use-case.

**Abstract:** Recently, we have been witnessing an increasing use of machine learning methods in self-adaptive systems. Machine learning methods offer a variety of use cases for supporting self-adaptation, e.g., to keep runtime models up to date, reduce large adaptation spaces, or update adaptation rules. Yet, since machine learning methods apply in essence statistical methods, they may have an impact on the decisions made by a self-adaptive system. Given the wide use of formal approaches to provide guarantees for the decisions made by self-adaptive systems, it is important to investigate the impact of applying machine learning methods when such approaches are used. In this paper, we study one particular instance that combines linear regression to reduce the adaptation space of a self-adaptive system with statistical model checking to analyze the resulting adaptation options. We use computational learning theory to determine a theoretical bound on the impact of the machine learning method on the predictions made by the verifier. We illustrate and evaluate the theoretical result using a scenario of the DeltaIoT artifact. To conclude, we look at opportunities for future research in this area.

**Abstract:** Motivated by an application to drug repurposing, we propose the first algorithms to tackle the identification of the m $\ge$ 1 arms with largest means in a linear bandit model, in the fixed-confidence setting. These algorithms belong to the generic family of Gap-Index Focused Algorithms (GIFA) that we introduce for Top-m identification in linear bandits. We propose a unified analysis of these algorithms, which shows how the use of features might decrease the sample complexity. We further validate these algorithms empirically on simulated data and on a simple drug repurposing task.

**Abstract:** Given the great success of Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) and the black-box nature of it,the interpretability of these models becomes an important issue.The majority of previous research works on the post-hoc interpretation of a trained model.But recently, adversarial training shows that it is possible for a model to have an interpretable input-gradient through training.However,adversarial training lacks efficiency for interpretability.To resolve this problem, we construct an approximation of the adversarial perturbations and discover a connection between adversarial training and amplitude modulation. Based on a digital analogy,we propose noise modulation as an efficient and model-agnostic alternative to train a model that interprets itself with input-gradients.Experiment results show that noise modulation can effectively increase the interpretability of input-gradients model-agnosticly.

**Abstract:** Inductive inference in supervised classification context constitutes to methods and approaches to assign some objects or items into different predefined classes using a formal rule that is derived from training data and possibly some additional auxiliary information. The optimality of such an assignment varies under different conditions due to intrinsic attributes of the objects being considered for such a task. One of these cases is when all the objects' features are discrete variables with a priori known categories. As another example, one can consider a modification of this case with a priori unknown categories. These two cases are the main focus of this thesis and based on Bayesian inductive theories, de Finetti type exchangeability is a suitable assumption that facilitates the derivation of classifiers in the former scenario. On the contrary, this type of exchangeability is not applicable in the latter case, instead, it is possible to utilise the partition exchangeability due to John Kingman. These two types of exchangeabilities are discussed and furthermore here I investigate inductive supervised classifiers based on both types of exchangeabilities. I further demonstrate that the classifiers based on de Finetti type exchangeability can optimally handle test items independently of each other in the presence of infinite amounts of training data while on the other hand, classifiers based on partition exchangeability still continue to benefit from joint labelling of all the test items. Additionally, it is shown that the inductive learning process for the simultaneous classifier saturates when the amount of test data tends to infinity.

**Abstract:** A kitchen assistant needs to operate human-scale objects, such as cabinets and ovens, in unmapped environments with dynamic obstacles. Autonomous interactions in such real-world environments require integrating dexterous manipulation and fluid mobility. While mobile manipulators in different form-factors provide an extended workspace, their real-world adoption has been limited. This limitation is in part due to two main reasons: 1) inability to interact with unknown human-scale objects such as cabinets and ovens, and 2) inefficient coordination between the arm and the mobile base. Executing a high-level task for general objects requires a perceptual understanding of the object as well as adaptive whole-body control among dynamic obstacles. In this paper, we propose a two-stage architecture for autonomous interaction with large articulated objects in unknown environments. The first stage uses a learned model to estimate the articulated model of a target object from an RGB-D input and predicts an action-conditional sequence of states for interaction. The second stage comprises of a whole-body motion controller to manipulate the object along the generated kinematic plan. We show that our proposed pipeline can handle complicated static and dynamic kitchen settings. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance than commonly used control methods in mobile manipulation.

**Abstract:** Machine Learning (ML) seems to be one of the most promising solution to automate partially or completely some of the complex tasks currently realized by humans, such as driving vehicles, recognizing voice, etc. It is also an opportunity to implement and embed new capabilities out of the reach of classical implementation techniques. However, ML techniques introduce new potential risks. Therefore, they have only been applied in systems where their benefits are considered worth the increase of risk. In practice, ML techniques raise multiple challenges that could prevent their use in systems submitted to certification constraints. But what are the actual challenges? Can they be overcome by selecting appropriate ML techniques, or by adopting new engineering or certification practices? These are some of the questions addressed by the ML Certification 3 Workgroup (WG) set-up by the Institut de Recherche Technologique Saint ExupÃ©ry de Toulouse (IRT), as part of the DEEL Project.

**Abstract:** To perform manipulation tasks in the real world, robots need to operate on objects with various shapes, sizes and without access to geometric models. It is often unfeasible to train monolithic neural network policies across such large variance in object properties. Towards this generalization challenge, we propose to learn modular task policies which compose object-centric task-axes controllers. These task-axes controllers are parameterized by properties associated with underlying objects in the scene. We infer these controller parameters directly from visual input using multi-view dense correspondence learning. Our overall approach provides a simple, modular and yet powerful framework for learning manipulation tasks. We empirically evaluate our approach on multiple different manipulation tasks and show its ability to generalize to large variance in object size, shape and geometry.

**Abstract:** Context: Software engineering researchers have undertaken many experiments investigating the potential of software defect prediction algorithms. Unfortunately, some widely used performance metrics are known to be problematic, most notably F1, but nevertheless F1 is widely used.
  Objective: To investigate the potential impact of using F1 on the validity of this large body of research.
  Method: We undertook a systematic review to locate relevant experiments and then extract all pairwise comparisons of defect prediction performance using F1 and the un-biased Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).
  Results: We found a total of 38 primary studies. These contain 12,471 pairs of results. Of these, 21.95% changed direction when the MCC metric is used instead of the biased F1 metric. Unfortunately, we also found evidence suggesting that F1 remains widely used in software defect prediction research.
  Conclusions: We reiterate the concerns of statisticians that the F1 is a problematic metric outside of an information retrieval context, since we are concerned about both classes (defect-prone and not defect-prone units). This inappropriate usage has led to a substantial number (more than one fifth) of erroneous (in terms of direction) results. Therefore we urge researchers to (i) use an unbiased metric and (ii) publish detailed results including confusion matrices such that alternative analyses become possible.

**Abstract:** Mixture models are an expressive hypothesis class that can approximate a rich set of policies. However, using mixture policies in the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) framework is not straightforward. The entropy of a mixture model is not equal to the sum of its components, nor does it have a closed-form expression in most cases. Using such policies in MaxEnt algorithms, therefore, requires constructing a tractable approximation of the mixture entropy. In this paper, we derive a simple, low-variance mixture-entropy estimator. We show that it is closely related to the sum of marginal entropies. Equipped with our entropy estimator, we derive an algorithmic variant of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to the mixture policy case and evaluate it on a series of continuous control tasks.

**Abstract:** Automatic analysis of bioacoustic signals is a fundamental tool to evaluate the vitality of our planet. Frogs and bees, for instance, may act like biological sensors providing information about environmental changes. This task is fundamental for ecological monitoring still includes many challenges such as nonuniform signal length processing, degraded target signal due to environmental noise, and the scarcity of the labeled samples for training machine learning. To tackle these challenges, we present a bioacoustic signal classifier equipped with a discriminative mechanism to extract useful features for analysis and classification efficiently. The proposed classifier does not require a large amount of training data and handles nonuniform signal length natively. Unlike current bioacoustic recognition methods, which are task-oriented, the proposed model relies on transforming the input signals into vector subspaces generated by applying Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Then, a subspace is designed to expose discriminative features. The proposed model shares end-to-end capabilities, which is desirable in modern machine learning systems. This formulation provides a segmentation-free and noise-tolerant approach to represent and classify bioacoustic signals and a highly compact signal descriptor inherited from SSA. The validity of the proposed method is verified using three challenging bioacoustic datasets containing anuran, bee, and mosquito species. Experimental results on three bioacoustic datasets have shown the competitive performance of the proposed method compared to commonly employed methods for bioacoustics signal classification in terms of accuracy.

**Abstract:** While pretrained language models ("LM") have driven impressive gains over morpho-syntactic and semantic tasks, their ability to model discourse and pragmatic phenomena is less clear. As a step towards a better understanding of their discourse modelling capabilities, we propose a sentence intrusion detection task. We examine the performance of a broad range of pretrained LMs on this detection task for English. Lacking a dataset for the task, we introduce INSteD, a novel intruder sentence detection dataset, containing 170,000+ documents constructed from English Wikipedia and CNN news articles. Our experiments show that pretrained LMs perform impressively in in-domain evaluation, but experience a substantial drop in the cross-domain setting, indicating limited generalisation capacity. Further results over a novel linguistic probe dataset show that there is substantial room for improvement, especially in the cross-domain setting.

**Abstract:** Nowadays online users prefer to join multiple social media for the purpose of socialized online service. The problem \textit{anchor link prediction} is formalized to link user data with the common ground on user profile, content and network structure across social networks. Most of the traditional works concentrated on learning matching function with explicit or implicit features on observed user data. However, the low quality of observed user data confuses the judgment on anchor links, resulting in the matching collision problem in practice. In this paper, we explore local structure consistency and then construct a matching graph in order to circumvent matching collisions. Furthermore, we propose graph convolution networks with mini-batch strategy, efficiently solving anchor link prediction on matching graph. The experimental results on three real application scenarios show the great potentials of our proposed method in both prediction accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the visualization of learned embeddings provides us a qualitative way to understand the inference of anchor links on the matching graph.

**Abstract:** Standard frame-based cameras that sample light intensity frames are heavily impacted by motion blur for high-speed motion and fail to perceive scene accurately when the dynamic range is high. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, overcome these limitations by asynchronously detecting the variation in individual pixel intensities. However, event cameras only provide information about pixels in motion, leading to sparse data. Hence, estimating the overall dense behavior of pixels is difficult. To address such issues associated with the sensors, we present Fusion-FlowNet, a sensor fusion framework for energy-efficient optical flow estimation using both frame- and event-based sensors, leveraging their complementary characteristics. Our proposed network architecture is also a fusion of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) where each network is designed to simultaneously process asynchronous event streams and regular frame-based images, respectively. Our network is end-to-end trained using unsupervised learning to avoid expensive video annotations. The method generalizes well across distinct environments (rapid motion and challenging lighting conditions) and demonstrates state-of-the-art optical flow prediction on the Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC) dataset. Furthermore, our network offers substantial savings in terms of the number of network parameters and computational energy cost.

**Abstract:** We consider a novel data driven approach for designing learning algorithms that can effectively learn with only a small number of labeled examples. This is crucial for modern machine learning applications where labels are scarce or expensive to obtain. We focus on graph-based techniques, where the unlabeled examples are connected in a graph under the implicit assumption that similar nodes likely have similar labels. Over the past decades, several elegant graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms for how to infer the labels of the unlabeled examples given the graph and a few labeled examples have been proposed. However, the problem of how to create the graph (which impacts the practical usefulness of these methods significantly) has been relegated to domain-specific art and heuristics and no general principles have been proposed. In this work we present a novel data driven approach for learning the graph and provide strong formal guarantees in both the distributional and online learning formalizations.
  We show how to leverage problem instances coming from an underlying problem domain to learn the graph hyperparameters from commonly used parametric families of graphs that perform well on new instances coming from the same domain. We obtain low regret and efficient algorithms in the online setting, and generalization guarantees in the distributional setting. We also show how to combine several very different similarity metrics and learn multiple hyperparameters, providing general techniques to apply to large classes of problems. We expect some of the tools and techniques we develop along the way to be of interest beyond semi-supervised learning, for data driven algorithms for combinatorial problems more generally.

**Abstract:** Many neuroscientific applications require robust and accurate localization of neurons. It is still an unsolved problem because of the enormous variation in intensity, texture, spatial overlap, morphology and background artifacts. In addition, curation of a large dataset containing complete manual annotation of neurons from high-resolution images to train a classifier requires significant time and effort. We present Cellcounter, a deep learning-based model trained on images containing incompletely-annotated neurons with highly-varied morphology and control images containing artifacts and background structures. Leveraging the striking self-learning ability, Cellcounter gradually labels neurons, obviating the need for time-intensive complete annotation. Cellcounter shows its efficacy over the state of the arts in the accurate localization of neurons while significantly reducing false-positive detection in several protocols.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) using GroupSort neural networks as discriminators. We show that the error bound for the approximation of target distribution depends on both the width/depth (capacity) of generators and discriminators, as well as the number of samples in training. A quantified generalization bound is established for Wasserstein distance between the generated distribution and the target distribution. According to our theoretical results, WGANs have higher requirement for the capacity of discriminators than that of generators, which is consistent with some existing theories. More importantly, overly deep and wide (high capacity) generators may cause worse results (after training) than low capacity generators if discriminators are not strong enough. Numerical results on the synthetic data (swiss roll) and MNIST data confirm our theoretical results, and demonstrate that the performance by using GroupSort neural networks as discriminators is better than that of the original WGAN.

**Abstract:** Federated learning has emerged as a popular technique for distributing machine learning (ML) model training across the wireless edge. In this paper, we propose two timescale hybrid federated learning (TT-HF), a semi-decentralized learning architecture that combines the conventional device-to-server communication paradigm for federated learning with device-to-device (D2D) communications for model training. In TT-HF, during each global aggregation interval, devices (i) perform multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on their individual datasets, and (ii) aperiodically engage in consensus procedure of their model parameters through cooperative, distributed D2D communications within local clusters. With a new general definition of gradient diversity, we formally study the convergence behavior of TT-HF, resulting in new convergence bounds for distributed ML. We leverage our convergence bounds to develop an adaptive control algorithm that tunes the step size, D2D communication rounds, and global aggregation period of TT-HF over time to target a sublinear convergence rate of O(1/t) while minimizing network resource utilization. Our subsequent experiments demonstrate that TT-HF significantly outperforms the current art in federated learning in terms of model accuracy and/or network energy consumption in different scenarios where local device datasets exhibit statistical heterogeneity. Finally, our numerical evaluations demonstrate robustness against outages caused by fading channels, as well favorable performance with non-convex loss functions.

**Abstract:** Generating 3D dances from music is an emerged research task that benefits a lot of applications in vision and graphics. Previous works treat this task as sequence generation, however, it is challenging to render a music-aligned long-term sequence with high kinematic complexity and coherent movements. In this paper, we reformulate it by a two-stage process, ie, a key pose generation and then an in-between parametric motion curve prediction, where the key poses are easier to be synchronized with the music beats and the parametric curves can be efficiently regressed to render fluent rhythm-aligned movements. We named the proposed method as DanceFormer, which includes two cascading kinematics-enhanced transformer-guided networks (called DanTrans) that tackle each stage, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale music conditioned 3D dance dataset, called PhantomDance, that is accurately labeled by experienced animators rather than reconstruction or motion capture. This dataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart from pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, even trained by existing datasets, can generate fluent, performative, and music-matched 3D dances that surpass previous works quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, the proposed DanceFormer, together with the PhantomDance dataset, are seamlessly compatible with industrial animation software, thus facilitating the adaptation for various downstream applications.

**Abstract:** In this work, we develop an optimal transport (OT) based framework to select informative prototypical examples that best represent a given target dataset. Summarizing a given target dataset via representative examples is an important problem in several machine learning applications where human understanding of the learning models and underlying data distribution is essential for decision making. We model the prototype selection problem as learning a sparse (empirical) probability distribution having the minimum OT distance from the target distribution. The learned probability measure supported on the chosen prototypes directly corresponds to their importance in representing the target data. We show that our objective function enjoys a key property of submodularity and propose an efficient greedy method that is both computationally fast and possess deterministic approximation guarantees. Empirical results on several real world benchmarks illustrate the efficacy of our approach.
