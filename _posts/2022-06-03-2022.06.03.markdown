**Abstract:** Several deep neural networks have recently been shown to generate activations similar to those of the brain in response to the same input. These algorithms, however, remain largely implausible: they require (1) extraordinarily large amounts of data, (2) unobtainable supervised labels, (3) textual rather than raw sensory input, and / or (4) implausibly large memory (e.g. thousands of contextual words). These elements highlight the need to identify algorithms that, under these limitations, would suffice to account for both behavioral and brain responses. Focusing on the issue of speech processing, we here hypothesize that self-supervised algorithms trained on the raw waveform constitute a promising candidate. Specifically, we compare a recent self-supervised architecture, Wav2Vec 2.0, to the brain activity of 412 English, French, and Mandarin individuals recorded with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while they listened to ~1h of audio books. Our results are four-fold. First, we show that this algorithm learns brain-like representations with as little as 600 hours of unlabelled speech -- a quantity comparable to what infants can be exposed to during language acquisition. Second, its functional hierarchy aligns with the cortical hierarchy of speech processing. Third, different training regimes reveal a functional specialization akin to the cortex: Wav2Vec 2.0 learns sound-generic, speech-specific and language-specific representations similar to those of the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Fourth, we confirm the similarity of this specialization with the behavior of 386 additional participants. These elements, resulting from the largest neuroimaging benchmark to date, show how self-supervised learning can account for a rich organization of speech processing in the brain, and thus delineate a path to identify the laws of language acquisition which shape the human brain.

**Abstract:** Large text-guided diffusion models, such as DALLE-2, are able to generate stunning photorealistic images given natural language descriptions. While such models are highly flexible, they struggle to understand the composition of certain concepts, such as confusing the attributes of different objects or relations between objects. In this paper, we propose an alternative structured approach for compositional generation using diffusion models. An image is generated by composing a set of diffusion models, with each of them modeling a certain component of the image. To do this, we interpret diffusion models as energy-based models in which the data distributions defined by the energy functions may be explicitly combined. The proposed method can generate scenes at test time that are substantially more complex than those seen in training, composing sentence descriptions, object relations, human facial attributes, and even generalizing to new combinations that are rarely seen in the real world. We further illustrate how our approach may be used to compose pre-trained text-guided diffusion models and generate photorealistic images containing all the details described in the input descriptions, including the binding of certain object attributes that have been shown difficult for DALLE-2. These results point to the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting structured generalization for visual generation.

**Abstract:** Learning tabula rasa, that is without any prior knowledge, is the prevalent workflow in reinforcement learning (RL) research. However, RL systems, when applied to large-scale settings, rarely operate tabula rasa. Such large-scale systems undergo multiple design or algorithmic changes during their development cycle and use ad hoc approaches for incorporating these changes without re-training from scratch, which would have been prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the inefficiency of deep RL typically excludes researchers without access to industrial-scale resources from tackling computationally-demanding problems. To address these issues, we present reincarnating RL as an alternative workflow, where prior computational work (e.g., learned policies) is reused or transferred between design iterations of an RL agent, or from one RL agent to another. As a step towards enabling reincarnating RL from any agent to any other agent, we focus on the specific setting of efficiently transferring an existing sub-optimal policy to a standalone value-based RL agent. We find that existing approaches fail in this setting and propose a simple algorithm to address their limitations. Equipped with this algorithm, we demonstrate reincarnating RL's gains over tabula rasa RL on Atari 2600 games, a challenging locomotion task, and the real-world problem of navigating stratospheric balloons. Overall, this work argues for an alternative approach to RL research, which we believe could significantly improve real-world RL adoption and help democratize it further.

<p>

**Abstract:** What makes a video task uniquely suited for videos, beyond what can be understood from a single image? Building on recent progress in self-supervised image-language models, we revisit this question in the context of video and language tasks. We propose the atemporal probe (ATP), a new model for video-language analysis which provides a stronger bound on the baseline accuracy of multimodal models constrained by image-level understanding. By applying this model to standard discriminative video and language tasks, such as video question answering and text-to-video retrieval, we characterize the limitations and potential of current video-language benchmarks. We find that understanding of event temporality is often not necessary to achieve strong or state-of-the-art performance, even compared with recent large-scale video-language models and in contexts intended to benchmark deeper video-level understanding. We also demonstrate how ATP can improve both video-language dataset and model design. We describe a technique for leveraging ATP to better disentangle dataset subsets with a higher concentration of temporally challenging data, improving benchmarking efficacy for causal and temporal understanding. Further, we show that effectively integrating ATP into full video-level temporal models can improve efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

<p>

**Abstract:** It is a long-standing problem to find effective representations for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This paper demonstrates that learning state representations with supervision from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) can improve the performance of RL compared to other learned representations or even low-dimensional, hand-engineered state information. Specifically, we propose to train an encoder that maps multiple image observations to a latent space describing the objects in the scene. The decoder built from a latent-conditioned NeRF serves as the supervision signal to learn the latent space. An RL algorithm then operates on the learned latent space as its state representation. We call this NeRF-RL. Our experiments indicate that NeRF as supervision leads to a latent space better suited for the downstream RL tasks involving robotic object manipulations like hanging mugs on hooks, pushing objects, or opening doors.

<p>

**Abstract:** Machine maintenance is a challenging operational problem, where the goal is to plan sufficient preventive maintenance to avoid machine failures and overhauls. Maintenance is often imperfect in reality and does not make the asset as good as new. Although a variety of imperfect maintenance policies have been proposed in the literature, these rely on strong assumptions regarding the effect of maintenance on the machine's condition, assuming the effect is (1) deterministic or governed by a known probability distribution, and (2) machine-independent. This work proposes to relax both assumptions by learning the effect of maintenance conditional on a machine's characteristics from observational data on similar machines using existing methodologies for causal inference. By predicting the maintenance effect, we can estimate the number of overhauls and failures for different levels of maintenance and, consequently, optimize the preventive maintenance frequency to minimize the total estimated cost. We validate our proposed approach using real-life data on more than 4,000 maintenance contracts from an industrial partner. Empirical results show that our novel, causal approach accurately predicts the maintenance effect and results in individualized maintenance schedules that are more accurate and cost-effective than supervised or non-individualized approaches.

**Abstract:** Does the grammatical gender of a language interfere when measuring the semantic gender information captured by its word embeddings? A number of anomalous gender bias measurements in the embeddings of gendered languages suggest this possibility. We demonstrate that word embeddings learn the association between a noun and its grammatical gender in grammatically gendered languages, which can skew social gender bias measurements. Consequently, word embedding post-processing methods are introduced to quantify, disentangle, and evaluate grammatical gender signals. The evaluation is performed on five gendered languages from the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic branches of the Indo-European language family. Our method reduces the strength of grammatical gender signals, which is measured in terms of effect size (Cohen's d), by a significant average of d = 1.3 for French, German, and Italian, and d = 0.56 for Polish and Spanish. Once grammatical gender is disentangled, the association between over 90% of 10,000 inanimate nouns and their assigned grammatical gender weakens, and cross-lingual bias results from the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) become more congruent with country-level implicit bias measurements. The results further suggest that disentangling grammatical gender signals from word embeddings may lead to improvement in semantic machine learning tasks.

<p>

**Abstract:** Video-Language Pretraining (VLP), aiming to learn transferable representation to advance a wide range of video-text downstream tasks, has recently received increasing attention. Dominant works that achieve strong performance rely on large-scale, 3rd-person video-text datasets, such as HowTo100M. In this work, we exploit the recently released Ego4D dataset to pioneer Egocentric VLP along three directions. (i) We create EgoClip, a 1st-person video-text pretraining dataset comprising 3.8M clip-text pairs well-chosen from Ego4D, covering a large variety of human daily activities. (ii) We propose a novel pretraining objective, dubbed as EgoNCE, which adapts video-text contrastive learning to egocentric domain by mining egocentric-aware positive and negative samples. (iii) We introduce EgoMCQ, a development benchmark that is close to EgoClip and hence can support effective validation and fast exploration of our design decisions regarding EgoClip and EgoNCE. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance on five egocentric downstream tasks across three datasets: video-text retrieval on EPIC-KITCHENS-100; action recognition on Charades-Ego; and natural language query, moment query, and object state change classification on Ego4D challenge benchmarks. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/showlab/EgoVLP.

<p>

**Abstract:** While data are the primary fuel for machine learning models, they often suffer from missing values, especially when collected in real-world scenarios. However, many off-the-shelf machine learning models, including artificial neural network models, are unable to handle these missing values directly. Therefore, extra data preprocessing and curation steps, such as data imputation, are inevitable before learning and prediction processes. In this study, we propose a simple and intuitive yet effective method for pruning missing values (PROMISSING) during learning and inference steps in neural networks. In this method, there is no need to remove or impute the missing values; instead, the missing values are treated as a new source of information (representing what we do not know). Our experiments on simulated data, several classification and regression benchmarks, and a multi-modal clinical dataset show that PROMISSING results in similar prediction performance compared to various imputation techniques. In addition, our experiments show models trained using PROMISSING techniques are becoming less decisive in their predictions when facing incomplete samples with many unknowns. This finding hopefully advances machine learning models from being pure predicting machines to more realistic thinkers that can also say "I do not know" when facing incomplete sources of information.

**Abstract:** Customer reviews are vital for making purchasing decisions in the Information Age. Such reviews can be automatically summarized to provide the user with an overview of opinions. In this tutorial, we present various aspects of opinion summarization that are useful for researchers and practitioners. First, we will introduce the task and major challenges. Then, we will present existing opinion summarization solutions, both pre-neural and neural. We will discuss how summarizers can be trained in the unsupervised, few-shot, and supervised regimes. Each regime has roots in different machine learning methods, such as auto-encoding, controllable text generation, and variational inference. Finally, we will discuss resources and evaluation methods and conclude with the future directions. This three-hour tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview over major advances in opinion summarization. The listeners will be well-equipped with the knowledge that is both useful for research and practical applications.

**Abstract:** This paper discovers that the neural network with lower decision boundary (DB) variability has better generalizability. Two new notions, algorithm DB variability and $(Œµ, Œ∑)$-data DB variability, are proposed to measure the decision boundary variability from the algorithm and data perspectives. Extensive experiments show significant negative correlations between the decision boundary variability and the generalizability. From the theoretical view, two lower bounds based on algorithm DB variability are proposed and do not explicitly depend on the sample size. We also prove an upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}}+Œµ+Œ∑\log\frac{1}Œ∑\right)$ based on data DB variability. The bound is convenient to estimate without the requirement of labels, and does not explicitly depend on the network size which is usually prohibitively large in deep learning.

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the representation space of contextualized embeddings and gain insight into the hidden topology of large language models. We show there exists a network of latent states that summarize linguistic properties of contextualized representations. Instead of seeking alignments to existing well-defined annotations, we infer this latent network in a fully unsupervised way using a structured variational autoencoder. The induced states not only serve as anchors that mark the topology (neighbors and connectivity) of the representation manifold but also reveal the internal mechanism of encoding sentences. With the induced network, we: (1). decompose the representation space into a spectrum of latent states which encode fine-grained word meanings with lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic information; (2). show state-state transitions encode rich phrase constructions and serve as the backbones of the latent space. Putting the two together, we show that sentences are represented as a traversal over the latent network where state-state transition chains encode syntactic templates and state-word emissions fill in the content. We demonstrate these insights with extensive experiments and visualizations.

**Abstract:** Conventional methods for causal structure learning from data face significant challenges due to combinatorial search space. Recently, the problem has been formulated into a continuous optimization framework with an acyclicity constraint to learn Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Such a framework allows the utilization of deep generative models for causal structure learning to better capture the relations between data sample distributions and DAGs. However, so far no study has experimented with the use of Wasserstein distance in the context of causal structure learning. Our model named DAG-WGAN combines the Wasserstein-based adversarial loss with an acyclicity constraint in an auto-encoder architecture. It simultaneously learns causal structures while improving its data generation capability. We compare the performance of DAG-WGAN with other models that do not involve the Wasserstein metric in order to identify its contribution to causal structure learning. Our model performs better with high cardinality data according to our experiments.

**Abstract:** Model-based methods have recently shown promising for offline reinforcement learning (RL), aiming to learn good policies from historical data without interacting with the environment. Previous model-based offline RL methods learn fully connected nets as world-models that map the states and actions to the next-step states. However, it is sensible that a world-model should adhere to the underlying causal effect such that it will support learning an effective policy generalizing well in unseen states. In this paper, We first provide theoretical results that causal world-models can outperform plain world-models for offline RL by incorporating the causal structure into the generalization error bound. We then propose a practical algorithm, oFfline mOdel-based reinforcement learning with CaUsal Structure (FOCUS), to illustrate the feasibility of learning and leveraging causal structure in offline RL. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that FOCUS reconstructs the underlying causal structure accurately and robustly. Consequently, it performs better than the plain model-based offline RL algorithms and other causal model-based RL algorithms.

**Abstract:** Gradient based meta-learning methods are prone to overfit on the meta-training set, and this behaviour is more prominent with large and complex networks. Moreover, large networks restrict the application of meta-learning models on low-power edge devices. While choosing smaller networks avoid these issues to a certain extent, it affects the overall generalization leading to reduced performance. Clearly, there is an approximately optimal choice of network architecture that is best suited for every meta-learning problem, however, identifying it beforehand is not straightforward. In this paper, we present MetaDOCK, a task-specific dynamic kernel selection strategy for designing compressed CNN models that generalize well on unseen tasks in meta-learning. Our method is based on the hypothesis that for a given set of similar tasks, not all kernels of the network are needed by each individual task. Rather, each task uses only a fraction of the kernels, and the selection of the kernels per task can be learnt dynamically as a part of the inner update steps. MetaDOCK compresses the meta-model as well as the task-specific inner models, thus providing significant reduction in model size for each task, and through constraining the number of active kernels for every task, it implicitly mitigates the issue of meta-overfitting. We show that for the same inference budget, pruned versions of large CNN models obtained using our approach consistently outperform the conventional choices of CNN models. MetaDOCK couples well with popular meta-learning approaches such as iMAML. The efficacy of our method is validated on CIFAR-fs and mini-ImageNet datasets, and we have observed that our approach can provide improvements in model accuracy of up to 2% on standard meta-learning benchmark, while reducing the model size by more than 75%.

**Abstract:** Analyzing how humans revise their writings is an interesting research question, not only from an educational perspective but also in terms of artificial intelligence. Better understanding of this process could facilitate many NLP applications, from intelligent tutoring systems to supportive and collaborative writing environments. Developing these applications, however, requires revision corpora, which are not widely available. In this work, we present ArgRewrite V.2, a corpus of annotated argumentative revisions, collected from two cycles of revisions to argumentative essays about self-driving cars. Annotations are provided at different levels of purpose granularity (coarse and fine) and scope (sentential and subsentential). In addition, the corpus includes the revision goal given to each writer, essay scores, annotation verification, pre- and post-study surveys collected from participants as meta-data. The variety of revision unit scope and purpose granularity levels in ArgRewrite, along with the inclusion of new types of meta-data, can make it a useful resource for research and applications that involve revision analysis. We demonstrate some potential applications of ArgRewrite V.2 in the development of automatic revision purpose predictors, as a training source and benchmark.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained contextualized embedding models such as BERT are a standard building block in many natural language processing systems. We demonstrate that the sentence-level representations produced by some off-the-shelf contextualized embedding models have a narrow distribution in the embedding space, and thus perform poorly for the task of identifying semantically similar questions in real-world English business conversations. We describe a method that uses appropriately tuned representations and a small set of exemplars to group questions of interest to business users in a visualization that can be used for data exploration or employee coaching.

**Abstract:** Conceptualization, or viewing entities and situations as instances of abstract concepts in mind and making inferences based on that, is a vital component in human intelligence for commonsense reasoning. Although recent artificial intelligence has made progress in acquiring and modelling commonsense, attributed to large neural language models and commonsense knowledge graphs (CKGs), conceptualization is yet to thoroughly be introduced, making current approaches ineffective to cover knowledge about countless diverse entities and situations in the real world. To address the problem, we thoroughly study the possible role of conceptualization in commonsense reasoning, and formulate a framework to replicate human conceptual induction from acquiring abstract knowledge about abstract concepts. Aided by the taxonomy Probase, we develop tools for contextualized conceptualization on ATOMIC, a large-scale human annotated CKG. We annotate a dataset for the validity of conceptualizations for ATOMIC on both event and triple level, develop a series of heuristic rules based on linguistic features, and train a set of neural models, so as to generate and verify abstract knowledge. Based on these components, a pipeline to acquire abstract knowledge is built. A large abstract CKG upon ATOMIC is then induced, ready to be instantiated to infer about unseen entities or situations. Furthermore, experiments find directly augmenting data with abstract triples to be helpful in commonsense modelling.

**Abstract:** Human-robot studies are expensive to conduct and difficult to control, and as such researchers sometimes turn to human-avatar interaction in the hope of faster and cheaper data collection that can be transferred to the robot domain. In terms of our work, we are particularly interested in the challenge of detecting and modelling user confusion in interaction, and as part of this research programme, we conducted situated dialogue studies to investigate users' reactions in confusing scenarios that we give in both physical and virtual environments. In this paper, we present a combined review of these studies and the results that we observed across these two embodiments. For the physical embodiment, we used a Pepper Robot, while for the virtual modality, we used a 3D avatar. Our study shows that despite attitudinal differences and technical control limitations, there were a number of similarities detected in user behaviour and self-reporting results across embodiment options. This work suggests that, while avatar interaction is no true substitute for robot interaction studies, sufficient care in study design may allow well executed human-avatar studies to supplement more challenging human-robot studies.

**Abstract:** Detecting 3D keypoints from point clouds is important for shape reconstruction, while this work investigates the dual question: can shape reconstruction benefit 3D keypoint detection? Existing methods either seek salient features according to statistics of different orders or learn to predict keypoints that are invariant to transformation. Nevertheless, the idea of incorporating shape reconstruction into 3D keypoint detection is under-explored. We argue that this is restricted by former problem formulations. To this end, a novel unsupervised paradigm named SNAKE is proposed, which is short for shape-aware neural 3D keypoint field. Similar to recent coordinate-based radiance or distance field, our network takes 3D coordinates as inputs and predicts implicit shape indicators and keypoint saliency simultaneously, thus naturally entangling 3D keypoint detection and shape reconstruction. We achieve superior performance on various public benchmarks, including standalone object datasets ModelNet40, KeypointNet, SMPL meshes and scene-level datasets 3DMatch and Redwood. Intrinsic shape awareness brings several advantages as follows. (1) SNAKE generates 3D keypoints consistent with human semantic annotation, even without such supervision. (2) SNAKE outperforms counterparts in terms of repeatability, especially when the input point clouds are down-sampled. (3) the generated keypoints allow accurate geometric registration, notably in a zero-shot setting. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhongcl-thu/SNAKE

**Abstract:** We describe an extension of the Fanoos XAI system [Bayani et al 2022] which enables the system to learn the appropriate action to take in order to satisfy a user's request for description to be made more or less abstract. Specifically, descriptions of systems under analysis are stored in states, and in order to make a description more or less abstract, Fanoos selects an operator from a large library to apply to the state and generate a new description. Prior work on Fanoos predominately used hand-written methods for operator-selection; this current work allows Fanoos to leverage experience to learn the best operator to apply in a particular situation, balancing exploration and exploitation, leveraging expert insights when available, and utilizing similarity between the current state and past states. Additionally, in order to bootstrap the learning process (i.e., like in curriculum learning), we describe a simulated user which we implemented; this simulation allows Fanoos to gain general insights that enable reasonable courses of action, insights which later can be refined by experience with real users, as opposed to interacting with humans completely from scratch. Code implementing the methods described in the paper can be found at https://github/DBay-ani/Operator_Selection_Learning_Extensions_For_Fanoos.

**Abstract:** Learning a dynamical system requires stabilizing the unknown dynamics to avoid state blow-ups. However, current reinforcement learning (RL) methods lack stabilization guarantees, which limits their applicability for the control of safety-critical systems. We propose a model-based RL framework with formal stability guarantees, Krasovskii Constrained RL (KCRL), that adopts Krasovskii's family of Lyapunov functions as a stability constraint. The proposed method learns the system dynamics up to a confidence interval using feature representation, e.g. Random Fourier Features. It then solves a constrained policy optimization problem with a stability constraint based on Krasovskii's method using a primal-dual approach to recover a stabilizing policy. We show that KCRL is guaranteed to learn a stabilizing policy in a finite number of interactions with the underlying unknown system. We also derive the sample complexity upper bound for stabilization of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems via the KCRL framework.

**Abstract:** Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) aims to train an unbiased ranking model from biased user click logs. Most of the current ULTR methods are based on the examination hypothesis (EH), which assumes that the click probability can be factorized into two scalar functions, one related to ranking features and the other related to bias factors. Unfortunately, the interactions among features, bias factors and clicks are complicated in practice, and usually cannot be factorized in this independent way. Fitting click data with EH could lead to model misspecification and bring the approximation error.
  In this paper, we propose a vector-based EH and formulate the click probability as a dot product of two vector functions. This solution is complete due to its universality in fitting arbitrary click functions. Based on it, we propose a novel model named Vectorization to adaptively learn the relevance embeddings and sort documents by projecting embeddings onto a base vector. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ULTR methods on complex real clicks as well as simple simulated clicks.

**Abstract:** Learning causal structures from observation and experimentation is a central task in many domains. For example, in biology, recent advances allow us to obtain single-cell expression data under multiple interventions such as drugs or gene knockouts. However, a key challenge is that often the targets of the interventions are uncertain or unknown. Thus, standard causal discovery methods can no longer be used. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework (BaCaDI) for discovering the causal structure that underlies data generated under various unknown experimental/interventional conditions. BaCaDI is fully differentiable and operates in the continuous space of latent probabilistic representations of both causal structures and interventions. This enables us to approximate complex posteriors via gradient-based variational inference and to reason about the epistemic uncertainty in the predicted structure. In experiments on synthetic causal discovery tasks and simulated gene-expression data, BaCaDI outperforms related methods in identifying causal structures and intervention targets. Finally, we demonstrate that, thanks to its rigorous Bayesian approach, our method provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

**Abstract:** Nowadays, the application of microgrids (MG) with renewable energy is becoming more and more extensive, which creates a strong need for dynamic energy management. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to learn an optimal policy for making joint energy dispatch (ED) and unit commitment (UC) decisions in an isolated MG, with the aim for reducing the total power generation cost on the premise of ensuring the supply-demand balance. In order to overcome the challenge of discrete-continuous hybrid action space due to joint ED and UC, we propose a DRL algorithm, i.e., the hybrid action finite-horizon DDPG (HAFH-DDPG), that seamlessly integrates two classical DRL algorithms, i.e., deep Q-network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), based on a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) framework. Moreover, a diesel generator (DG) selection strategy is presented to support a simplified action space for reducing the computation complexity of this algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is verified through comparison with several baseline algorithms by experiments with real-world data set.

**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks are a powerful model class for a range of computer vision problems, but it is difficult to interpret the image filtering process they implement, given their sheer size. In this work, we introduce a method for extracting 'feature-preserving circuits' from deep CNNs, leveraging methods from saliency-based neural network pruning. These circuits are modular sub-functions, embedded within the network, containing only a subset of convolutional kernels relevant to a target feature. We compare the efficacy of 3 saliency-criteria for extracting these sparse circuits. Further, we show how 'sub-feature' circuits can be extracted, that preserve a feature's responses to particular images, dividing the feature into even sparser filtering processes. We also develop a tool for visualizing 'circuit diagrams', which render the entire image filtering process implemented by circuits in a parsable format.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of conditional density estimation, which is a major topic of interest in the fields of statistical and machine learning. Our method, called Marginal Contrastive Discrimination, MCD, reformulates the conditional density function into two factors, the marginal density function of the target variable and a ratio of density functions which can be estimated through binary classification. Like noise-contrastive methods, MCD can leverage state-of-the-art supervised learning techniques to perform conditional density estimation, including neural networks. Our benchmark reveals that our method significantly outperforms in practice existing methods on most density models and regression datasets.

**Abstract:** We study decentralized policy learning in Markov games where we control a single agent to play with nonstationary and possibly adversarial opponents. Our goal is to develop a no-regret online learning algorithm that (i) takes actions based on the local information observed by the agent and (ii) is able to find the best policy in hindsight. For such a problem, the nonstationary state transitions due to the varying opponent pose a significant challenge. In light of a recent hardness result \citep{liu2022learning}, we focus on the setting where the opponent's previous policies are revealed to the agent for decision making. With such an information structure, we propose a new algorithm, \underline{D}ecentralized \underline{O}ptimistic hype\underline{R}policy m\underline{I}rror de\underline{S}cent (DORIS), which achieves $\sqrt{K}$-regret in the context of general function approximation, where $K$ is the number of episodes. Moreover, when all the agents adopt DORIS, we prove that their mixture policy constitutes an approximate coarse correlated equilibrium. In particular, DORIS maintains a \textit{hyperpolicy} which is a distribution over the policy space. The hyperpolicy is updated via mirror descent, where the update direction is obtained by an optimistic variant of least-squares policy evaluation. Furthermore, to illustrate the power of our method, we apply DORIS to constrained and vector-valued MDPs, which can be formulated as zero-sum Markov games with a fictitious opponent.

**Abstract:** In today's world, many patients with cognitive impairments and motor dysfunction seek the attention of experts to perform specific conventional therapies to improve their situation. However, due to a lack of neurorehabilitation professionals, patients suffer from severe effects that worsen their condition. In this paper, we present a technological approach for a novel robotic neurorehabilitation training system. It relies on a combination of a rehabilitation device, signal classification methods, supervised machine learning models for training adaptation, training exercises, and socially interactive agents as a user interface. Together with a professional, the system can be trained towards the patient's specific needs. Furthermore, after a training phase, patients are enabled to train independently at home without the assistance of a physical therapist with a socially interactive agent in the role of a coaching assistant.

**Abstract:** The classic algorithm AdaBoost allows to convert a weak learner, that is an algorithm that produces a hypothesis which is slightly better than chance, into a strong learner, achieving arbitrarily high accuracy when given enough training data. We present a new algorithm that constructs a strong learner from a weak learner but uses less training data than AdaBoost and all other weak to strong learners to achieve the same generalization bounds. A sample complexity lower bound shows that our new algorithm uses the minimum possible amount of training data and is thus optimal. Hence, this work settles the sample complexity of the classic problem of constructing a strong learner from a weak learner.

**Abstract:** Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a principled way to include prior physical knowledge in form of partial differential equations (PDEs) into neural networks. Although generally viewed as being mesh-free, current approaches still rely on collocation points obtained within a bounded region, even in settings with spatially sparse signals. Furthermore, if the boundaries are not known, the selection of such a region may be arbitrary, resulting in a large proportion of collocation points being selected in areas of low relevance. To resolve this, we present a mesh-free and adaptive approach termed particle-density PINN (pdPINN), which is inspired by the microscopic viewpoint of fluid dynamics. Instead of sampling from a bounded region, we propose to sample directly from the distribution over the (fluids) particle positions, eliminating the need to introduce boundaries while adaptively focusing on the most relevant regions. This is achieved by reformulating the modeled fluid density as an unnormalized probability distribution from which we sample with dynamic Monte Carlo methods. We further generalize pdPINNs to different settings that allow interpreting a positive scalar quantity as a particle density, such as the evolution of the temperature in the heat equation. The utility of our approach is demonstrated on experiments for modeling (non-steady) compressible fluids in up to three dimensions and a two-dimensional diffusion problem, illustrating the high flexibility and sample efficiency compared to existing refinement methods for PINNs.

**Abstract:** Graph contrastive learning (GCL) alleviates the heavy reliance on label information for graph representation learning (GRL) via self-supervised learning schemes. The core idea is to learn by maximising mutual information for similar instances, which requires similarity computation between two node instances. However, this operation can be computationally expensive. For example, the time complexity of two commonly adopted contrastive loss functions (i.e., InfoNCE and JSD estimator) for a node is $O(ND)$ and $O(D)$, respectively, where $N$ is the number of nodes, and $D$ is the embedding dimension. Additionally, GCL normally requires a large number of training epochs to be well-trained on large-scale datasets. Inspired by an observation of a technical defect (i.e., inappropriate usage of Sigmoid function) commonly used in two representative GCL works, DGI and MVGRL, we revisit GCL and introduce a new learning paradigm for self-supervised GRL, namely, Group Discrimination (GD), and propose a novel GD-based method called Graph Group Discrimination (GGD). Instead of similarity computation, GGD directly discriminates two groups of summarised node instances with a simple binary cross-entropy loss. As such, GGD only requires $O(1)$ for loss computation of a node. In addition, GGD requires much fewer training epochs to obtain competitive performance compared with GCL methods on large-scale datasets. These two advantages endow GGD with the very efficient property. Extensive experiments show that GGD outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on 8 datasets. In particular, GGD can be trained in 0.18 seconds (6.44 seconds including data preprocessing) on ogbn-arxiv, which is orders of magnitude (10,000+ faster than GCL baselines} while consuming much less memory. Trained with 9 hours on ogbn-papers100M with billion edges, GGD outperforms its GCL counterparts in both accuracy and efficiency.

**Abstract:** There are many challenges in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to autonomous driving in a structured environment such as an urban area. This is because the massive traffic flows moving along the road network change dynamically. It is a key factor to detect changes in the intentions of surrounding vehicles and quickly find a response strategy. In this paper, we suggest a new framework that effectively combines graph-based intention representation learning and reinforcement learning for kinodynamic planning. Specifically, the movement of dynamic agents is expressed as a graph. The spatio-temporal locality of node features is conserved and the features are aggregated by considering the interaction between adjacent nodes. We simultaneously learn motion planner and controller that share the aggregated information via a safe RL framework. We intuitively interpret a given situation with predicted trajectories to generate additional cost signals. The dense cost signals encourage the policy to be safe for dynamic risk. Moreover, by utilizing the data obtained through the direct rollout of learned policy, robust intention inference is achieved for various situations encountered in training. We set up a navigation scenario in which various situations exist by using CARLA, an urban driving simulator. The experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our approach compared to the existing baselines.

Transfer-based adversarial images are generated on one (source) system and used to attack another (target) system. In this paper, we take the first step to investigate transfer-based targeted adversarial images in a realistic scenario where the target system is trained on some private data with its inventory of semantic labels not publicly available. Our main contributions include an extensive human-judgment-based evaluation of attack success on the Google Cloud Vision API and additional analysis of the different behaviors of Google Cloud Vision in face of original images vs. adversarial images.

**Abstract:** We exploit field guides to learn bird species recognition, in particular zero-shot recognition of unseen species. The illustrations contained in field guides deliberately focus on discriminative properties of a species, and can serve as side information to transfer knowledge from seen to unseen classes. We study two approaches: (1) a contrastive encoding of illustrations that can be fed into zero-shot learning schemes; and (2) a novel method that leverages the fact that illustrations are also images and as such structurally more similar to photographs than other kinds of side information. Our results show that illustrations from field guides, which are readily available for a wide range of species, are indeed a competitive source of side information. On the iNaturalist2021 subset, we obtain a harmonic mean from 749 seen and 739 unseen classes greater than $45\%$ (@top-10) and $15\%$ (@top-1). Which shows that field guides are a valuable option for challenging real-world scenarios with many species.

**Abstract:** Traditional models of active learning assume a learner can directly manipulate or query a covariate $X$ in order to study its relationship with a response $Y$. However, if $X$ is a feature of a complex system, it may be possible only to indirectly influence $X$ by manipulating a control variable $Z$, a scenario we refer to as Indirect Active Learning. Under a nonparametric model of Indirect Active Learning with a fixed budget, we study minimax convergence rates for estimating the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ locally at a point, obtaining different rates depending on the complexities and noise levels of the relationships between $Z$ and $X$ and between $X$ and $Y$. We also identify minimax rates for passive learning under comparable assumptions. In many cases, our results show that, while there is an asymptotic benefit to active learning, this benefit is fully realized by a simple two-stage learner that runs two passive experiments in sequence.

Our approach is based on a careful design of non-convex lower confidence bounds for the online costs, and uses a novel technique for computationally-efficient regret minimization of these bounds that leverages their particular non-convex structure.

**Abstract:** This paper is concerned with learning transferable contact models for aerial manipulation tasks. We investigate a contact-based approach for enabling unmanned aerial vehicles with cable-suspended passive grippers to compute the attach points on novel payloads for aerial transportation. This is the first time that the problem of autonomously generating contact points for such tasks has been investigated. Our approach builds on the underpinning idea that we can learn a probability density of contacts over objects' surfaces from a single demonstration. We enhance this formulation for encoding aerial transportation tasks while maintaining the one-shot learning paradigm without handcrafting task-dependent features or employing ad-hoc heuristics; the only prior is extrapolated directly from a single demonstration. Our models only rely on the geometrical properties of the payloads computed from a point cloud, and they are robust to partial views. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated in simulation, in which one or three quadropters are requested to transport previously unseen payloads along a desired trajectory. The contact points and the quadroptors configurations are computed on-the-fly for each test by our apporach and compared with a baseline method, a modified grasp learning algorithm from the literature. Empirical experiments show that the contacts generated by our approach yield a better controllability of the payload for a transportation task. We conclude this paper with a discussion on the strengths and limitations of the presented idea, and our suggested future research directions.

**Abstract:** Educational technologies nowadays increasingly use data and Machine Learning (ML) models. This gives the students, instructors, and administrators support and insights for the optimum policy. However, it is well acknowledged that ML models are subject to bias, which raises concern about the fairness, bias, and discrimination of using these automated ML algorithms in education and its unintended and unforeseen negative consequences. The contribution of bias during the decision-making comes from datasets used for training ML models and the model architecture. This paper presents a preliminary investigation of fairness constraint in transformer neural networks on Law School and Student-Mathematics datasets. The used transformer models transform these raw datasets into a richer representation space of natural language processing (NLP) while solving fairness classification. We have employed fairness metrics for evaluation and check the trade-off between fairness and accuracy. We have reported the various metrics of F1, SPD, EOD, and accuracy for different architectures from the transformer model class.

**Abstract:** We systematically describe the problem of simultaneous surrogate modeling of mixed variables (i.e., continuous, integer and categorical variables) in the Bayesian optimization (BO) context. We provide a unified hybrid model using both Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and Gaussian processes (GP) that encompasses and generalizes multiple state-of-the-art mixed BO surrogates. Based on the architecture, we propose applying a new dynamic model selection criterion among novel candidate families of covariance kernels, including non-stationary kernels and associated families. Different benchmark problems are studied and presented to support the superiority of our model, along with results highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to most state-of-the-art mixed-variable methods in BO.

**Abstract:** When applying transfer learning for medical image analysis, downstream tasks often have significant gaps with the pre-training tasks. Previous methods mainly focus on improving the transferabilities of the pre-trained models to bridge the gaps. In fact, model fine-tuning can also play a very important role in tackling this problem. A conventional fine-tuning method is updating all deep neural networks (DNNs) layers by a single learning rate (LR), which ignores the unique transferabilities of different layers. In this work, we explore the behaviors of different layers in the fine-tuning stage. More precisely, we first hypothesize that lower-level layers are more domain-specific while higher-level layers are more task-specific, which is verified by a simple bi-directional fine-tuning scheme. It is harder for the pre-trained specific layers to transfer to new tasks than general layers. On this basis, to make different layers better co-adapt to the downstream tasks according to their transferabilities, a meta-learning-based LR learner, namely MetaLR, is proposed to assign LRs for each layer automatically. Extensive experiments on various medical applications (i.e., POCUS, BUSI, Chest X-ray, and LiTS) well confirm our hypothesis and show the superior performance of the proposed methods to previous state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods.

**Abstract:** Via an overparameterized linear model with Gaussian features, we provide conditions for good generalization for multiclass classification of minimum-norm interpolating solutions in an asymptotic setting where both the number of underlying features and the number of classes scale with the number of training points. The survival/contamination analysis framework for understanding the behavior of overparameterized learning problems is adapted to this setting, revealing that multiclass classification qualitatively behaves like binary classification in that, as long as there are not too many classes (made precise in the paper), it is possible to generalize well even in some settings where the corresponding regression tasks would not generalize. Besides various technical challenges, it turns out that the key difference from the binary classification setting is that there are relatively fewer positive training examples of each class in the multiclass setting as the number of classes increases, making the multiclass problem "harder" than the binary one.

**Abstract:** The problem of constrained Markov decision process is considered. An agent aims to maximize the expected accumulated discounted reward subject to multiple constraints on its costs (the number of constraints is relatively small). A new dual approach is proposed with the integration of two ingredients: entropy regularized policy optimizer and Vaidya's dual optimizer, both of which are critical to achieve faster convergence. The finite-time error bound of the proposed approach is provided. Despite the challenge of the nonconcave objective subject to nonconcave constraints, the proposed approach is shown to converge (with linear rate) to the global optimum. The complexity expressed in terms of the optimality gap and the constraint violation significantly improves upon the existing primal-dual approaches.

However, NAS is still laborious and time-consuming because a large number of performance estimations are required during the search process of NAS, and training DNNs is computationally intensive. To solve the major limitation of NAS, improving the efficiency of NAS is essential in the design of NAS. This paper begins with a brief introduction to the general framework of NAS. Then, the methods for evaluating network candidates under the proxy metrics are systematically discussed. This is followed by a description of surrogate-assisted NAS, which is divided into three different categories, namely Bayesian optimization for NAS, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for NAS, and MOP for NAS. Finally, remaining challenges and open research questions are discussed, and promising research topics are suggested in this emerging field.

**Abstract:** This study examines the utility of functional connectivity (FC) and graph-based (GB) measures with a support vector machine classifier for use in electroencephalogram (EEG) based biometrics. Although FC-based features have been used in biometric applications, studies assessing the identification algorithms on heterogeneous and large datasets are scarce. This work investigates the performance of FC and GB metrics on a dataset of 184 subjects formed by pooling three datasets recorded under different protocols and acquisition systems. The results demonstrate the higher discriminatory power of FC than GB metrics. The identification accuracy increases with higher frequency EEG bands, indicating the enhanced uniqueness of the neural signatures in beta and gamma bands. Using all the 56 EEG channels common to the three databases, the best identification accuracy of 97.4% is obtained using phase-locking value (PLV) based measures extracted from the gamma frequency band. Further, we investigate the effect of the length of the analysis epoch to determine the data acquisition time required to obtain satisfactory identification accuracy. When the number of channels is reduced to 21 from 56, there is a marginal reduction of 2.4% only in the identification accuracy using PLV features in the gamma band. Additional experiments have been conducted to study the effect of the cognitive state of the subject and mismatched train/test conditions on the performance of the system.

**Abstract:** Markov decision processes (MDP) and continuous-time MDP (CTMDP) are the fundamental models for non-deterministic systems with probabilistic uncertainty. Mean payoff (a.k.a. long-run average reward) is one of the most classic objectives considered in their context. We provide the first algorithm to compute mean payoff probably approximately correctly in unknown MDP; further, we extend it to unknown CTMDP. We do not require any knowledge of the state space, only a lower bound on the minimum transition probability, which has been advocated in literature. In addition to providing probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds for our algorithm, we also demonstrate its practical nature by running experiments on standard benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Providing non-trivial certificates of safety for non-linear stochastic systems is an important open problem that limits the wider adoption of autonomous systems in safety-critical applications. One promising solution to address this problem is barrier functions. The composition of a barrier function with a stochastic system forms a supermartingale, thus enabling the computation of the probability that the system stays in a safe set over a finite time horizon via martingale inequalities. However, existing approaches to find barrier functions for stochastic systems generally rely on convex optimization programs that restrict the search of a barrier to a small class of functions such as low degree SoS polynomials and can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we parameterize a barrier function as a neural network and show that techniques for robust training of neural networks can be successfully employed to find neural barrier functions. Specifically, we leverage bound propagation techniques to certify that a neural network satisfies the conditions to be a barrier function via linear programming and then employ the resulting bounds at training time to enforce the satisfaction of these conditions. We also present a branch-and-bound scheme that makes the certification framework scalable. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods in several case studies and often returns certificates of safety that are orders of magnitude larger.

**Abstract:** Lensless imaging seeks to replace/remove the lens in a conventional imaging system. The earliest cameras were in fact lensless, relying on long exposure times to form images on the other end of a small aperture in a darkened room/container (camera obscura). The introduction of a lens allowed for more light throughput and therefore shorter exposure times, while retaining sharp focus. The incorporation of digital sensors readily enabled the use of computational imaging techniques to post-process and enhance raw images (e.g. via deblurring, inpainting, denoising, sharpening). Recently, imaging scientists have started leveraging computational imaging as an integral part of lensless imaging systems, allowing them to form viewable images from the highly multiplexed raw measurements of lensless cameras (see [5] and references therein for a comprehensive treatment of lensless imaging). This represents a real paradigm shift in camera system design as there is more flexibility to cater the hardware to the application at hand (e.g. lightweight or flat designs). This increased flexibility comes however at the price of a more demanding post-processing of the raw digital recordings and a tighter integration of sensing and computation, often difficult to achieve in practice due to inefficient interactions between the various communities of scientists involved. With LenslessPiCam, we provide an easily accessible hardware and software framework to enable researchers, hobbyists, and students to implement and explore practical and computational aspects of lensless imaging. We also provide detailed guides and exercises so that LenslessPiCam can be used as an educational resource, and point to results from our graduate-level signal processing course.

**Abstract:** Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) reconstructs a super-resolved image from multiple raw images; hence, acquisition speed is limited, making it unsuitable for dynamic scenes. We propose a new method, Speckle Flow SIM, that models sample motion during the data capture in order to reconstruct dynamic scenes with super-resolution. Speckle Flow SIM uses fixed speckle illumination and relies on sample motion to capture a sequence of raw images. Then, the spatio-temporal relationship of the dynamic scene is modeled using a neural space-time model with coordinate-based multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and the motion dynamics and the super-resolved scene are jointly recovered. We validated Speckle Flow SIM in simulation and built a simple, inexpensive experimental setup with off-the-shelf components. We demonstrated that Speckle Flow SIM can reconstruct a dynamic scene with deformable motion and 1.88x the diffraction-limited resolution in experiment.

**Abstract:** Entrainment of movement to a periodic stimulus is a characteristic intelligent behaviour in humans and an important goal for adaptive robotics. We demonstrate a quadruped central pattern generator (CPG), consisting of modified Matsuoka neurons, that spontaneously adjusts its period of oscillation to that of a periodic input signal. This is done by simple forcing, with the aid of a filtering network as well as a neural model with tonic input-dependent oscillation period. We first use the NSGA3 algorithm to evolve the CPG parameters, using separate fitness functions for period tunability, limb homogeneity and gait stability. Four CPGs, maximizing different weighted averages of the fitness functions, are then selected from the Pareto front and each is used as a basis for optimizing a filter network. Different numbers of neurons are tested for each filter network. We find that period tunability in particular facilitates robust entrainment, that bounding gaits entrain more easily than walking gaits, and that more neurons in the filter network are beneficial for pre-processing input signals. The system that we present can be used in conjunction with sensory feedback to allow low-level adaptive and robust behaviour in walking robots.
