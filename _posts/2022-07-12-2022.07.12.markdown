**Abstract:** Recent works have shown how the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to domains beyond natural language processing, such as planning and interaction for robots. These embodied problems require an agent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of skills available, how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the world map back to the language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction. We find that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high-level instruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table top rearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment in the real world.

**Abstract:** In lifelong learning, an agent learns throughout its entire life without resets, in a constantly changing environment, as we humans do. Consequently, lifelong learning comes with a plethora of research problems such as continual domain shifts, which result in non-stationary rewards and environment dynamics. These non-stationarities are difficult to detect and cope with due to their continuous nature. Therefore, exploration strategies and learning methods are required that are capable of tracking the steady domain shifts, and adapting to them. We propose Reactive Exploration to track and react to continual domain shifts in lifelong reinforcement learning, and to update the policy correspondingly. To this end, we conduct experiments in order to investigate different exploration strategies. We empirically show that representatives of the policy-gradient family are better suited for lifelong learning, as they adapt more quickly to distribution shifts than Q-learning. Thereby, policy-gradient methods profit the most from Reactive Exploration and show good results in lifelong learning with continual domain shifts. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/reactive-exploration.

**Abstract:** Deep generative models are widely used for modelling high-dimensional time series, such as video animations, audio and climate data. Sequential variational autoencoders have been successfully considered for many applications, with many variant models relying on discrete-time methods and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). On the other hand, continuous-time methods have recently gained attraction, especially in the context of irregularly-sampled time series, where they can better handle the data than discrete-time methods. One such class are Gaussian process variational autoencoders (GPVAEs), where the VAE prior is set as a Gaussian process (GPs), allowing inductive biases to be explicitly encoded via the kernel function and interpretability of the latent space. However, a major limitation of GPVAEs is that it inherits the same cubic computational cost as GPs. In this work, we leverage the equivalent discrete state space representation of Markovian GPs to enable a linear-time GP solver via Kalman filtering and smoothing. We show via corrupt and missing frames tasks that our method performs favourably, especially on the latter where it outperforms RNN-based models.

**Abstract:** Recently, transformer and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks. However, how to effectively combine those operators to form high-performance hybrid visual architectures still remains a challenge. In this work, we study the learnable combination of convolution, transformer, and MLP by proposing a novel unified architecture search approach. Our approach contains two key designs to achieve the search for high-performance networks. First, we model the very different searchable operators in a unified form, and thus enable the operators to be characterized with the same set of configuration parameters. In this way, the overall search space size is significantly reduced, and the total search cost becomes affordable. Second, we propose context-aware downsampling modules (DSMs) to mitigate the gap between the different types of operators. Our proposed DSMs are able to better adapt features from different types of operators, which is important for identifying high-performance hybrid architectures. Finally, we integrate configurable operators and DSMs into a unified search space and search with a Reinforcement Learning-based search algorithm to fully explore the optimal combination of the operators. To this end, we search a baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, named UniNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets and Transformers. In particular, our UniNet-B5 achieves 84.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming EfficientNet-B7 and BoTNet-T7 with 44% and 55% fewer FLOPs respectively. By pretraining on the ImageNet-21K, our UniNet-B6 achieves 87.4%, outperforming Swin-L with 51% fewer FLOPs and 41% fewer parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/Sense-X/UniNet.

**Abstract:** We study Online Continual Learning with missing labels and propose SemiCon, a new contrastive loss designed for partly labeled data. We demonstrate its efficiency by devising a memory-based method trained on an unlabeled data stream, where every data added to memory is labeled using an oracle. Our approach outperforms existing semi-supervised methods when few labels are available, and obtain similar results to state-of-the-art supervised methods while using only 2.6% of labels on Split-CIFAR10 and 10% of labels on Split-CIFAR100.

<p>

**Abstract:** Accurate protein structure prediction can significantly accelerate the development of life science. The accuracy of AlphaFold2, a frontier end-to-end structure prediction system, is already close to that of the experimental determination techniques. Due to the complex model architecture and large memory consumption, it requires lots of computational resources and time to implement the training and inference of AlphaFold2 from scratch. The cost of running the original AlphaFold2 is expensive for most individuals and institutions. Therefore, reducing this cost could accelerate the development of life science. We implement AlphaFold2 using PaddlePaddle, namely HelixFold, to improve training and inference speed and reduce memory consumption. The performance is improved by operator fusion, tensor fusion, and hybrid parallelism computation, while the memory is optimized through Recompute, BFloat16, and memory read/write in-place. Compared with the original AlphaFold2 (implemented with Jax) and OpenFold (implemented with PyTorch), HelixFold needs only 7.5 days to complete the full end-to-end training and only 5.3 days when using hybrid parallelism, while both AlphaFold2 and OpenFold take about 11 days. HelixFold saves 1x training time. We verified that HelixFold's accuracy could be on par with AlphaFold2 on the CASP14 and CAMEO datasets. HelixFold's code is available on GitHub for free download: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix/tree/dev/apps/protein_folding/helixfold, and we also provide stable web services on https://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/drug/protein/forecast.

**Abstract:** Absolute pose regressor (APR) networks are trained to estimate the pose of the camera given a captured image. They compute latent image representations from which the camera position and orientation are regressed. APRs provide a different tradeoff between localization accuracy, runtime, and memory, compared to structure-based localization schemes that provide state-of-the-art accuracy. In this work, we introduce Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs), multilayer perceptrons that are trained via a Teacher-Student approach to encode camera poses using APRs as their teachers. We show that the resulting latent pose representations can closely reproduce APR performance and demonstrate their effectiveness for related tasks. Specifically, we propose a light-weight test-time optimization in which the closest train poses are encoded and used to refine camera position estimation. This procedure achieves a new state-of-the-art position accuracy for APRs, on both the CambridgeLandmarks and 7Scenes benchmarks. We also show that train images can be reconstructed from the learned pose encoding, paving the way for integrating visual information from the train set at a low memory cost. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders.

<p>

**Abstract:** Despite their advantages, normalizing flows generally suffer from several shortcomings including their tendency to generate unrealistic data (e.g., images) and their failing to detect out-of-distribution data. One reason for these deficiencies lies in the training strategy which traditionally exploits a maximum likelihood principle only. This paper proposes a new training paradigm based on a hybrid objective function combining the maximum likelihood principle (MLE) and a sliced-Wasserstein distance. Results obtained on synthetic toy examples and real image data sets show better generative abilities in terms of both likelihood and visual aspects of the generated samples. Reciprocally, the proposed approach leads to a lower likelihood of out-of-distribution data, demonstrating a greater data fidelity of the resulting flows.

**Abstract:** Real-estate image tagging is one of the essential use-cases to save efforts involved in manual annotation and enhance the user experience. This paper proposes an end-to-end pipeline (referred to as RE-Tagger) for the real-estate image classification problem. We present a two-stage transfer learning approach using custom InceptionV3 architecture to classify images into different categories (i.e., bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, balcony, hall, and others). Finally, we released the application as REST API hosted as a web application running on 2 cores machine with 2 GB RAM. The demo video is available here.

**Abstract:** The convergence of stochastic interacting particle systems in the mean-field limit to solutions to conservative stochastic partial differential equations is shown, with optimal rate of convergence. As a second main result, a quantitative central limit theorem for such SPDEs is derived, again with optimal rate of convergence.
  The results apply in particular to the convergence in the mean-field scaling of stochastic gradient descent dynamics in overparametrized, shallow neural networks to solutions to SPDEs. It is shown that the inclusion of fluctuations in the limiting SPDE improves the rate of convergence, and retains information about the fluctuations of stochastic gradient descent in the continuum limit.

<p>

**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) are usually considered to be less light-weight than convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to the lack of inductive bias. Recent works thus resort to convolutions as a plug-and-play module and embed them in various ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that the convolutional kernels perform information aggregation to connect all tokens; however, they would be actually unnecessary for light-weight ViTs if this explicit aggregation could function in a more homogeneous way. Inspired by this, we present LightViT as a new family of light-weight ViTs to achieve better accuracy-efficiency balance upon the pure transformer blocks without convolution. Concretely, we introduce a global yet efficient aggregation scheme into both self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) of ViTs, where additional learnable tokens are introduced to capture global dependencies; and bi-dimensional channel and spatial attentions are imposed over token embeddings. Experiments show that our model achieves significant improvements on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. For example, our LightViT-T achieves 78.7% accuracy on ImageNet with only 0.7G FLOPs, outperforming PVTv2-B0 by 8.2% while 11% faster on GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/hunto/LightViT.

**Abstract:** Learning predictors that do not rely on spurious correlations involves building causal representations. However, learning such a representation is very challenging. We, therefore, formulate the problem of learning a causal representation from high dimensional data and study causal recovery with synthetic data. This work introduces a latent variable decoder model, Decoder BCD, for Bayesian causal discovery and performs experiments in mildly supervised and unsupervised settings. We present a series of synthetic experiments to characterize important factors for causal discovery and show that using known intervention targets as labels helps in unsupervised Bayesian inference over structure and parameters of linear Gaussian additive noise latent structural causal models.

**Abstract:** Crowd counting is a regression task that estimates the number of people in a scene image, which plays a vital role in a range of safety-critical applications, such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring and flow control. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of deep learning based crowd counting models to backdoor attacks, a major security threat to deep learning. A backdoor attack implants a backdoor trigger into a target model via data poisoning so as to control the model's predictions at test time. Different from image classification models on which most of existing backdoor attacks have been developed and tested, crowd counting models are regression models that output multi-dimensional density maps, thus requiring different techniques to manipulate.
  In this paper, we propose two novel Density Manipulation Backdoor Attacks (DMBA$^{-}$ and DMBA$^{+}$) to attack the model to produce arbitrarily large or small density estimations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DMBA attacks on five classic crowd counting models and four types of datasets. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the unique challenges of backdooring crowd counting models and reveal two key elements of effective attacks: 1) full and dense triggers and 2) manipulation of the ground truth counts or density maps. Our work could help evaluate the vulnerability of crowd counting models to potential backdoor attacks.

<p>

**Abstract:** Multi-object tracking (MOT) requires detecting and associating objects through frames. Unlike tracking via detected bounding boxes or tracking objects as points, we propose tracking objects as pixel-wise distributions. We instantiate this idea on a transformer-based architecture, P3AFormer, with pixel-wise propagation, prediction, and association. P3AFormer propagates pixel-wise features guided by flow information to pass messages between frames. Furthermore, P3AFormer adopts a meta-architecture to produce multi-scale object feature maps. During inference, a pixel-wise association procedure is proposed to recover object connections through frames based on the pixel-wise prediction. P3AFormer yields 81.2\% in terms of MOTA on the MOT17 benchmark -- the first among all transformer networks to reach 80\% MOTA in literature. P3AFormer also outperforms state-of-the-arts on the MOT20 and KITTI benchmarks.

<p>Yang Tan, Yang Li, Shao-Lun Huang, Xiao-Ping Zhang</p></summary>
<p>

**Abstract:** We propose two novel transferability metrics F-OTCE (Fast Optimal Transport based Conditional Entropy) and JC-OTCE (Joint Correspondence OTCE) to evaluate how much the source model (task) can benefit the learning of the target task and to learn more transferable representations for cross-domain cross-task transfer learning. Unlike the existing metric that requires evaluating the empirical transferability on auxiliary tasks, our metrics are auxiliary-free such that they can be computed much more efficiently. Specifically, F-OTCE estimates transferability by first solving an Optimal Transport (OT) problem between source and target distributions, and then uses the optimal coupling to compute the Negative Conditional Entropy between source and target labels. It can also serve as a loss function to maximize the transferability of the source model before finetuning on the target task. Meanwhile, JC-OTCE improves the transferability robustness of F-OTCE by including label distances in the OT problem, though it may incur additional computation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-OTCE and JC-OTCE outperform state-of-the-art auxiliary-free metrics by 18.85% and 28.88%, respectively in correlation coefficient with the ground-truth transfer accuracy. By eliminating the training cost of auxiliary tasks, the two metrics reduces the total computation time of the previous method from 43 minutes to 9.32s and 10.78s, respectively, for a pair of tasks. When used as a loss function, F-OTCE shows consistent improvements on the transfer accuracy of the source model in few-shot classification experiments, with up to 4.41% accuracy gain.

**Abstract:** In audio classification, differentiable auditory filterbanks with few parameters cover the middle ground between hard-coded spectrograms and raw audio. LEAF (arXiv:2101.08596), a Gabor-based filterbank combined with Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), has shown promising results, but is computationally expensive. With inhomogeneous convolution kernel sizes and strides, and by replacing PCEN with better parallelizable operations, we can reach similar results more efficiently. In experiments on six audio classification tasks, our frontend matches the accuracy of LEAF at 3% of the cost, but both fail to consistently outperform a fixed mel filterbank. The quest for learnable audio frontends is not solved.

<p>

**Abstract:** Inpainting has recently been proposed as a successful deep learning technique for unsupervised medical image model discovery. The masks used for inpainting are generally independent of the dataset and are not tailored to perform on different given classes of anatomy. In this work, we introduce a method for generating shape-aware masks for inpainting, which aims at learning the statistical shape prior. We hypothesize that although the variation of masks improves the generalizability of inpainting models, the shape of the masks should follow the topology of the organs of interest. Hence, we propose an unsupervised guided masking approach based on an off-the-shelf inpainting model and a superpixel over-segmentation algorithm to generate a wide range of shape-dependent masks. Experimental results on abdominal MR image reconstruction show the superiority of our proposed masking method over standard methods using square-shaped or dataset of irregular shape masks.

**Abstract:** In this paper we consider finding an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) of nonconvex conic optimization that minimizes a twice differentiable function over the intersection of an affine subspace and a convex cone. In particular, we propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) based barrier method for finding an $(Œµ,\sqrtŒµ)$-SOSP of this problem. Our method is not only implementable, but also achieves an iteration complexity of ${\cal O}(Œµ^{-3/2})$, which matches the best known iteration complexity of second-order methods for finding an $(Œµ,\sqrtŒµ)$-SOSP of unconstrained nonconvex optimization. The operation complexity of $\widetilde{\cal O}(Œµ^{-3/2}\min\{n,Œµ^{-1/4}\})$, measured by the amount of fundamental operations, is also established for our method.

**Abstract:** Recommendation systems have been widely used in various domains such as music, films, e-shopping etc. After mostly avoiding digitization, the art world has recently reached a technological turning point due to the pandemic, making online sales grow significantly as well as providing quantitative online data about artists and artworks. In this work, we present a content-based recommendation system on contemporary art relying on images of artworks and contextual metadata of artists. We gathered and annotated artworks with advanced and art-specific information to create a completely unique database that was used to train our models. With this information, we built a proximity graph between artworks. Similarly, we used NLP techniques to characterize the practices of the artists and we extracted information from exhibitions and other event history to create a proximity graph between artists. The power of graph analysis enables us to provide an artwork recommendation system based on a combination of visual and contextual information from artworks and artists. After an assessment by a team of art specialists, we get an average final rating of 75% of meaningful artworks when compared to their professional evaluations.

<p>

**Abstract:** Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods lack ground truth. In its place, method developers have relied on axioms to determine desirable properties for their explanations' behavior. For high stakes uses of machine learning that require explainability, it is not sufficient to rely on axioms as the implementation, or its usage, can fail to live up to the ideal. As a result, there exists active research on validating the performance of XAI methods. The need for validation is especially magnified in domains with a reliance on XAI. A procedure frequently used to assess their utility, and to some extent their fidelity, is an ablation study. By perturbing the input variables in rank order of importance, the goal is to assess the sensitivity of the model's performance. Perturbing important variables should correlate with larger decreases in measures of model capability than perturbing less important features. While the intent is clear, the actual implementation details have not been studied rigorously for tabular data. Using five datasets, three XAI methods, four baselines, and three perturbations, we aim to show 1) how varying perturbations and adding simple guardrails can help to avoid potentially flawed conclusions, 2) how treatment of categorical variables is an important consideration in both post-hoc explainability and ablation studies, and 3) how to identify useful baselines for XAI methods and viable perturbations for ablation studies.

**Abstract:** The Mean-Teacher (MT) scheme is widely adopted in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). In MT, the sparse pseudo labels, offered by the final predictions of the teacher (e.g., after Non Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing), are adopted for the dense supervision for the student via hand-crafted label assignment. However, the sparse-to-dense paradigm complicates the pipeline of SSOD, and simultaneously neglects the powerful direct, dense teacher supervision. In this paper, we attempt to directly leverage the dense guidance of teacher to supervise student training, i.e., the dense-to-dense paradigm. Specifically, we propose the Inverse NMS Clustering (INC) and Rank Matching (RM) to instantiate the dense supervision, without the widely used, conventional sparse pseudo labels. INC leads the student to group candidate boxes into clusters in NMS as the teacher does, which is implemented by learning grouping information revealed in NMS procedure of the teacher. After obtaining the same grouping scheme as the teacher via INC, the student further imitates the rank distribution of the teacher over clustered candidates through Rank Matching. With the proposed INC and RM, we integrate Dense Teacher Guidance into Semi-Supervised Object Detection (termed DTG-SSOD), successfully abandoning sparse pseudo labels and enabling more informative learning on unlabeled data. On COCO benchmark, our DTG-SSOD achieves state-of-the-art performance under various labelling ratios. For example, under 10% labelling ratio, DTG-SSOD improves the supervised baseline from 26.9 to 35.9 mAP, outperforming the previous best method Soft Teacher by 1.9 points.

**Abstract:** Manual annotation of vertebrae on spinal X-ray imaging is costly and time-consuming due to bone shape complexity and image quality variations. In this study, we address this challenge by proposing an ensemble method called VertXNet, to automatically segment and label vertebrae in X-ray spinal images. VertXNet combines two state-of-the-art segmentation models, namely U-Net and Mask R-CNN to improve vertebrae segmentation. A main feature of VertXNet is to also infer vertebrae labels thanks to its Mask R-CNN component (trained to detect 'reference' vertebrae) on a given spinal X-ray image. VertXNet was evaluated on an in-house dataset of lateral cervical and lumbar X-ray imaging for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Our results show that VertXNet can accurately label spinal X-rays (mean Dice of 0.9). It can be used to circumvent the lack of annotated vertebrae without requiring human expert review. This step is crucial to investigate clinical associations by solving the lack of segmentation, a common bottleneck for most computational imaging projects.

**Abstract:** Learning against label noise is a vital topic to guarantee a reliable performance for deep neural networks. Recent research usually refers to dynamic noise modeling with model output probabilities and loss values, and then separates clean and noisy samples. These methods have gained notable success. However, unlike cherry-picked data, existing approaches often cannot perform well when facing imbalanced datasets, a common scenario in the real world. We thoroughly investigate this phenomenon and point out two major issues that hinder the performance, i.e., \emph{inter-class loss distribution discrepancy} and \emph{misleading predictions due to uncertainty}. The first issue is that existing methods often perform class-agnostic noise modeling. However, loss distributions show a significant discrepancy among classes under class imbalance, and class-agnostic noise modeling can easily get confused with noisy samples and samples in minority classes. The second issue refers to that models may output misleading predictions due to epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty, thus existing methods that rely solely on the output probabilities may fail to distinguish confident samples. Inspired by our observations, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Label Correction framework~(ULC) to handle label noise on imbalanced datasets. First, we perform epistemic uncertainty-aware class-specific noise modeling to identify trustworthy clean samples and refine/discard highly confident true/corrupted labels. Then, we introduce aleatoric uncertainty in the subsequent learning process to prevent noise accumulation in the label noise modeling process. We conduct experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially on imbalanced datasets.

**Abstract:** De-identification of data used for automatic speech recognition modeling is a critical component in protecting privacy, especially in the medical domain. However, simply removing all personally identifiable information (PII) from end-to-end model training data leads to a significant performance degradation in particular for the recognition of names, dates, locations, and words from similar categories. We propose and evaluate a two-step method for partially recovering this loss. First, PII is identified, and each occurrence is replaced with a random word sequence of the same category. Then, corresponding audio is produced via text-to-speech or by splicing together matching audio fragments extracted from the corpus. These artificial audio/label pairs, together with speaker turns from the original data without PII, are used to train models. We evaluate the performance of this method on in-house data of medical conversations and observe a recovery of almost the entire performance degradation in the general word error rate while still maintaining a strong diarization performance. Our main focus is the improvement of recall and precision in the recognition of PII-related words. Depending on the PII category, between $50\% - 90\%$ of the performance degradation can be recovered using our proposed method.

**Abstract:** Translation, rotation, and scaling are three commonly used geometric manipulation operations in image processing. Besides, some of them are successfully used in developing effective knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models such as TransE and RotatE. Inspired by the synergy, we propose a new KGE model by leveraging all three operations in this work. Since translation, rotation, and scaling operations are cascaded to form a compound one, the new model is named CompoundE. By casting CompoundE in the framework of group theory, we show that quite a few scoring-function-based KGE models are special cases of CompoundE. CompoundE extends the simple distance-based relation to relation-dependent compound operations on head and/or tail entities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CompoundE, we conduct experiments on three popular KG completion datasets. Experimental results show that CompoundE consistently achieves the state of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Active regression considers a linear regression problem where the learner receives a large number of data points but can only observe a small number of labels. Since online algorithms can deal with incremental training data and take advantage of low computational cost, we consider an online extension of the active regression problem: the learner receives data points one by one and immediately decides whether it should collect the corresponding labels. The goal is to efficiently maintain the regression of received data points with a small budget of label queries. We propose novel algorithms for this problem under $\ell_p$ loss where $p\in[1,2]$. To achieve a $(1+Œµ)$-approximate solution, our proposed algorithms only require $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(Œµ^{-2} d \log(nŒ∫))$ queries of labels, where $n$ is the number of data points and $Œ∫$ is a quantity, called the condition number, of the data points. The numerical results verify our theoretical results and show that our methods have comparable performance with offline active regression algorithms.

<p>

**Abstract:** A new attention-based model for the gradient boosting machine (GBM) called AGBoost (the attention-based gradient boosting) is proposed for solving regression problems. The main idea behind the proposed AGBoost model is to assign attention weights with trainable parameters to iterations of GBM under condition that decision trees are base learners in GBM. Attention weights are determined by applying properties of decision trees and by using the Huber's contamination model which provides an interesting linear dependence between trainable parameters of the attention and the attention weights. This peculiarity allows us to train the attention weights by solving the standard quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. The attention weights also depend on the discount factor as a tuning parameter, which determines how much the impact of the weight is decreased with the number of iterations. Numerical experiments performed for two types of base learners, original decision trees and extremely randomized trees with various regression datasets illustrate the proposed model.

**Abstract:** Polypharmacy, defined as the use of multiple drugs together, is a standard treatment method, especially for severe and chronic diseases. However, using multiple drugs together may cause interactions between drugs. Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is the activity that occurs when the impact of one drug changes when combined with another. DDIs may obstruct, increase, or decrease the intended effect of either drug or, in the worst-case scenario, create adverse side effects. While it is critical to detect DDIs on time, it is timeconsuming and expensive to identify them in clinical trials due to their short duration and many possible drug pairs to be considered for testing. As a result, computational methods are needed for predicting DDIs. In this paper, we present a novel heterogeneous graph attention model, HAN-DDI to predict drug-drug interactions. We create a heterogeneous network of drugs with different biological entities. Then, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network to learn DDIs using relations of drugs with other entities. It consists of an attention-based heterogeneous graph node encoder for obtaining drug node representations and a decoder for predicting drug-drug interactions. Further, we utilize comprehensive experiments to evaluate of our model and to compare it with state-of-the-art models. Experimental results show that our proposed method, HAN-DDI, outperforms the baselines significantly and accurately predicts DDIs, even for new drugs.

**Abstract:** In this work, we suggest Kernel Filtering Linear Overparameterization (KFLO), where a linear cascade of filtering layers is used during training to improve network performance in test time. We implement this cascade in a kernel filtering fashion, which prevents the trained architecture from becoming unnecessarily deeper. This also allows using our approach with almost any network architecture and let combining the filtering layers into a single layer in test time. Thus, our approach does not add computational complexity during inference. We demonstrate the advantage of KFLO on various network models and datasets in supervised learning.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art speaker verification systems are inherently dependent on some kind of human supervision as they are trained on massive amounts of labeled data. However, manually annotating utterances is slow, expensive and not scalable to the amount of data available today. In this study, we explore self-supervised learning for speaker verification by learning representations directly from raw audio. The objective is to produce robust speaker embeddings that have small intra-speaker and large inter-speaker variance. Our approach is based on recent information maximization learning frameworks and an intensive data augmentation pre-processing step. We evaluate the ability of these methods to work without contrastive samples before showing that they achieve better performance when combined with a contrastive loss. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to show that our method reaches competitive results compared to existing techniques and can get better performances compared to a supervised baseline when fine-tuned with a small portion of labeled data.

**Abstract:** We propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. The data of interest consist of a collection of multiple series of probability measures supported over a bounded interval of the real line, and that are indexed by distinct time instants. The probability measures are modelled as random objects in the Wasserstein space. We establish the auto-regressive model in the tangent space at the Lebesgue measure by first centering all the raw measures so that their Fr√©chet means turn to be the Lebesgue measure. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the model coefficient. In addition to the analysis of simulated data, the proposed model is illustrated with two real data sets made of observations from age distribution in different countries and bike sharing network in Paris. Finally, due to the positive and boundedness constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows furthermore the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from the multivariate distributional time series.

**Abstract:** With the success of self-supervised learning (SSL), it has become a mainstream paradigm to fine-tune from self-supervised pretrained models to boost the performance on downstream tasks. However, we find that current SSL models suffer severe accuracy drops when performing low-bit quantization, prohibiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. In this paper, we propose a method called synergistic self-supervised and quantization learning (SSQL) to pretrain quantization-friendly self-supervised models facilitating downstream deployment. SSQL contrasts the features of the quantized and full precision models in a self-supervised fashion, where the bit-width for the quantized model is randomly selected in each step. SSQL not only significantly improves the accuracy when quantized to lower bit-widths, but also boosts the accuracy of full precision models in most cases. By only training once, SSQL can then benefit various downstream tasks at different bit-widths simultaneously. Moreover, the bit-width flexibility is achieved without additional storage overhead, requiring only one copy of weights during training and inference. We theoretically analyze the optimization process of SSQL, and conduct exhaustive experiments on various benchmarks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/SSQL-ECCV2022.

**Abstract:** Continual learning -- accumulating knowledge from a sequence of learning experiences -- is an important yet challenging problem. In this paradigm, the model's performance for previously encountered instances may substantially drop as additional data are seen. When dealing with class-imbalanced data, forgetting is further exacerbated. Prior work has proposed replay-based approaches which aim at reducing forgetting by intelligently storing instances for future replay. Although Class-Balancing Reservoir Sampling (CBRS) has been successful in dealing with imbalanced data, the intra-class diversity has not been accounted for, implicitly assuming that each instance of a class is equally informative. We present Diverse-CBRS (D-CBRS), an algorithm that allows us to consider within class diversity when storing instances in the memory. Our results show that D-CBRS outperforms state-of-the-art memory management continual learning algorithms on data sets with considerable intra-class diversity.

**Abstract:** Conventionally, Earth system (e.g., weather and climate) forecasting relies on numerical simulation with complex physical models and are hence both expensive in computation and demanding on domain expertise. With the explosive growth of the spatiotemporal Earth observation data in the past decade, data-driven models that apply Deep Learning (DL) are demonstrating impressive potential for various Earth system forecasting tasks. The Transformer as an emerging DL architecture, despite its broad success in other domains, has limited adoption in this area. In this paper, we propose Earthformer, a space-time Transformer for Earth system forecasting. Earthformer is based on a generic, flexible and efficient space-time attention block, named Cuboid Attention. The idea is to decompose the data into cuboids and apply cuboid-level self-attention in parallel. These cuboids are further connected with a collection of global vectors. We conduct experiments on the MovingMNIST dataset and a newly proposed chaotic N-body MNIST dataset to verify the effectiveness of cuboid attention and figure out the best design of Earthformer. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks about precipitation nowcasting and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasting show Earthformer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Emotion prediction plays an essential role in mental health and emotion-aware computing. The complex nature of emotion resulting from its dependency on a person's physiological health, mental state, and his surroundings makes its prediction a challenging task. In this work, we utilize mobile sensing data to predict happiness and stress. In addition to a person's physiological features, we also incorporate the environment's impact through weather and social network. To this end, we leverage phone data to construct social networks and develop a machine learning architecture that aggregates information from multiple users of the graph network and integrates it with the temporal dynamics of data to predict emotion for all the users. The construction of social networks does not incur additional cost in terms of EMAs or data collection from users and doesn't raise privacy concerns. We propose an architecture that automates the integration of a user's social network affect prediction, is capable of dealing with the dynamic distribution of real-life social networks, making it scalable to large-scale networks. Our extensive evaluation highlights the improvement provided by the integration of social networks. We further investigate the impact of graph topology on model's performance.

**Abstract:** Identifying spans in medical texts that correspond to medical entities is one of the core steps for many healthcare NLP tasks such as ICD coding, medical finding extraction, medical note contextualization, to name a few. Existing entity extraction methods rely on a fixed and limited vocabulary of medical entities and have difficulty with extracting entities represented by disjoint spans. In this paper, we present a new transformer-based architecture called OSLAT, Open Set Label Attention Transformer, that addresses many of the limitations of the previous methods. Our approach uses the label-attention mechanism to implicitly learn spans associated with entities of interest. These entities can be provided as free text, including entities not seen during OSLAT's training, and the model can extract spans even when they are disjoint. To test the generalizability of our method, we train two separate models on two different datasets, which have very low entity overlap: (1) a public discharge notes dataset from hNLP, and (2) a much more challenging proprietary patient text dataset "Reasons for Encounter" (RFE). We find that OSLAT models trained on either dataset outperform rule-based and fuzzy string matching baselines when applied to the RFE dataset as well as to the portion of hNLP dataset where entities are represented by disjoint spans. Our code can be found at https://github.com/curai/curai-research/tree/main/OSLAT.

**Abstract:** In this work we evaluate the applicability of an ensemble of population models and machine learning models to predict the near future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular use case in Spain. We rely solely in open and public datasets, fusing incidence, vaccination, human mobility and weather data to feed our machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, k-Nearest Neighbours and Kernel Ridge Regression). We use the incidence data to adjust classic population models (Gompertz, Logistic, Richards, Bertalanffy) in order to be able to better capture the trend of the data. We then ensemble these two families of models in order to obtain a more robust and accurate prediction. Furthermore, we have observed an improvement in the predictions obtained with machine learning models as we add new features (vaccines, mobility, climatic conditions), analyzing the importance of each of them using Shapley Additive Explanation values. As in any other modelling work, data and predictions quality have several limitations and therefore they must be seen from a critical standpoint, as we discuss in the text. Our work concludes that the ensemble use of these models improves the individual predictions (using only machine learning models or only population models) and can be applied, with caution, in cases when compartmental models cannot be utilized due to the lack of relevant data.

**Abstract:** The volume of fluid (VoF) method is widely used in multi-phase flow simulations to track and locate the interface between two immiscible fluids. A major bottleneck of the VoF method is the interface reconstruction step due to its high computational cost and low accuracy on unstructured grids. We propose a machine learning enhanced VoF method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to accelerate the interface reconstruction on general unstructured meshes. We first develop a methodology to generate a synthetic dataset based on paraboloid surfaces discretized on unstructured meshes. We then train a GNN based model and perform generalization tests. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of a GNN based approach for interface reconstruction in multi-phase flow simulations in the industrial context.

**Abstract:** Recent algorithms designed for reinforcement learning tasks focus on finding a single optimal solution. However, in many practical applications, it is important to develop reasonable agents with diverse strategies. In this paper, we propose Diversity-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), an on-policy framework for discovering multiple strategies for the same task. Our algorithm uses diversity objectives to guide a latent code conditioned policy to learn a set of diverse strategies in a single training procedure. Specifically, we formalize our algorithm as the combination of a diversity-constrained optimization problem and an extrinsic-reward constrained optimization problem. And we solve the constrained optimization as a probabilistic inference task and use policy iteration to maximize the derived lower bound. Experimental results show that our method efficiently finds diverse strategies in a wide variety of reinforcement learning tasks. We further show that DGPO achieves a higher diversity score and has similar sample complexity and performance compared to other baselines.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a novel conservative chaotic standard map-driven dynamic DNA coding (encoding, addition, subtraction and decoding) for the image encryption. The proposed image encryption algorithm is a dynamic DNA coding algorithm i.e., for the encryption of each pixel different rules for encoding, addition/subtraction, decoding etc. are randomly selected based on the pseudorandom sequences generated with the help of the conservative chaotic standard map. We propose a novel way to generate pseudo-random sequences through the conservative chaotic standard map and also test them rigorously through the most stringent test suite of pseudo-randomness, the NIST test suite, before using them in the proposed image encryption algorithm. Our image encryption algorithm incorporates a unique feed-forward and feedback mechanisms to generate and modify the dynamic one-time pixels that are further used for the encryption of each pixel of the plain image, therefore, bringing in the desired sensitivity on plaintext as well as ciphertext. All the controlling pseudorandom sequences used in the algorithm are generated for a different value of the parameter (part of the secret key) with inter-dependency through the iterates of the chaotic map (in the generation process) and therefore possess extreme key sensitivity too. The performance and security analysis has been executed extensively through histogram analysis, correlation analysis, information entropy analysis, DNA sequence-based analysis, perceptual quality analysis, key sensitivity analysis, plaintext sensitivity analysis, etc., The results are promising and prove the robustness of the algorithm against various common cryptanalytic attacks.

**Abstract:** The deployment of an expert system running over a wireless acoustic sensors network made up of bioacoustic monitoring devices that recognise bird species from their sounds would enable the automation of many tasks of ecological value, including the analysis of bird population composition or the detection of endangered species in areas of environmental interest. Endowing these devices with accurate audio classification capabilities is possible thanks to the latest advances in artificial intelligence, among which deep learning techniques excel. However, a key issue to make bioacoustic devices affordable is the use of small footprint deep neural networks that can be embedded in resource and battery constrained hardware platforms. For this reason, this work presents a critical comparative analysis between two heavy and large footprint deep neural networks (VGG16 and ResNet50) and a lightweight alternative, MobileNetV2. Our experimental results reveal that MobileNetV2 achieves an average F1-score less than a 5\% lower than ResNet50 (0.789 vs. 0.834), performing better than VGG16 with a footprint size nearly 40 times smaller. Moreover, to compare the models, we have created and made public the Western Mediterranean Wetland Birds dataset, consisting of 201.6 minutes and 5,795 audio excerpts of 20 endemic bird species of the Aiguamolls de l'Empord√† Natural Park.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a motion-based robotic communication framework that enables non-verbal communication among autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and human divers. We design a gestural language for AUV-to-AUV communication which can be easily understood by divers observing the conversation unlike typical radio frequency, light, or audio based AUV communication. To allow AUVs to visually understand a gesture from another AUV, we propose a deep network (RRCommNet) which exploits a self-attention mechanism to learn to recognize each message by extracting maximally discriminative spatio-temporal features. We train this network on diverse simulated and real-world data. Our experimental evaluations, both in simulation and in closed-water robot trials, demonstrate that the proposed RRCommNet architecture is able to decipher gesture-based messages with an average accuracy of 88-94% on simulated data, 73-83% on real data (depending on the version of the model used). Further, by performing a message transcription study with human participants, we also show that the proposed language can be understood by humans, with an overall transcription accuracy of 88%. Finally, we discuss the inference runtime of RRCommNet on embedded GPU hardware, for real-time use on board AUVs in the field.

**Abstract:** During the radiotherapy treatment of patients with lung cancer, the radiation delivered to healthy tissue around the tumor needs to be minimized, which is difficult because of respiratory motion and the latency of linear accelerator systems. In the proposed study, we first use the Lucas-Kanade pyramidal optical flow algorithm to perform deformable image registration of chest computed tomography scan images of four patients with lung cancer. We then track three internal points close to the lung tumor based on the previously computed deformation field and predict their position with a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained using real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) and gradient clipping. The breathing data is quite regular, sampled at approximately 2.5Hz, and includes artificial drift in the spine direction. The amplitude of the motion of the tracked points ranged from 12.0mm to 22.7mm. Finally, we propose a simple method for recovering and predicting 3D tumor images from the tracked points and the initial tumor image based on a linear correspondence model and Nadaraya-Watson non-linear regression. The root-mean-square error, maximum error, and jitter corresponding to the RNN prediction on the test set were smaller than the same performance measures obtained with linear prediction and least mean squares (LMS). In particular, the maximum prediction error associated with the RNN, equal to 1.51mm, is respectively 16.1% and 5.0% lower than the maximum error associated with linear prediction and LMS. The average prediction time per time step with RTRL is equal to 119ms, which is less than the 400ms marker position sampling time. The tumor position in the predicted images appears visually correct, which is confirmed by the high mean cross-correlation between the original and predicted images, equal to 0.955.

**Abstract:** Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum is widely used for training modern deep learning architectures. While it is well-understood that using momentum can lead to faster convergence rate in various settings, it has also been observed that momentum yields higher generalization. Prior work argue that momentum stabilizes the SGD noise during training and this leads to higher generalization. In this paper, we adopt another perspective and first empirically show that gradient descent with momentum (GD+M) significantly improves generalization compared to gradient descent (GD) in some deep learning problems. From this observation, we formally study how momentum improves generalization. We devise a binary classification setting where a one-hidden layer (over-parameterized) convolutional neural network trained with GD+M provably generalizes better than the same network trained with GD, when both algorithms are similarly initialized. The key insight in our analysis is that momentum is beneficial in datasets where the examples share some feature but differ in their margin. Contrary to GD that memorizes the small margin data, GD+M still learns the feature in these data thanks to its historical gradients. Lastly, we empirically validate our theoretical findings.

**Abstract:** We study representation learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), focusing on the important task of Offline Policy Evaluation (OPE). Recent work shows that, in contrast to supervised learning, realizability of the Q-function is not enough for learning it. Two sufficient conditions for sample-efficient OPE are Bellman completeness and coverage. Prior work often assumes that representations satisfying these conditions are given, with results being mostly theoretical in nature. In this work, we propose BCRL, which directly learns from data an approximately linear Bellman complete representation with good coverage. With this learned representation, we perform OPE using Least Square Policy Evaluation (LSPE) with linear functions in our learned representation. We present an end-to-end theoretical analysis, showing that our two-stage algorithm enjoys polynomial sample complexity provided some representation in the rich class considered is linear Bellman complete. Empirically, we extensively evaluate our algorithm on challenging, image-based continuous control tasks from the Deepmind Control Suite. We show our representation enables better OPE compared to previous representation learning methods developed for off-policy RL (e.g., CURL, SPR). BCRL achieve competitive OPE error with the state-of-the-art method Fitted Q-Evaluation (FQE), and beats FQE when evaluating beyond the initial state distribution. Our ablations show that both linear Bellman complete and coverage components of our method are crucial.

**Abstract:** A retinal trait, or phenotype, summarises a specific aspect of a retinal image in a single number. This can then be used for further analyses, e.g. with statistical methods. However, reducing an aspect of a complex image to a single, meaningful number is challenging. Thus, methods for calculating retinal traits tend to be complex, multi-step pipelines that can only be applied to high quality images. This means that researchers often have to discard substantial portions of the available data. We hypothesise that such pipelines can be approximated with a single, simpler step that can be made robust to common quality issues. We propose Deep Approximation of Retinal Traits (DART) where a deep neural network is used predict the output of an existing pipeline on high quality images from synthetically degraded versions of these images. We demonstrate DART on retinal Fractal Dimension (FD) calculated by VAMPIRE, using retinal images from UK Biobank that previous work identified as high quality. Our method shows very high agreement with FD VAMPIRE on unseen test images (Pearson r=0.9572). Even when those images are severely degraded, DART can still recover an FD estimate that shows good agreement with FD VAMPIRE obtained from the original images (Pearson r=0.8817). This suggests that our method could enable researchers to discard fewer images in the future. Our method can compute FD for over 1,000img/s using a single GPU. We consider these to be very encouraging initial results and hope to develop this approach into a useful tool for retinal analysis.

**Abstract:** Nuclear fusion power created by tokamak devices holds one of the most promising ways as a sustainable source of clean energy. One main challenge research field of tokamak is to predict the last closed magnetic flux surface (LCFS) determined by the interaction of the actuator coils and the internal tokamak plasma. This work requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, high-fidelity, real-time tools, further complicated by the wide range of actuator coils input interact with internal tokamak plasma states. In this work, we present a new machine learning model for reconstructing the LCFS from the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) that learns automatically from the experimental data of EAST. This architecture can check the control strategy design and integrate it with the tokamak control system for real-time magnetic prediction. In the real-time modeling test, our approach achieves over 99% average similarity in LCFS reconstruction of the entire discharge process. In the offline magnetic reconstruction, our approach reaches over 93% average similarity.

**Abstract:** Nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be used to model a number of machine learning problems, such as multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision processes. However, such kinds of problems are challenging because both the objective and constraints are possibly nonconvex, so it is difficult to balance the reduction of the loss value and reduction of constraint violation. Although there are a few methods that solve this class of problems, all of them are double-loop or triple-loop algorithms, and they require oracles to solve some subproblems up to certain accuracy by tuning multiple hyperparameters at each iteration. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient descent and perturbed ascent (GDPA) algorithm to solve a class of smooth nonconvex inequality constrained problems. The GDPA is a primal-dual algorithm, which only exploits the first-order information of both the objective and constraint functions to update the primal and dual variables in an alternating way. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is a single-loop algorithm, where only two step-sizes need to be tuned. We show that under a mild regularity condition GDPA is able to find Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of nonconvex functional constrained problems with convergence rate guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first single-loop algorithm that can solve the general nonconvex smooth problems with nonconvex inequality constraints. Numerical results also showcase the superiority of GDPA compared with the best-known algorithms (in terms of both stationarity measure and feasibility of the obtained solutions).

**Abstract:** Deep belief networks (DBNs) are stochastic neural networks that can extract rich internal representations of the environment from the sensory data. DBNs had a catalytic effect in triggering the deep learning revolution, demonstrating for the very first time the feasibility of unsupervised learning in networks with many layers of hidden neurons. Thanks to their biological and cognitive plausibility, these hierarchical architectures have been also successfully exploited to build computational models of human perception and cognition in a variety of domains. However, learning in DBNs is usually carried out in a greedy, layer-wise fashion, which does not allow to simulate the holistic development of cortical circuits. Here we present iDBN, an iterative learning algorithm for DBNs that allows to jointly update the connection weights across all layers of the hierarchy. We test our algorithm on two different sets of visual stimuli, and we show that network development can also be tracked in terms of graph theoretical properties. DBNs trained using our iterative approach achieve a final performance comparable to that of the greedy counterparts, at the same time allowing to accurately analyze the gradual development of internal representations in the generative model. Our work paves the way to the use of iDBN for modeling neurocognitive development.

The data was collected between 2020 and 2022 that aimed to develop machine learning methods for online anomaly detection and failure prediction. By capturing several analogic sensor signals (pressure, temperature, current consumption), digital signals (control signals, discrete signals), and GPS information (latitude, longitude, and speed), we provide a framework that can be easily used and developed for the new machine learning methods. We believe this dataset contains some interesting characteristics and can be a good benchmark for predictive maintenance models.

**Abstract:** Image captioning research achieved breakthroughs in recent years by developing neural models that can generate diverse and high-quality descriptions for images drawn from the same distribution as training images. However, when facing out-of-distribution (OOD) images, such as corrupted images, or images containing unknown objects, the models fail in generating relevant captions.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of OOD detection in image captioning. We formulate the problem and suggest an evaluation setup for assessing the model's performance on the task. Then, we analyze and show the effectiveness of the caption's likelihood score at detecting and rejecting OOD images, which implies that the relatedness between the input image and the generated caption is encapsulated within the score.

**Abstract:** Time is one of the most significant characteristics of time-series, yet has received insufficient attention. Prior time-series forecasting research has mainly focused on mapping a past subseries (lookback window) to a future series (forecast window), and time of series often just play an auxiliary role even completely ignored in most cases. Due to the point-wise processing within these windows, extrapolating series to longer-term future is tough in the pattern. To overcome this barrier, we propose a brand-new time-series forecasting framework named Dateformer who turns attention to modeling time instead of following the above practice. Specifically, time-series are first split into patches by day to supervise the learning of dynamic date-representations with Date Encoder Representations from Transformers (DERT). These representations are then fed into a simple decoder to produce a coarser (or global) prediction, and used to help the model seek valuable information from the lookback window to learn a refined (or local) prediction. Dateformer obtains the final result by summing the above two parts. Our empirical studies on seven benchmarks show that the time-modeling method is more efficient for long-term series forecasting compared with sequence modeling methods. Dateformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy with a 40% remarkable relative improvement, and broadens the maximum credible forecasting range to a half-yearly level.

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) with large-scale image-text pairs has demonstrated superior performance in various fields. However, the image-text pairs co-occurrent on the Internet typically lack explicit alignment information, which is suboptimal for VLP. Existing methods proposed to adopt an off-the-shelf object detector to utilize additional image tag information. However, the object detector is time-consuming and can only identify the pre-defined object categories, limiting the model capacity. Inspired by the observation that the texts incorporate incomplete fine-grained image information, we introduce IDEA, which stands for increasing text diversity via online multi-label recognition for VLP. IDEA shows that multi-label learning with image tags extracted from the texts can be jointly optimized during VLP. Moreover, IDEA can identify valuable image tags online to provide more explicit textual supervision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that IDEA can significantly boost the performance on multiple downstream datasets with a small extra computational cost.

**Abstract:** Analog/mixed-signal circuit design is one of the most complex and time-consuming stages in the whole chip design process. Due to various process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations from chip manufacturing, analog circuits inevitably suffer from performance degradation. Although there has been plenty of work on automating analog circuit design under the typical condition, limited research has been done on exploring robust designs under real and unpredictable silicon variations. Automatic analog design against variations requires prohibitive computation and time costs. To address the challenge, we present RobustAnalog, a robust circuit design framework that involves the variation information in the optimization process. Specifically, circuit optimizations under different variations are considered as a set of tasks. Similarities among tasks are leveraged and competitions are alleviated to realize a sample-efficient multi-task training. Moreover, RobustAnalog prunes the task space according to the current performance in each iteration, leading to a further simulation cost reduction. In this way, RobustAnalog can rapidly produce a set of circuit parameters that satisfies diverse constraints (e.g. gain, bandwidth, noise...) across variations. We compare RobustAnalog with Bayesian optimization, Evolutionary algorithm, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and demonstrate that RobustAnalog can significantly reduce required optimization time by 14-30 times. Therefore, our study provides a feasible method to handle various real silicon conditions.

**Abstract:** Abstract knowledge is deeply grounded in many computer-based applications. An important research area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deals with the automatic derivation of knowledge from data. Machine learning offers the according algorithms. One area of research focuses on the development of biologically inspired learning algorithms. The respective machine learning methods are based on neurological concepts so that they can systematically derive knowledge from data and store it. One type of machine learning algorithms that can be categorized as "deep learning" model is referred to as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). DNNs consist of multiple artificial neurons arranged in layers that are trained by using the backpropagation algorithm. These deep learning methods exhibit amazing capabilities for inferring and storing complex knowledge from high-dimensional data. However, DNNs are affected by a problem that prevents new knowledge from being added to an existing base. The ability to continuously accumulate knowledge is an important factor that contributed to evolution and is therefore a prerequisite for the development of strong AIs. The so-called "catastrophic forgetting" (CF) effect causes DNNs to immediately loose already derived knowledge after a few training iterations on a new data distribution. Only an energetically expensive retraining with the joint data distribution of past and new data enables the abstraction of the entire new set of knowledge. In order to counteract the effect, various techniques have been and are still being developed with the goal to mitigate or even solve the CF problem. These published CF avoidance studies usually imply the effectiveness of their approaches for various continual learning tasks. This dissertation is set in the context of continual machine learning with deep learning methods. The first part deals with the development of an ...

**Abstract:** Open-set recognition (OSR) aims to simultaneously detect unknown-class samples and classify known-class samples. Most of the existing OSR methods are inductive methods, which generally suffer from the domain shift problem that the learned model from the known-class domain might be unsuitable for the unknown-class domain. Addressing this problem, inspired by the success of transductive learning for alleviating the domain shift problem in many other visual tasks, we propose an Iterative Transductive OSR framework, called IT-OSR, which implements three explored modules iteratively, including a reliability sampling module, a feature generation module, and a baseline update module. Specifically, at each iteration, a dual-space consistent sampling approach is presented in the explored reliability sampling module for selecting some relatively more reliable ones from the test samples according to their pseudo labels assigned by a baseline method, which could be an arbitrary inductive OSR method. Then, a conditional dual-adversarial generative network under an orthogonal coding condition is designed in the feature generation module to generate discriminative sample features of both known and unknown classes according to the selected test samples with their pseudo labels. Finally, the baseline method is updated for sample re-prediction in the baseline update module by jointly utilizing the generated features, the selected test samples with pseudo labels, and the training samples. Extensive experimental results on both the standard-dataset and the cross-dataset settings demonstrate that the derived transductive methods, by introducing two typical inductive OSR methods into the proposed IT-OSR framework, achieve better performances than 15 state-of-the-art methods in most cases.

**Abstract:** The immune response is a dynamic process by which the body determines whether an antigen is self or nonself. The state of this dynamic process is defined by the relative balance and population of inflammatory and regulatory actors which comprise this decision making process. The goal of immunotherapy as applied to, e.g. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), then, is to bias the immune state in favor of the regulatory actors - thereby shutting down autoimmune pathways in the response. While there are several known approaches to immunotherapy, the effectiveness of the therapy will depend on how this intervention alters the evolution of this state. Unfortunately, this process is determined not only by the dynamics of the process, but the state of the system at the time of intervention - a state which is difficult if not impossible to determine prior to application of the therapy.

Our goal is to establish theoretical results on the well-posedness of MPOPs that can characterize practically relevant continuous control systems. To do so, we define a special class of MPOPs called Compactly Restrictable MPOPs (CR-MPOPs), which are flexible enough to capture the complex behavior of robotic systems but specific enough to admit solutions using dynamic programming methods such as value iteration. We show how to arrive at CR-MPOPs using forward-invariance. We further show that our theoretical results on CR-MPOPs can be used to characterize feedback linearizable control affine systems.

**Abstract:** Designing efficient general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms that work with large -- or even continuous -- action spaces would facilitate application to important scenarios such as information retrieval, recommendation systems, and continuous control. While obtaining standard regret guarantees can be hopeless, alternative regret notions have been proposed to tackle the large action setting. We propose a smooth regret notion for contextual bandits, which dominates previously proposed alternatives. We design a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm -- for the proposed smooth regret -- that works with general function approximation under standard supervised oracles. We also present an adaptive algorithm that automatically adapts to any smoothness level. Our algorithms can be used to recover the previous minimax/Pareto optimal guarantees under the standard regret, e.g., in bandit problems with multiple best arms and Lipschitz/H{√∂}lder bandits. We conduct large-scale empirical evaluations demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.

**Abstract:** A central problem in sequential decision making is to develop algorithms that are practical and computationally efficient, yet support the use of flexible, general-purpose models. Focusing on the contextual bandit problem, recent progress provides provably efficient algorithms with strong empirical performance when the number of possible alternatives ("actions") is small, but guarantees for decision making in large, continuous action spaces have remained elusive, leading to a significant gap between theory and practice. We present the first efficient, general-purpose algorithm for contextual bandits with continuous, linearly structured action spaces. Our algorithm makes use of computational oracles for (i) supervised learning, and (ii) optimization over the action space, and achieves sample complexity, runtime, and memory independent of the size of the action space. In addition, it is simple and practical. We perform a large-scale empirical evaluation, and show that our approach typically enjoys superior performance and efficiency compared to standard baselines.

**Abstract:** The popularity of machine learning has increased the risk of unfair models getting deployed in high-stake applications, such as justice system, drug/vaccination design, and medical diagnosis. Although there are effective methods to train fair models from scratch, how to automatically reveal and explain the unfairness of a trained model remains a challenging task. Revealing unfairness of machine learning models in interpretable fashion is a critical step towards fair and trustworthy AI. In this paper, we systematically tackle the novel task of revealing unfair models by mining interpretable evidence (RUMIE). The key idea is to find solid evidence in the form of a group of data instances discriminated most by the model. To make the evidence interpretable, we also find a set of human-understandable key attributes and decision rules that characterize the discriminated data instances and distinguish them from the other non-discriminated data. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on many real-world data sets, our method finds highly interpretable and solid evidence to effectively reveal the unfairness of trained models. Moreover, it is much more scalable than all of the baseline methods.

**Abstract:** Fast approximations to matrix multiplication have the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of neural network inference. Recent work on approximate matrix multiplication proposed to replace costly multiplications with table-lookups by fitting a fast hash function from training data. In this work, we propose improvements to this previous work, targeted to the deep learning inference setting, where one has access to both training data and fixed (already learned) model weight matrices. We further propose a fine-tuning procedure for accelerating entire neural networks while minimizing loss in accuracy. Finally, we analyze the proposed method on a simple image classification task. While we show improvements to prior work, overall classification accuracy remains substantially diminished compared to exact matrix multiplication. Our work, despite this negative result, points the way towards future efforts to accelerate inner products with fast nonlinear hashing methods.

**Abstract:** Following work on joint object-action representations, functional object-oriented networks (FOON) were introduced as a knowledge graph representation for robots. Taking the form of a bipartite graph, a FOON contains symbolic (high-level) concepts useful to a robot's understanding of tasks and its environment for object-level planning. Prior to this paper, little has been done to demonstrate how task plans acquired from FOON via task tree retrieval can be executed by a robot, as the concepts in a FOON are too abstract for immediate execution. We propose a hierarchical task planning approach that translates a FOON graph into a PDDL-based representation of domain knowledge for manipulation planning. As a result of this process, a task plan can be acquired that a robot can execute from start to end, leveraging the use of action contexts and skills in the form of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). We demonstrate the entire pipeline from planning to execution using CoppeliaSim and show how learned action contexts can be extended to never-before-seen scenarios.

**Abstract:** This work introduces BRILLsson, a novel binary neural network-based representation learning model for a broad range of non-semantic speech tasks. We train the model with knowledge distillation from a large and real-valued TRILLsson model with only a fraction of the dataset used to train TRILLsson. The resulting BRILLsson models are only 2MB in size with a latency less than 8ms, making them suitable for deployment in low-resource devices such as wearables. We evaluate BRILLsson on eight benchmark tasks (including but not limited to spoken language identification, emotion recognition, heath condition diagnosis, and keyword spotting), and demonstrate that our proposed ultra-light and low-latency models perform as well as large-scale models.

**Abstract:** A counter-intuitive property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their inherent susceptibility to adversarial examples, which severely hinders the application of CNNs in security-critical fields. Adversarial examples are similar to original examples but contain malicious perturbations. Adversarial training is a simple and effective training method to improve the robustness of CNNs to adversarial examples. The mechanisms behind adversarial examples and adversarial training are worth exploring. Therefore, this work investigates similarities and differences between two types of CNNs (both normal and robust ones) in information extraction by observing the trends towards the mutual information. We show that 1) the amount of mutual information that CNNs extract from original and adversarial examples is almost similar, whether CNNs are in normal training or adversarial training; the reason why adversarial examples mislead CNNs may be that they contain more texture-based information about other categories; 2) compared with normal training, adversarial training is more difficult and the amount of information extracted by the robust CNNs is less; 3) the CNNs trained with different methods have different preferences for certain types of information; normally trained CNNs tend to extract texture-based information from the inputs, while adversarially trained models prefer to shape-based information. Furthermore, we also analyze the mutual information estimators used in this work, kernel-density-estimation and binning methods, and find that these estimators outline the geometric properties of the middle layer's output to a certain extent.

**Abstract:** Software fault-proneness prediction is an active research area, with many factors affecting prediction performance extensively studied. However, the impact of the learning approach (i.e., the specifics of the data used for training and the target variable being predicted) on the prediction performance has not been studied, except for one initial work. This paper explores the effects of two learning approaches, useAllPredictAll and usePrePredictPost, on the performance of software fault-proneness prediction, both within-release and across-releases. The empirical results are based on data extracted from 64 releases of twelve open-source projects. Results show that the learning approach has a substantial, and typically unacknowledged, impact on the classification performance. Specifically, using useAllPredictAll leads to significantly better performance than using usePrePredictPost learning approach, both within-release and across-releases. Furthermore, this paper uncovers that, for within-release predictions, this difference in classification performance is due to different levels of class imbalance in the two learning approaches. When class imbalance is addressed, the performance difference between the learning approaches is eliminated. Our findings imply that the learning approach should always be explicitly identified and its impact on software fault-proneness prediction considered. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential consequences of our results for both research and practice.

**Abstract:** Learning dynamic user preference has become an increasingly important component for many online platforms (e.g., video-sharing sites, e-commerce systems) to make sequential recommendations. Previous works have made many efforts to model item-item transitions over user interaction sequences, based on various architectures, e.g., recurrent neural networks and self-attention mechanism. Recently emerged graph neural networks also serve as useful backbone models to capture item dependencies in sequential recommendation scenarios. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods have far focused on item sequence representation with singular type of interactions, and thus are limited to capture dynamic heterogeneous relational structures between users and items (e.g., page view, add-to-favorite, purchase). To tackle this challenge, we design a Multi-Behavior Hypergraph-enhanced Transformer framework (MBHT) to capture both short-term and long-term cross-type behavior dependencies. Specifically, a multi-scale Transformer is equipped with low-rank self-attention to jointly encode behavior-aware sequential patterns from fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. Additionally, we incorporate the global multi-behavior dependency into the hypergraph neural architecture to capture the hierarchical long-range item correlations in a customized manner. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our MBHT over various state-of-the-art recommendation solutions across different settings. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the new MBHT framework. Our implementation code is released at: https://github.com/yuh-yang/MBHT-KDD22.

**Abstract:** We present a new scheme to compensate for the small-scales approximations resulting from Particle-Mesh (PM) schemes for cosmological N-body simulations. This kind of simulations are fast and low computational cost realizations of the large scale structures, but lack resolution on small scales. To improve their accuracy, we introduce an additional effective force within the differential equations of the simulation, parameterized by a Fourier-space Neural Network acting on the PM-estimated gravitational potential. We compare the results for the matter power spectrum obtained to the ones obtained by the PGD scheme (Potential gradient descent scheme). We notice a similar improvement in term of power spectrum, but we find that our approach outperforms PGD for the cross-correlation coefficients, and is more robust to changes in simulation settings (different resolutions, different cosmologies).

**Abstract:** NeuroEvolution automates the generation of Artificial Neural Networks through the application of techniques from Evolutionary Computation. The main goal of these approaches is to build models that maximize predictive performance, sometimes with an additional objective of minimizing computational complexity. Although the evolved models achieve competitive results performance-wise, their robustness to adversarial examples, which becomes a concern in security-critical scenarios, has received limited attention. In this paper, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of models found by two prominent NeuroEvolution approaches on the CIFAR-10 image classification task: DENSER and NSGA-Net. Since the models are publicly available, we consider white-box untargeted attacks, where the perturbations are bounded by either the L2 or the Linfinity-norm. Similarly to manually-designed networks, our results show that when the evolved models are attacked with iterative methods, their accuracy usually drops to, or close to, zero under both distance metrics. The DENSER model is an exception to this trend, showing some resistance under the L2 threat model, where its accuracy only drops from 93.70% to 18.10% even with iterative attacks. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of pre-processing applied to the data before the first layer of the network. Our observations suggest that some of these techniques can exacerbate the perturbations added to the original inputs, potentially harming robustness. Thus, this choice should not be neglected when automatically designing networks for applications where adversarial attacks are prone to occur.

**Abstract:** Wound image segmentation is a critical component for the clinical diagnosis and in-time treatment of wounds. Recently, deep learning has become the mainstream methodology for wound image segmentation. However, the pre-processing of the wound image, such as the illumination correction, is required before the training phase as the performance can be greatly improved. The correction procedure and the training of deep models are independent of each other, which leads to sub-optimal segmentation performance as the fixed illumination correction may not be suitable for all images. To address aforementioned issues, an end-to-end dual-view segmentation approach was proposed in this paper, by incorporating a learn-able illumination correction module into the deep segmentation models. The parameters of the module can be learned and updated during the training stage automatically, while the dual-view fusion can fully employ the features from both the raw images and the enhanced ones. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, the extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets. The encouraging results suggest that our framework can significantly improve the segmentation performance, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely searched problem in recommender systems. Linear autoencoder is a kind of well-established method for CF, which estimates item-item relations through encoding user-item interactions. Despite the excellent performance of linear autoencoders, the rapidly increasing computational and storage costs caused by the growing number of items limit their scalabilities in large-scale real-world scenarios. Recently, graph-based approaches have achieved success on CF with high scalability, and have been shown to have commonalities with linear autoencoders in user-item interaction modeling. Motivated by this, we propose an efficient and scalable recommendation via item-item graph partitioning (ERGP), aiming to address the limitations of linear autoencoders. In particular, a recursive graph partitioning strategy is proposed to ensure that the item set is divided into several partitions of finite size. Linear autoencoders encode user-item interactions within partitions while preserving global information across the entire item set. This allows ERGP to have guaranteed efficiency and high scalability when the number of items increases. Experiments conducted on 3 public datasets and 3 open benchmarking datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ERGP, which outperforms state-of-the-art models with lower training time and storage costs.

**Abstract:** For neural video codec, it is critical, yet challenging, to design an efficient entropy model which can accurately predict the probability distribution of the quantized latent representation. However, most existing video codecs directly use the ready-made entropy model from image codec to encode the residual or motion, and do not fully leverage the spatial-temporal characteristics in video. To this end, this paper proposes a powerful entropy model which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. In particular, we introduce the latent prior which exploits the correlation among the latent representation to squeeze the temporal redundancy. Meanwhile, the dual spatial prior is proposed to reduce the spatial redundancy in a parallel-friendly manner. In addition, our entropy model is also versatile. Besides estimating the probability distribution, our entropy model also generates the quantization step at spatial-channel-wise. This content-adaptive quantization mechanism not only helps our codec achieve the smooth rate adjustment in single model but also improves the final rate-distortion performance by dynamic bit allocation. Experimental results show that, powered by the proposed entropy model, our neural codec can achieve 18.2% bitrate saving on UVG dataset when compared with H.266 (VTM) using the highest compression ratio configuration. It makes a new milestone in the development of neural video codec. The codes are at https://github.com/microsoft/DCVC.

**Abstract:** Deep MRI reconstruction is commonly performed with conditional models that map undersampled data as input onto fully-sampled data as output. Conditional models perform de-aliasing under knowledge of the accelerated imaging operator, so they poorly generalize under domain shifts in the operator. Unconditional models are a powerful alternative that instead learn generative image priors to improve reliability against domain shifts. Recent diffusion models are particularly promising given their high representational diversity and sample quality. Nevertheless, projections through a static image prior can lead to suboptimal performance. Here we propose a novel MRI reconstruction, AdaDiff, based on an adaptive diffusion prior. To enable efficient image sampling, an adversarial mapper is introduced that enables use of large diffusion steps. A two-phase reconstruction is performed with the trained prior: a rapid-diffusion phase that produces an initial reconstruction, and an adaptation phase where the diffusion prior is updated to minimize reconstruction loss on acquired k-space data. Demonstrations on multi-contrast brain MRI clearly indicate that AdaDiff achieves superior performance to competing models in cross-domain tasks, and superior or on par performance in within-domain tasks.

**Abstract:** Reservoir computers (RCs) are among the fastest to train of all neural networks, especially when they are compared to other recurrent neural networks. RC has this advantage while still handling sequential data exceptionally well. However, RC adoption has lagged other neural network models because of the model's sensitivity to its hyper-parameters (HPs). A modern unified software package that automatically tunes these parameters is missing from the literature. Manually tuning these numbers is very difficult, and the cost of traditional grid search methods grows exponentially with the number of HPs considered, discouraging the use of the RC and limiting the complexity of the RC models which can be devised. We address these problems by introducing RcTorch, a PyTorch based RC neural network package with automated HP tuning. Herein, we demonstrate the utility of RcTorch by using it to predict the complex dynamics of a driven pendulum being acted upon by varying forces. This work includes coding examples. Example Python Jupyter notebooks can be found on our GitHub repository https://github.com/blindedjoy/RcTorch and documentation can be found at https://rctorch.readthedocs.io/.

**Abstract:** Machine learning is considered to be one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Therefore, the search for quantum advantage of the quantum analogues of machine learning models is a key research goal. Here, we show that variational quantum classifiers (VQC) and support vector machines with quantum kernels (QSVM) can solve a classification problem based on the k-Forrelation problem, which is known to be PromiseBQP-complete. Because the PromiseBQP complexity class includes all Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time (BQP) decision problems, our results imply that there exists a feature map and a quantum kernel that make VQC and QSVM efficient solvers for any BQP problem. This means that the feature map of VQC or the quantum kernel of QSVM can be designed to have quantum advantage for any classification problem that cannot be classically solved in polynomial time but contrariwise by a quantum computer.

**Abstract:** Human services systems make key decisions that impact individuals in the society. The U.S. child welfare system makes such decisions, from screening-in hotline reports of suspected abuse or neglect for child protective investigations, placing children in foster care, to returning children to permanent home settings. These complex and impactful decisions on children's lives rely on the judgment of child welfare decisionmakers. Child welfare agencies have been exploring ways to support these decisions with empirical, data-informed methods that include machine learning (ML). This paper describes a conceptual framework for ML to support child welfare decisions. The ML framework guides how child welfare agencies might conceptualize a target problem that ML can solve; vet available administrative data for building ML; formulate and develop ML specifications that mirror relevant populations and interventions the agencies are undertaking; deploy, evaluate, and monitor ML as child welfare context, policy, and practice change over time. Ethical considerations, stakeholder engagement, and avoidance of common pitfalls underpin the framework's impact and success. From abstract to concrete, we describe one application of this framework to support a child welfare decision. This ML framework, though child welfare-focused, is generalizable to solving other public policy problems.

**Abstract:** Generalizing machine learning (ML) models for network traffic dynamics tends to be considered a lost cause. Hence, for every new task, we often resolve to design new models and train them on model-specific datasets collected, whenever possible, in an environment mimicking the model's deployment. This approach essentially gives up on generalization. Yet, an ML architecture called_Transformer_ has enabled previously unimaginable generalization in other domains. Nowadays, one can download a model pre-trained on massive datasets and only fine-tune it for a specific task and context with comparatively little time and data. These fine-tuned models are now state-of-the-art for many benchmarks.
  We believe this progress could translate to networking and propose a Network Traffic Transformer (NTT), a transformer adapted to learn network dynamics from packet traces. Our initial results are promising: NTT seems able to generalize to new prediction tasks and contexts. This study suggests there is still hope for generalization, though it calls for a lot of future research.

**Abstract:** We present an Equation/Variable free machine learning (EVFML) framework for the control of the collective dynamics of complex/multiscale systems modelled via microscopic/agent-based simulators. The approach obviates the need for construction of surrogate, reduced-order models.~The proposed implementation consists of three steps: (A) from high-dimensional agent-based simulations, machine learning (in particular, non-linear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps (DMs)) helps identify a set of coarse-grained variables that parametrize the low-dimensional manifold on which the emergent/collective dynamics evolve. The out-of-sample extension and pre-image problems, i.e. the construction of non-linear mappings from the high-dimensional input space to the low-dimensional manifold and back, are solved by coupling DMs with the Nystrom extension and Geometric Harmonics, respectively; (B) having identified the manifold and its coordinates, we exploit the Equation-free approach to perform numerical bifurcation analysis of the emergent dynamics; then (C) based on the previous steps, we design data-driven embedded wash-out controllers that drive the agent-based simulators to their intrinsic, imprecisely known, emergent open-loop unstable steady-states, thus demonstrating that the scheme is robust against numerical approximation errors and modelling uncertainty.~The efficiency of the framework is illustrated by controlling emergent unstable (i) traveling waves of a deterministic agent-based model of traffic dynamics, and (ii) equilibria of a stochastic financial market agent model with mimesis.

**Abstract:** Transfer learning, or domain adaptation, is concerned with machine learning problems in which training and testing data come from possibly different probability distributions. In this work, we give an information-theoretic analysis on the generalization error and excess risk of transfer learning algorithms, following a line of work initiated by Russo and Xu. Our results suggest, perhaps as expected, that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $D(Œº||Œº')$ plays an important role in the characterizations where $Œº$ and $Œº'$ denote the distribution of the training data and the testing test, respectively. Specifically, we provide generalization error upper bounds for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm where data from both distributions are available in the training phase. We further apply the analysis to approximated ERM methods such as the Gibbs algorithm and the stochastic gradient descent method. We then generalize the mutual information bound with $œÜ$-divergence and Wasserstein distance. These generalizations lead to tighter bounds and can handle the case when $Œº$ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $Œº'$. Furthermore, we apply a new set of techniques to obtain an alternative upper bound which gives a fast (and optimal) learning rate for some learning problems. Finally, inspired by the derived bounds, we propose the InfoBoost algorithm in which the importance weights for source and target data are adjusted adaptively in accordance to information measures. The empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

**Abstract:** Deep learning (DL) techniques have been intensively studied for the optimization of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink systems owing to the capability of handling nonconvex formulations. However, the fixed computation structure of existing deep neural networks (DNNs) lacks flexibility with respect to the system size, i.e., the number of antennas or users. This paper develops a bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) framework, a scalable DL solution designed for multi-antenna beamforming optimization. The MU-MISO system is first characterized by a bipartite graph where two disjoint vertex sets, each of which consists of transmit antennas and users, are connected via pairwise edges. These vertex interconnection states are modeled by channel fading coefficients. Thus, a generic beamforming optimization process is interpreted as a computation task over a weight bipartite graph. This approach partitions the beamforming optimization procedure into multiple suboperations dedicated to individual antenna vertices and user vertices. Separated vertex operations lead to scalable beamforming calculations that are invariant to the system size. The vertex operations are realized by a group of DNN modules that collectively form the BGNN architecture. Identical DNNs are reused at all antennas and users so that the resultant learning structure becomes flexible to the network size. Component DNNs of the BGNN are trained jointly over numerous MU-MISO configurations with randomly varying network sizes. As a result, the trained BGNN can be universally applied to arbitrary MU-MISO systems. Numerical results validate the advantages of the BGNN framework over conventional methods.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have been found vulnerable to adversarial attacks, thus raising potentially concerns in security-sensitive contexts. To address this problem, recent research has investigated the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks from the architectural point of view. However, searching for architectures of deep neural networks is computationally expensive, particularly when coupled with adversarial training process. To meet the above challenge, this paper proposes a bi-fidelity multiobjective neural architecture search approach. First, we formulate the NAS problem for enhancing adversarial robustness of deep neural networks into a multiobjective optimization problem. Specifically, in addition to a low-fidelity performance predictor as the first objective, we leverage an auxiliary-objective -- the value of which is the output of a surrogate model trained with high-fidelity evaluations. Secondly, we reduce the computational cost by combining three performance estimation methods, i.e., parameter sharing, low-fidelity evaluation, and surrogate-based predictor. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets.

**Abstract:** Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance. It is being broadly used to monitor ecosystems, mainly for their preservation. Ever-growing reports of invasive species have affected the natural balance of ecosystems. Exotic invasive species have a critical impact when introduced into new ecosystems and may lead to the extinction of native species. In this study, we focus on Ludwigia peploides, considered by the European Union as an aquatic invasive species. Its presence can negatively impact the surrounding ecosystem and human activities such as agriculture, fishing, and navigation. Our goal was to develop a method to identify the presence of the species. We used images collected by a drone-mounted multispectral sensor to achieve this, creating our LudVision data set. To identify the targeted species on the collected images, we propose a new method for detecting Ludwigia p. in multispectral images. The method is based on existing state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods modified to handle multispectral data. The proposed method achieved a producer's accuracy of 79.9% and a user's accuracy of 95.5%.
