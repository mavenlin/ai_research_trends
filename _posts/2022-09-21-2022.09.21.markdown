**Abstract:** We suggest the first system that runs real-time semantic segmentation via deep learning on a weak micro-computer such as the Raspberry Pi Zero v2 (whose price was \$15) attached to a toy-drone. In particular, since the Raspberry Pi weighs less than $16$ grams, and its size is half of a credit card, we could easily attach it to the common commercial DJI Tello toy-drone (<\$100, <90 grams, 98 $\times$ 92.5 $\times$ 41 mm). The result is an autonomous drone (no laptop nor human in the loop) that can detect and classify objects in real-time from a video stream of an on-board monocular RGB camera (no GPS or LIDAR sensors). The companion videos demonstrate how this Tello drone scans the lab for people (e.g. for the use of firefighters or security forces) and for an empty parking slot outside the lab.
  Existing deep learning solutions are either much too slow for real-time computation on such IoT devices, or provide results of impractical quality. Our main challenge was to design a system that takes the best of all worlds among numerous combinations of networks, deep learning platforms/frameworks, compression techniques, and compression ratios. To this end, we provide an efficient searching algorithm that aims to find the optimal combination which results in the best tradeoff between the network running time and its accuracy/performance.

<p>

**Abstract:** Current abstractive summarization models either suffer from a lack of clear interpretability or provide incomplete rationales by only highlighting parts of the source document. To this end, we propose the Summarization Program (SP), an interpretable modular framework consisting of an (ordered) list of binary trees, each encoding the step-by-step generative process of an abstractive summary sentence from the source document. A Summarization Program contains one root node per summary sentence, and a distinct tree connects each summary sentence (root node) to the document sentences (leaf nodes) from which it is derived, with the connecting nodes containing intermediate generated sentences. Edges represent different modular operations involved in summarization such as sentence fusion, compression, and paraphrasing. We first propose an efficient best-first search method over neural modules, SP-Search that identifies SPs for human summaries by directly optimizing for ROUGE scores. Next, using these programs as automatic supervision, we propose seq2seq models that generate Summarization Programs, which are then executed to obtain final summaries. We demonstrate that SP-Search effectively represents the generative process behind human summaries using modules that are typically faithful to their intended behavior. We also conduct a simulation study to show that Summarization Programs improve the interpretability of summarization models by allowing humans to better simulate model reasoning. Summarization Programs constitute a promising step toward interpretable and modular abstractive summarization, a complex task previously addressed primarily through blackbox end-to-end neural systems.

**Abstract:** Given a portrait image of a person and an environment map of the target lighting, portrait relighting aims to re-illuminate the person in the image as if the person appeared in an environment with the target lighting. To achieve high-quality results, recent methods rely on deep learning. An effective approach is to supervise the training of deep neural networks with a high-fidelity dataset of desired input-output pairs, captured with a light stage. However, acquiring such data requires an expensive special capture rig and time-consuming efforts, limiting access to only a few resourceful laboratories. To address the limitation, we propose a new approach that can perform on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) relighting methods without requiring a light stage. Our approach is based on the realization that a successful relighting of a portrait image depends on two conditions. First, the method needs to mimic the behaviors of physically-based relighting. Second, the output has to be photorealistic. To meet the first condition, we propose to train the relighting network with training data generated by a virtual light stage that performs physically-based rendering on various 3D synthetic humans under different environment maps. To meet the second condition, we develop a novel synthetic-to-real approach to bring photorealism to the relighting network output. In addition to achieving SOTA results, our approach offers several advantages over the prior methods, including controllable glares on glasses and more temporally-consistent results for relighting videos.

**Abstract:** Machine learning potentials are an important tool for molecular simulation, but their development is held back by a shortage of high quality datasets to train them on. We describe the SPICE dataset, a new quantum chemistry dataset for training potentials relevant to simulating drug-like small molecules interacting with proteins. It contains over 1.1 million conformations for a diverse set of small molecules, dimers, dipeptides, and solvated amino acids. It includes 15 elements, charged and uncharged molecules, and a wide range of covalent and non-covalent interactions. It provides both forces and energies calculated at the Ï‰B97M-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPPD level of theory, along with other useful quantities such as multipole moments and bond orders. We train a set of machine learning potentials on it and demonstrate that they can achieve chemical accuracy across a broad region of chemical space. It can serve as a valuable resource for the creation of transferable, ready to use potential functions for use in molecular simulations.

<p>

**Abstract:** This paper tackles recipe generation from unsegmented cooking videos, a task that requires agents to (1) extract key events in completing the dish and (2) generate sentences for the extracted events. Our task is similar to dense video captioning (DVC), which aims at detecting events thoroughly and generating sentences for them. However, unlike DVC, in recipe generation, recipe story awareness is crucial, and a model should output an appropriate number of key events in the correct order. We analyze the output of the DVC model and observe that although (1) several events are adoptable as a recipe story, (2) the generated sentences for such events are not grounded in the visual content. Based on this, we hypothesize that we can obtain correct recipes by selecting oracle events from the output events of the DVC model and re-generating sentences for them. To achieve this, we propose a novel transformer-based joint approach of training event selector and sentence generator for selecting oracle events from the outputs of the DVC model and generating grounded sentences for the events, respectively. In addition, we extend the model by including ingredients to generate more accurate recipes. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art DVC models. We also confirm that, by modeling the recipe in a story-aware manner, the proposed model output the appropriate number of events in the correct order.

**Abstract:** Probabilistic models based on continuous latent spaces, such as variational autoencoders, can be understood as uncountable mixture models where components depend continuously on the latent code. They have proven expressive tools for generative and probabilistic modelling, but are at odds with tractable probabilistic inference, that is, computing marginals and conditionals of the represented probability distribution. Meanwhile, tractable probabilistic models such as probabilistic circuits (PCs) can be understood as hierarchical discrete mixture models, which allows them to perform exact inference, but often they show subpar performance in comparison to continuous latent-space models. In this paper, we investigate a hybrid approach, namely continuous mixtures of tractable models with a small latent dimension. While these models are analytically intractable, they are well amenable to numerical integration schemes based on a finite set of integration points. With a large enough number of integration points the approximation becomes de-facto exact. Moreover, using a finite set of integration points, the approximation method can be compiled into a PC performing `exact inference in an approximate model'. In experiments, we show that this simple scheme proves remarkably effective, as PCs learned this way set new state-of-the-art for tractable models on many standard density estimation benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models pre-trained with self-supervised learning have demonstrated impressive zero-shot generalization capabilities on a wide spectrum of tasks. In this work, we present WeLM: a well-read pre-trained language model for Chinese that is able to seamlessly perform different types of tasks with zero or few-shot demonstrations. WeLM is trained with 10B parameters by "reading" a curated high-quality corpus covering a wide range of topics. We show that WeLM is equipped with broad knowledge on various domains and languages. On 18 monolingual (Chinese) tasks, WeLM can significantly outperform existing pre-trained models with similar sizes and match the performance of models up to 25 times larger. WeLM also exhibits strong capabilities in multi-lingual and code-switching understanding, outperforming existing multilingual language models pre-trained on 30 languages. Furthermore, We collected human-written prompts for a large set of supervised datasets in Chinese and fine-tuned WeLM with multi-prompted training. The resulting model can attain strong generalization on unseen types of tasks and outperform the unsupervised WeLM in zero-shot learning. Finally, we demonstrate that WeLM has basic skills at explaining and calibrating the decisions from itself, which can be promising directions for future research. Our models can be applied from https://welm.weixin.qq.com/docs/api/.

**Abstract:** Asset allocation (or portfolio management) is the task of determining how to optimally allocate funds of a finite budget into a range of financial instruments/assets such as stocks. This study investigated the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) when applied to portfolio management using model-free deep RL agents. We trained several RL agents on real-world stock prices to learn how to perform asset allocation. We compared the performance of these RL agents against some baseline agents. We also compared the RL agents among themselves to understand which classes of agents performed better. From our analysis, RL agents can perform the task of portfolio management since they significantly outperformed two of the baseline agents (random allocation and uniform allocation). Four RL agents (A2C, SAC, PPO, and TRPO) outperformed the best baseline, MPT, overall. This shows the abilities of RL agents to uncover more profitable trading strategies. Furthermore, there were no significant performance differences between value-based and policy-based RL agents. Actor-critic agents performed better than other types of agents. Also, on-policy agents performed better than off-policy agents because they are better at policy evaluation and sample efficiency is not a significant problem in portfolio management. This study shows that RL agents can substantially improve asset allocation since they outperform strong baselines. On-policy, actor-critic RL agents showed the most promise based on our analysis.

**Abstract:** With the rising participation of the common mass in social media, it is increasingly common now for policymakers/journalists to create online polls on social media to understand the political leanings of people in specific locations. The caveat here is that only influential people can make such an online polling and reach out at a mass scale. Further, in such cases, the distribution of voters is not controllable and may be, in fact, biased. On the other hand,if we can interpret the publicly available data over social media to probe the political inclination of users, we will be able to have controllable insights about the survey population, keep the cost of survey low and also collect publicly available data without involving the concerned persons. Hence we introduce a self-attentive semi-supervised framework for political inclination detection to further that objective. The advantage of our model is that it neither needs huge training data nor does it need to store social network parameters. Nevertheless, it achieves an accuracy of 93.7\% with no annotated data; further, with only a few annotated examples per class it achieves competitive performance.
  We found that the model is highly efficient even in resource-constrained settings, and insights drawn from its predictions match the manual survey outcomes when applied to diverse real-life scenarios.

**Abstract:** Word Error Rate (WER) is the primary metric used to assess automatic speech recognition (ASR) model quality. It has been shown that ASR models tend to have much higher WER on speakers with speech impairments than typical English speakers. It is hard to determine if models can be be useful at such high error rates. This study investigates the use of BERTScore, an evaluation metric for text generation, to provide a more informative measure of ASR model quality and usefulness. Both BERTScore and WER were compared to prediction errors manually annotated by Speech Language Pathologists for error type and assessment. BERTScore was found to be more correlated with human assessment of error type and assessment. BERTScore was specifically more robust to orthographic changes (contraction and normalization errors) where meaning was preserved. Furthermore, BERTScore was a better fit of error assessment than WER, as measured using an ordinal logistic regression and the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Overall, our findings suggest that BERTScore can complement WER when assessing ASR model performance from a practical perspective, especially for accessibility applications where models are useful even at lower accuracy than for typical speech.

<p>

**Abstract:** Video conferencing systems suffer from poor user experience when network conditions deteriorate because current video codecs simply cannot operate at extremely low bitrates. Recently, several neural alternatives have been proposed that reconstruct talking head videos at very low bitrates using sparse representations of each frame such as facial landmark information. However, these approaches produce poor reconstructions in scenarios with major movement or occlusions over the course of a call, and do not scale to higher resolutions. We design Gemino, a new neural compression system for video conferencing based on a novel high-frequency-conditional super-resolution pipeline. Gemino upsamples a very low-resolution version of each target frame while enhancing high-frequency details (e.g., skin texture, hair, etc.) based on information extracted from a single high-resolution reference image. We use a multi-scale architecture that runs different components of the model at different resolutions, allowing it to scale to resolutions comparable to 720p, and we personalize the model to learn specific details of each person, achieving much better fidelity at low bitrates. We implement Gemino atop aiortc, an open-source Python implementation of WebRTC, and show that it operates on 1024x1024 videos in real-time on a A100 GPU, and achieves 2.9x lower bitrate than traditional video codecs for the same perceptual quality.

**Abstract:** In neural networks, task-relevant information is represented jointly by groups of neurons. However, the specific way in which the information is distributed among the individual neurons is not well understood: While parts of it may only be obtainable from specific single neurons, other parts are carried redundantly or synergistically by multiple neurons. We show how Partial Information Decomposition (PID), a recent extension of information theory, can disentangle these contributions. From this, we introduce the measure of "Representational Complexity", which quantifies the difficulty of accessing information spread across multiple neurons. We show how this complexity is directly computable for smaller layers. For larger layers, we propose subsampling and coarse-graining procedures and prove corresponding bounds on the latter. Empirically, for quantized deep neural networks solving the MNIST task, we observe that representational complexity decreases both through successive hidden layers and over training. Overall, we propose representational complexity as a principled and interpretable summary statistic for analyzing the structure of neural representations.

<p>

**Abstract:** Graph-to-text (G2T) generation and text-to-graph (T2G) triple extraction are two essential tasks for constructing and applying knowledge graphs. Existing unsupervised approaches turn out to be suitable candidates for jointly learning the two tasks due to their avoidance of using graph-text parallel data. However, they are composed of multiple modules and still require both entity information and relation type in the training process. To this end, we propose INFINITY, a simple yet effective unsupervised approach that does not require external annotation tools or additional parallel information. It achieves fully unsupervised graph-text mutual conversion for the first time. Specifically, INFINITY treats both G2T and T2G as a bidirectional sequence generation task by fine-tuning only one pretrained seq2seq model. A novel back-translation-based framework is then designed to automatically generate continuous synthetic parallel data. To obtain reasonable graph sequences with structural information from source texts, INFINITY employs reward-based training loss by leveraging the advantage of reward augmented maximum likelihood. As a fully unsupervised framework, INFINITY is empirically verified to outperform state-of-the-art baselines for G2T and T2G tasks.

**Abstract:** Three problems exist in sequential facial image editing: incontinuous editing, inconsistent editing, and irreversible editing. Incontinuous editing is that the current editing can not retain the previously edited attributes. Inconsistent editing is that swapping the attribute editing orders can not yield the same results. Irreversible editing means that operating on a facial image is irreversible, especially in sequential facial image editing. In this work, we put forward three concepts and corresponding definitions: editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. Then, we propose a novel model to achieve the goal of editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. A sufficient criterion is defined to determine whether a model is continuous, consistent, and reversible. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results validate our proposed model and show that a continuous, consistent and reversible editing model has a more flexible editing function while preserving facial identity. Furthermore, we think that our proposed definitions and model will have wide and promising applications in multimedia processing. Code and data are available at https://github.com/mickoluan/CCR.

**Abstract:** There is a substantial and ever-growing corpus of evidence and literature exploring the impacts of Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on society, politics, and humanity as a whole. A separate, parallel body of work has explored existential risks to humanity, including but not limited to that stemming from unaligned Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). In this paper, we problematise the notion that current and near-term artificial intelligence technologies have the potential to contribute to existential risk by acting as intermediate risk factors, and that this potential is not limited to the unaligned AGI scenario. We propose the hypothesis that certain already-documented effects of AI can act as existential risk factors, magnifying the likelihood of previously identified sources of existential risk. Moreover, future developments in the coming decade hold the potential to significantly exacerbate these risk factors, even in the absence of artificial general intelligence. Our main contribution is a (non-exhaustive) exposition of potential AI risk factors and the causal relationships between them, focusing on how AI can affect power dynamics and information security. This exposition demonstrates that there exist causal pathways from AI systems to existential risks that do not presuppose hypothetical future AI capabilities.

**Abstract:** Considering the functionality of situational awareness in safety-critical automation systems, the perception of risk in driving scenes and its explainability is of particular importance for autonomous and cooperative driving. Toward this goal, this paper proposes a new research direction of joint risk localization in driving scenes and its risk explanation as a natural language description. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks, we collected a large-scale dataset, DRAMA (Driving Risk Assessment Mechanism with A captioning module), which consists of 17,785 interactive driving scenarios collected in Tokyo, Japan. Our DRAMA dataset accommodates video- and object-level questions on driving risks with associated important objects to achieve the goal of visual captioning as a free-form language description utilizing closed and open-ended responses for multi-level questions, which can be used to evaluate a range of visual captioning capabilities in driving scenarios. We make this data available to the community for further research. Using DRAMA, we explore multiple facets of joint risk localization and captioning in interactive driving scenarios. In particular, we benchmark various multi-task prediction architectures and provide a detailed analysis of joint risk localization and risk captioning.

**Abstract:** Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithms have shown remarkable success in applications involving expensive black-box functions. Traditionally BO has been set as a sequential decision-making process which estimates the utility of query points via an acquisition function and a prior over functions, such as a Gaussian process. Recently, however, a reformulation of BO via density-ratio estimation (BORE) allowed reinterpreting the acquisition function as a probabilistic binary classifier, removing the need for an explicit prior over functions and increasing scalability. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of BORE's regret and an extension of the algorithm with improved uncertainty estimates. We also show that BORE can be naturally extended to a batch optimisation setting by recasting the problem as approximate Bayesian inference. The resulting algorithm comes equipped with theoretical performance guarantees and is assessed against other batch BO baselines in a series of experiments.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from a number of noisy random linear measurements. We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a prior and use an overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground-truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix variable, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when stop appropriately. We then propose an efficient early stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.

**Abstract:** The vector autoregressive (VAR) model has been used to describe the dependence within and across multiple time series. This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.

**Abstract:** The process of obtaining high-resolution images from single or multiple low-resolution images of the same scene is of great interest for real-world image and signal processing applications. This study is about exploring the potential usage of deep learning based image super-resolution algorithms on thermal data for producing high quality thermal imaging results for in-cabin vehicular driver monitoring systems. In this work we have proposed and developed a novel multi-image super-resolution recurrent neural network to enhance the resolution and improve the quality of low-resolution thermal imaging data captured from uncooled thermal cameras. The end-to-end fully convolutional neural network is trained from scratch on newly acquired thermal data of 30 different subjects in indoor environmental conditions. The effectiveness of the thermally tuned super-resolution network is validated quantitatively as well as qualitatively on test data of 6 distinct subjects. The network was able to achieve a mean peak signal to noise ratio of 39.24 on the validation dataset for 4x super-resolution, outperforming bicubic interpolation both quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract:** Deep learning has led to great progress in the detection of mobile (i.e. movement-capable) objects in urban driving scenes in recent years. Supervised approaches typically require the annotation of large training sets; there has thus been great interest in leveraging weakly, semi- or self-supervised methods to avoid this, with much success. Whilst weakly and semi-supervised methods require some annotation, self-supervised methods have used cues such as motion to relieve the need for annotation altogether. However, a complete absence of annotation typically degrades their performance, and ambiguities that arise during motion grouping can inhibit their ability to find accurate object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised mobile object detection approach called SCT. This uses both motion cues and expected object sizes to improve detection performance, and predicts a dense grid of 3D oriented bounding boxes to improve object discovery. We significantly outperform the state-of-the-art self-supervised mobile object detection method TCR on the KITTI tracking benchmark, and achieve performance that is within 30% of the fully supervised PV-RCNN++ method for IoUs <= 0.5.

**Abstract:** Deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has attracted appealing attention in academic researches and clinical applications. Nevertheless, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) diagnosis system heavily relies on the well-labeled lesion dataset, and the sensitivity to the variation of data distribution also restricts the potential application of CNNs in CAD. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are developed to solve the expensive annotation and domain gaps problem and have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis. Yet existing UDA approaches only adapt knowledge learned from the source lesion domain to a single target lesion domain, which is against the clinical scenario: the new unlabeled target domains to be diagnosed always arrive in an online and continual manner. Moreover, the performance of existing approaches degrades dramatically on previously learned target lesion domains, due to the newly learned knowledge overwriting the previously learned knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). To deal with the above issues, we develop a meta-adaptation framework named Consecutive Lesion Knowledge Meta-Adaptation (CLKM), which mainly consists of Semantic Adaptation Phase (SAP) and Representation Adaptation Phase (RAP) to learn the diagnosis model in an online and continual manner. In the SAP, the semantic knowledge learned from the source lesion domain is transferred to consecutive target lesion domains. In the RAP, the feature-extractor is optimized to align the transferable representation knowledge across the source and multiple target lesion domains.

**Abstract:** Although deep learning has made significant impact on image/video restoration and super-resolution, learned deinterlacing has so far received less attention in academia or industry. This is despite deinterlacing is well-suited for supervised learning from synthetic data since the degradation model is known and fixed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-field full frame-rate deinterlacing network, which adapts the state-of-the-art superresolution approaches to the deinterlacing task. Our model aligns features from adjacent fields to a reference field (to be deinterlaced) using both deformable convolution residual blocks and self attention. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides state-of-the-art deinterlacing results in terms of both numerical and perceptual performance. At the time of writing, our model ranks first in the Full FrameRate LeaderBoard at https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/deinterlacer.html

**Abstract:** Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most common symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system impacting millions of people around the world. To address the pressing need to improve the quality of treatment for FoG, devising a computer-aided detection and quantification tool for FoG has been increasingly important. As a non-invasive technique for collecting motion patterns, the footstep pressure sequences obtained from pressure sensitive gait mats provide a great opportunity for evaluating FoG in the clinic and potentially in the home environment. In this study, FoG detection is formulated as a sequential modelling task and a novel deep learning architecture, namely Adversarial Spatio-temporal Network (ASTN), is proposed to learn FoG patterns across multiple levels. A novel adversarial training scheme is introduced with a multi-level subject discriminator to obtain subject-independent FoG representations, which helps to reduce the over-fitting risk due to the high inter-subject variance. As a result, robust FoG detection can be achieved for unseen subjects. The proposed scheme also sheds light on improving subject-level clinical studies from other scenarios as it can be integrated with many existing deep architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies of footstep pressure-based FoG detection and the approach of utilizing ASTN is the first deep neural network architecture in pursuit of subject-independent representations. Experimental results on 393 trials collected from 21 subjects demonstrate encouraging performance of the proposed ASTN for FoG detection with an AUC 0.85.

**Abstract:** Deep learning based image quality assessment (IQA) models usually learn to predict image quality from a single dataset, leading the model to overfit specific scenes. To account for this, mixed datasets training can be an effective way to enhance the generalization capability of the model. However, it is nontrivial to combine different IQA datasets, as their quality evaluation criteria, score ranges, view conditions, as well as subjects are usually not shared during the image quality annotation. In this paper, instead of aligning the annotations, we propose a monotonic neural network for IQA model learning with different datasets combined. In particular, our model consists of a dataset-shared quality regressor and several dataset-specific quality transformers. The quality regressor aims to obtain the perceptual qualities of each dataset while each quality transformer maps the perceptual qualities to the corresponding dataset annotations with their monotonicity maintained. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategy and our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/MonotonicIQA.

**Abstract:** Addressing such diverse ends as safety alignment with human preferences, and the efficiency of learning, a growing line of reinforcement learning research focuses on risk functionals that depend on the entire distribution of returns. Recent work on \emph{off-policy risk assessment} (OPRA) for contextual bandits introduced consistent estimators for the target policy's CDF of returns along with finite sample guarantees that extend to (and hold simultaneously over) all risk. In this paper, we lift OPRA to Markov decision processes (MDPs), where importance sampling (IS) CDF estimators suffer high variance on longer trajectories due to small effective sample size. To mitigate these problems, we incorporate model-based estimation to develop the first doubly robust (DR) estimator for the CDF of returns in MDPs. This estimator enjoys significantly less variance and, when the model is well specified, achieves the Cramer-Rao variance lower bound. Moreover, for many risk functionals, the downstream estimates enjoy both lower bias and lower variance. Additionally, we derive the first minimax lower bounds for off-policy CDF and risk estimation, which match our error bounds up to a constant factor. Finally, we demonstrate the precision of our DR CDF estimates experimentally on several different environments.

**Abstract:** Partial-label learning (PLL) is a peculiar weakly-supervised learning task where the training samples are generally associated with a set of candidate labels instead of single ground truth. While a variety of label disambiguation methods have been proposed in this domain, they normally assume a class-balanced scenario that may not hold in many real-world applications. Empirically, we observe degenerated performance of the prior methods when facing the combinatorial challenge from the long-tailed distribution and partial-labeling. In this work, we first identify the major reasons that the prior work failed. We subsequently propose SoLar, a novel Optimal Transport-based framework that allows to refine the disambiguated labels towards matching the marginal class prior distribution. SoLar additionally incorporates a new and systematic mechanism for estimating the long-tailed class prior distribution under the PLL setup. Through extensive experiments, SoLar exhibits substantially superior results on standardized benchmarks compared to the previous state-of-the-art PLL methods. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/hbzju/SoLar .

**Abstract:** Data-free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has attracted attention recently thanks to its appealing capability of transferring knowledge from a teacher network to a student network without using training data. The main idea is to use a generator to synthesize data for training the student. As the generator gets updated, the distribution of synthetic data will change. Such distribution shift could be large if the generator and the student are trained adversarially, causing the student to forget the knowledge it acquired at previous steps. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method called Momentum Adversarial Distillation (MAD) which maintains an exponential moving average (EMA) copy of the generator and uses synthetic samples from both the generator and the EMA generator to train the student. Since the EMA generator can be considered as an ensemble of the generator's old versions and often undergoes a smaller change in updates compared to the generator, training on its synthetic samples can help the student recall the past knowledge and prevent the student from adapting too quickly to new updates of the generator. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets including big datasets like ImageNet and Places365 demonstrate the superior performance of MAD over competing methods for handling the large distribution shift problem. Our method also compares favorably to existing DFKD methods and even achieves state-of-the-art results in some cases.

**Abstract:** Most automatic emotion recognition systems exploit time-continuous annotations of emotion to provide fine-grained descriptions of spontaneous expressions as observed in real-life interactions. As emotion is rather subjective, its annotation is usually performed by several annotators who provide a trace for a given dimension, i.e. a time-continuous series describing a dimension such as arousal or valence. However, annotations of the same expression are rarely consistent between annotators, either in time or in value, which adds bias and delay in the trace that is used to learn predictive models of emotion. We therefore propose a method that can dynamically compensate inconsistencies across annotations and synchronise the traces with the corresponding acoustic features using Recurrent Neural Networks. Experimental evaluations were carried on several emotion data sets that include Chinese, French, German, and Hungarian participants who interacted remotely in either noise-free conditions or in-the-wild. The results show that our method can significantly increase inter-annotator agreement, as well as correlation between traces and audio features, for both arousal and valence. In addition, improvements are obtained in the automatic prediction of these dimensions using simple light-weight models, especially for valence in noise-free conditions, and arousal for recordings captured in-the-wild.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we extend the Wiener-Ito chaos decomposition to the class of diffusion processes, whose drift and diffusion coefficient are of linear growth. By omitting the orthogonality in the chaos expansion, we are able to show that every $p$-integrable functional, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be represented as sum of iterated integrals of the underlying process. Using a truncated sum of this expansion and (possibly random) neural networks for the integrands, whose parameters are learned in a machine learning setting, we show that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily well in the $L^p$-sense. Moreover, the hedging strategy of the approximating financial derivative can be computed in closed form.

**Abstract:** Crop residue burning is a major source of air pollution in many parts of the world, notably South Asia. Policymakers, practitioners and researchers have invested in both measuring impacts and developing interventions to reduce burning. However, measuring the impacts of burning or the effectiveness of interventions to reduce burning requires data on where burning occurred. These data are challenging to collect in the field, both in terms of cost and feasibility. We take advantage of data from ground-based monitoring of crop residue burning in Punjab, India to explore whether burning can be detected more effectively using accessible satellite imagery. Specifically, we used 3m PlanetScope data with high temporal resolution (up to daily) as well as publicly-available Sentinel-2 data with weekly temporal resolution but greater depth of spectral information. Following an analysis of the ability of different spectral bands and burn indices to separate burned and unburned plots individually, we built a Random Forest model with those determined to provide the greatest separability and evaluated model performance with ground-verified data. Our overall model accuracy of 82-percent is favorable given the challenges presented by the measurement. Based on insights from this process, we discuss technical challenges of detecting crop residue burning from satellite imagery as well as challenges to measuring impacts, both of burning and of policy interventions.

**Abstract:** The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This research presents a novel self-supervised method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing Deep Learning and a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, without requiring human declarative knowledge. This method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data to fit the brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error average of 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. Findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable, does not rely on ad-hoc human-crafted models supporting replicability and falsifiability.

**Abstract:** Multi-agent exploration of a bounded 3D environment with unknown initial positions of agents is a challenging problem. It requires quickly exploring the environments as well as robustly merging the sub-maps built by the agents. We take the view that the existing approaches are either aggressive or conservative: Aggressive strategies merge two sub-maps built by different agents together when overlap is detected, which can lead to incorrect merging due to the false-positive detection of the overlap and is thus not robust. Conservative strategies direct one agent to revisit an excessive amount of the historical trajectory of another agent for verification before merging, which can lower the exploration efficiency due to the repeated exploration of the same space. To intelligently balance the robustness of sub-map merging and exploration efficiency, we develop a new approach for lidar-based multi-agent exploration, which can direct one agent to repeat another agent's trajectory in an \emph{adaptive} manner based on the quality indicator of the sub-map merging process. Additionally, our approach extends the recent single-agent hierarchical exploration strategy to multiple agents in a \emph{cooperative} manner by planning for agents with merged sub-maps together to further improve exploration efficiency. Our experiments show that our approach is up to 50\% more efficient than the baselines on average while merging sub-maps robustly.

**Abstract:** Fair Active Learning (FAL) utilized active learning techniques to achieve high model performance with limited data and to reach fairness between sensitive groups (e.g., genders). However, the impact of the adversarial attack, which is vital for various safety-critical machine learning applications, is not yet addressed in FAL. Observing this, we introduce a novel task, Fair Robust Active Learning (FRAL), integrating conventional FAL and adversarial robustness. FRAL requires ML models to leverage active learning techniques to jointly achieve equalized performance on benign data and equalized robustness against adversarial attacks between groups. In this new task, previous FAL methods generally face the problem of unbearable computational burden and ineffectiveness. Therefore, we develop a simple yet effective FRAL strategy by Joint INconsistency (JIN). To efficiently find samples that can boost the performance and robustness of disadvantaged groups for labeling, our method exploits the prediction inconsistency between benign and adversarial samples as well as between standard and robust models. Extensive experiments under diverse datasets and sensitive groups demonstrate that our method not only achieves fairer performance on benign samples but also obtains fairer robustness under white-box PGD attacks compared with existing active learning and FAL baselines. We are optimistic that FRAL would pave a new path for developing safe and robust ML research and applications such as facial attribute recognition in biometrics systems.

**Abstract:** Uncertainty plays a key role in future prediction. The future is uncertain. That means there might be many possible futures. A future prediction method should cover the whole possibilities to be robust. In autonomous driving, covering multiple modes in the prediction part is crucially important to make safety-critical decisions. Although computer vision systems have advanced tremendously in recent years, future prediction remains difficult today. Several examples are uncertainty of the future, the requirement of full scene understanding, and the noisy outputs space. In this thesis, we propose solutions to these challenges by modeling the motion explicitly in a stochastic way and learning the temporal dynamics in a latent space.

**Abstract:** We present a self-supervised method to disentangle factors of variation in high-dimensional data that does not rely on prior knowledge of the underlying variation profile (e.g., no assumptions on the number or distribution of the individual latent variables to be extracted). In this method which we call NashAE, high-dimensional feature disentanglement is accomplished in the low-dimensional latent space of a standard autoencoder (AE) by promoting the discrepancy between each encoding element and information of the element recovered from all other encoding elements. Disentanglement is promoted efficiently by framing this as a minmax game between the AE and an ensemble of regression networks which each provide an estimate of an element conditioned on an observation of all other elements. We quantitatively compare our approach with leading disentanglement methods using existing disentanglement metrics. Furthermore, we show that NashAE has increased reliability and increased capacity to capture salient data characteristics in the learned latent representation.

**Abstract:** Most of the popular Big Data analytics tools evolved to adapt their working environment to extract valuable information from a vast amount of unstructured data. The ability of data mining techniques to filter this helpful information from Big Data led to the term Big Data Mining. Shifting the scope of data from small-size, structured, and stable data to huge volume, unstructured, and quickly changing data brings many data management challenges. Different tools cope with these challenges in their own way due to their architectural limitations. There are numerous parameters to take into consideration when choosing the right data management framework based on the task at hand. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark for two widely used Big Data analytics tools, namely Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce, on a common data mining task, i.e., classification. We employ several evaluation metrics to compare the performance of the benchmarked frameworks, such as execution time, accuracy, and scalability. These metrics are specialized to measure the performance for classification task. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study in the literature that employs all these metrics while taking into consideration task-specific concerns. We show that Spark is 5 times faster than MapReduce on training the model. Nevertheless, the performance of Spark degrades when the input workload gets larger. Scaling the environment by additional clusters significantly improves the performance of Spark. However, similar enhancement is not observed in Hadoop. Machine learning utility of MapReduce tend to have better accuracy scores than that of Spark, like around 3%, even in small size data sets.

**Abstract:** We apply the technique of implicit differentiation to boost performance, reduce numerical error, and remove required user-tuning in the Marginal Unbiased Score Expansion (MUSE) algorithm for hierarchical Bayesian inference. We demonstrate these improvements on three representative inference problems: 1) an extended Neal's funnel 2) Bayesian neural networks, and 3) probabilistic principal component analysis. On our particular test cases, MUSE with implicit differentiation is faster than Hamiltonian Monte Carlo by factors of 155, 397, and 5, respectively, or factors of 65, 278, and 1 without implicit differentiation, and yields good approximate marginal posteriors. The Julia and Python MUSE packages have been updated to use implicit differentiation, and can solve problems defined by hand or with any of a number of popular probabilistic programming languages and automatic differentiation backends.

**Abstract:** Sequence models in reinforcement learning require task knowledge to estimate the task policy. This paper presents a hierarchical algorithm for learning a sequence model from demonstrations. The high-level mechanism guides the low-level controller through the task by selecting sub-goals for the latter to reach. This sequence replaces the returns-to-go of previous methods, improving its performance overall, especially in tasks with longer episodes and scarcer rewards. We validate our method in multiple tasks of OpenAIGym, D4RL and RoboMimic benchmarks. Our method outperforms the baselines in eight out of ten tasks of varied horizons and reward frequencies without prior task knowledge, showing the advantages of the hierarchical model approach for learning from demonstrations using a sequence model.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art object detectors have been shown effective in many applications. Usually, their performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics such as mean Average Precision. In this paper, we consider a safety property of 3D object detectors in the context of Autonomous Driving (AD). In particular, we propose an essential safety requirement for object detectors in AD and formulate it into a specification. During the formulation, we find that abstracting 3D objects with projected 2D bounding boxes on the image and bird's-eye-view planes allows for a necessary and sufficient condition to the proposed safety requirement. We then leverage the analysis and derive qualitative and quantitative safety metrics based on the Intersection-over-Ground-Truth measure and a distance ratio between predictions and ground truths. Finally, for continual improvement, we formulate safety losses that can be used to optimize object detectors towards higher safety scores. Our experiments with public models on the MMDetection3D library and the nuScenes datasets demonstrate the validity of our consideration and proposals.

**Abstract:** LCRL is a software tool that implements model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms over unknown Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), synthesising policies that satisfy a given linear temporal specification with maximal probability. LCRL leverages partially deterministic finite-state machines known as Limit Deterministic Buchi Automata (LDBA) to express a given linear temporal specification. A reward function for the RL algorithm is shaped on-the-fly, based on the structure of the LDBA. Theoretical guarantees under proper assumptions ensure the convergence of the RL algorithm to an optimal policy that maximises the satisfaction probability. We present case studies to demonstrate the applicability, ease of use, scalability, and performance of LCRL. Owing to the LDBA-guided exploration and LCRL model-free architecture, we observe robust performance, which also scales well when compared to standard RL approaches (whenever applicable to LTL specifications). Full instructions on how to execute all the case studies in this paper are provided on a GitHub page that accompanies the LCRL distribution www.github.com/grockious/lcrl.

**Abstract:** Music contains hierarchical structures beyond beats and measures. While hierarchical structure annotations are helpful for music information retrieval and computer musicology, such annotations are scarce in current digital music databases. In this paper, we explore a data-driven approach to automatically extract hierarchical metrical structures from scores. We propose a new model with a Temporal Convolutional Network-Conditional Random Field (TCN-CRF) architecture. Given a symbolic music score, our model takes in an arbitrary number of voices in a beat-quantized form, and predicts a 4-level hierarchical metrical structure from downbeat-level to section-level. We also annotate a dataset using RWC-POP MIDI files to facilitate training and evaluation. We show by experiments that the proposed method performs better than the rule-based approach under different orchestration settings. We also perform some simple musicological analysis on the model predictions. All demos, datasets and pre-trained models are publicly available on Github.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present an acoustic side channel attack which makes use of smartphone microphones recording a robot in operation to exploit acoustic properties of the sound to fingerprint a robot's movements. In this work we consider the possibility of an insider adversary who is within physical proximity of a robotic system (such as a technician or robot operator), equipped with only their smartphone microphone. Through the acoustic side-channel, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to fingerprint not only individual robot movements within 3D space, but also patterns of movements which could lead to inferring the purpose of the movements (i.e. surgical procedures which a surgical robot is undertaking) and hence, resulting in potential privacy violations. Upon evaluation, we find that individual robot movements can be fingerprinted with around 75% accuracy, decreasing slightly with more fine-grained movement meta-data such as distance and speed. Furthermore, workflows could be reconstructed with around 62% accuracy as a whole, with more complex movements such as pick-and-place or packing reconstructed with near perfect accuracy. As well as this, in some environments such as surgical settings, audio may be recorded and transmitted over VoIP, such as for education/teaching purposes or in remote telemedicine. The question here is, can the same attack be successful even when VoIP communication is employed, and how does packet loss impact the captured audio and the success of the attack? Using the same characteristics of acoustic sound for plain audio captured by the smartphone, the attack was 90% accurate in fingerprinting VoIP samples on average, 15% higher than the baseline without the VoIP codec employed. This opens up new research questions regarding anonymous communications to protect robotic systems from acoustic side channel attacks via VoIP communication networks.

**Abstract:** Connected teleoperated robotic systems play a key role in ensuring operational workflows are carried out with high levels of accuracy and low margins of error. In recent years, a variety of attacks have been proposed that actively target the robot itself from the cyber domain. However, little attention has been paid to the capabilities of a passive attacker. In this work, we investigate whether an insider adversary can accurately fingerprint robot movements and operational warehousing workflows via the radio frequency side channel in a stealthy manner. Using an SVM for classification, we found that an adversary can fingerprint individual robot movements with at least 96% accuracy, increasing to near perfect accuracy when reconstructing entire warehousing workflows.

**Abstract:** Knowing the 3D motions in a dynamic scene is essential to many vision applications. Recent progress is mainly focused on estimating the activity of some specific elements like humans. In this paper, we leverage a neural motion field for estimating the motion of all points in a multiview setting. Modeling the motion from a dynamic scene with multiview data is challenging due to the ambiguities in points of similar color and points with time-varying color. We propose to regularize the estimated motion to be predictable. If the motion from previous frames is known, then the motion in the near future should be predictable. Therefore, we introduce a predictability regularization by first conditioning the estimated motion on latent embeddings, then by adopting a predictor network to enforce predictability on the embeddings. The proposed framework PREF (Predictability REgularized Fields) achieves on par or better results than state-of-the-art neural motion field-based dynamic scene representation methods, while requiring no prior knowledge of the scene.

**Abstract:** The relationship between perceptual loudness and physical attributes of sound is an important subject in both computer music and psychoacoustics. Early studies of "equal-loudness contour" can trace back to the 1920s and the measured loudness with respect to intensity and frequency has been revised many times since then. However, most studies merely focus on synthesized sound, and the induced theories on natural tones with complex timbre have rarely been justified. To this end, we investigate both theory and applications of natural-tone loudness perception in this paper via modeling piano tone. The theory part contains: 1) an accurate measurement of piano-tone equal-loudness contour of pitches, and 2) a machine-learning model capable of inferring loudness purely based on spectral features trained on human subject measurements. As for the application, we apply our theory to piano control transfer, in which we adjust the MIDI velocities on two different player pianos (in different acoustic environments) to achieve the same perceptual effect. Experiments show that both our theoretical loudness modeling and the corresponding performance control transfer algorithm significantly outperform their baselines.

**Abstract:** Subseasonal forecasting $\unicode{x2013}$ predicting temperature and precipitation 2 to 6 weeks $\unicode{x2013}$ ahead is critical for effective water allocation, wildfire management, and drought and flood mitigation. Recent international research efforts have advanced the subseasonal capabilities of operational dynamical models, yet temperature and precipitation prediction skills remains poor, partly due to stubborn errors in representing atmospheric dynamics and physics inside dynamical models. To counter these errors, we introduce an adaptive bias correction (ABC) method that combines state-of-the-art dynamical forecasts with observations using machine learning. When applied to the leading subseasonal model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ABC improves temperature forecasting skill by 60-90% and precipitation forecasting skill by 40-69% in the contiguous U.S. We couple these performance improvements with a practical workflow, based on Cohort Shapley, for explaining ABC skill gains and identifying higher-skill windows of opportunity based on specific climate conditions.

**Abstract:** The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically catalyzed the proliferation of e-shopping. The dramatic growth of e-shopping will undoubtedly cause significant impacts on travel demand. As a result, transportation modeller's ability to model e-shopping demand is becoming increasingly important. This study developed models to predict household' weekly home delivery frequencies. We used both classical econometric and machine learning techniques to obtain the best model. It is found that socioeconomic factors such as having an online grocery membership, household members' average age, the percentage of male household members, the number of workers in the household and various land use factors influence home delivery demand. This study also compared the interpretations and performances of the machine learning models and the classical econometric model. Agreement is found in the variable's effects identified through the machine learning and econometric models. However, with similar recall accuracy, the ordered probit model, a classical econometric model, can accurately predict the aggregate distribution of household delivery demand. In contrast, both machine learning models failed to match the observed distribution.

**Abstract:** A widely used approach for extracting information from gene expression data employ the construction of a gene co-expression network and the subsequent application of algorithms that discover network structure. In particular, a common goal is the computational discovery of gene clusters, commonly called modules. When applied on a novel gene expression dataset, the quality of the computed modules can be evaluated automatically, using Gene Ontology enrichment, a method that measures the frequencies of Gene Ontology terms in the computed modules and evaluates their statistical likelihood. In this work we propose SGC a novel pipeline for gene clustering based on relatively recent seminal work in the mathematics of spectral network theory. SGC consists of multiple novel steps that enable the computation of highly enriched modules in an unsupervised manner. But unlike all existing frameworks, it further incorporates a novel step that leverages Gene Ontology information in a semi-supervised clustering method that further improves the quality of the computed modules. Comparing with already well-known existing frameworks, we show that SGC results in higher enrichment in real data. In particular, in 12 real gene expression datasets, SGC outperforms in all except one.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) seeks to distribute model training across local clients without collecting data in a centralized data-center, hence removing data-privacy concerns. A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where each client's data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence among local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods designed for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the impact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local statistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a special case of FL involving only a small number of reliable clients. For the more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g., edge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied, motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be used for any number of clients. We derive a first-order gradient regularization to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity. Specifically, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a first-order approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global update. The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) significantly faster convergence (i.e., fewer communication rounds) and 2) higher overall converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution. Importantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL applications.

**Abstract:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a useful approach to solving decentralised decision-making problems at scale. Research in the field has been growing steadily with many breakthrough algorithms proposed in recent years. In this work, we take a closer look at this rapid development with a focus on evaluation methodologies employed across a large body of research in cooperative MARL. By conducting a detailed meta-analysis of prior work, spanning 75 papers accepted for publication from 2016 to 2022, we bring to light worrying trends that put into question the true rate of progress. We further consider these trends in a wider context and take inspiration from single-agent RL literature on similar issues with recommendations that remain applicable to MARL. Combining these recommendations, with novel insights from our analysis, we propose a standardised performance evaluation protocol for cooperative MARL. We argue that such a standard protocol, if widely adopted, would greatly improve the validity and credibility of future research, make replication and reproducibility easier, as well as improve the ability of the field to accurately gauge the rate of progress over time by being able to make sound comparisons across different works. Finally, we release our meta-analysis data publicly on our project website for future research on evaluation: https://sites.google.com/view/marl-standard-protocol

**Abstract:** Transition to Adulthood is an essential life stage for many families. The prior research has shown that young people with intellectual or development disabil-ities (IDD) have more challenges than their peers. This study is to explore how to use natural language processing (NLP) methods, especially unsupervised machine learning, to assist psychologists to analyze emotions and sentiments and to use topic modeling to identify common issues and challenges that young people with IDD and their families have. Additionally, the results were compared to those obtained from young people without IDD who were in tran-sition to adulthood. The findings showed that NLP methods can be very useful for psychologists to analyze emotions, conduct cross-case analysis, and sum-marize key topics from conversational data.

**Abstract:** Sequential Recommendation (SR) characterizes evolving patterns of user behaviors by modeling how users transit among items. However, the short interaction sequences limit the performance of existing SR. To solve this problem, we focus on Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) in this paper, which aims to leverage information from other domains to improve the sequential recommendation performance of a single domain. Solving CDSR is challenging. On the one hand, how to retain single domain preferences as well as integrate cross-domain influence remains an essential problem. On the other hand, the data sparsity problem cannot be totally solved by simply utilizing knowledge from other domains, due to the limited length of the merged sequences. To address the challenges, we propose DDGHM, a novel framework for the CDSR problem, which includes two main modules, i.e., dual dynamic graph modeling and hybrid metric training. The former captures intra-domain and inter-domain sequential transitions through dynamically constructing two-level graphs, i.e., the local graphs and the global graph, and incorporating them with a fuse attentive gating mechanism. The latter enhances user and item representations by employing hybrid metric learning, including collaborative metric for achieving alignment and contrastive metric for preserving uniformity, to further alleviate data sparsity issue and improve prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of DDHMG.

**Abstract:** The forecasting of the credit default risk has been an important research field for several decades. Traditionally, logistic regression has been widely recognized as a solution due to its accuracy and interpretability. As a recent trend, researchers tend to use more complex and advanced machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of the prediction. Although certain non-linear machine learning methods have better predictive power, they are often considered to lack interpretability by financial regulators. Thus, they have not been widely applied in credit risk assessment. We introduce a neural network with the selective option to increase interpretability by distinguishing whether the datasets can be explained by the linear models or not. We find that, for most of the datasets, logistic regression will be sufficient, with reasonable accuracy; meanwhile, for some specific data portions, a shallow neural network model leads to much better accuracy without significantly sacrificing the interpretability.

**Abstract:** During recent years transformers architectures have been growing in popularity. Modulated Detection Transformer (MDETR) is an end-to-end multi-modal understanding model that performs tasks such as phase grounding, referring expression comprehension, referring expression segmentation, and visual question answering. One remarkable aspect of the model is the capacity to infer over classes that it was not previously trained for. In this work we explore the use of MDETR in a new task, action detection, without any previous training. We obtain quantitative results using the Atomic Visual Actions dataset. Although the model does not report the best performance in the task, we believe that it is an interesting finding. We show that it is possible to use a multi-modal model to tackle a task that it was not designed for. Finally, we believe that this line of research may lead into the generalization of MDETR in additional downstream tasks.

**Abstract:** How to design protein sequences folding into the desired structures effectively and efficiently? Structure-based protein design has attracted increasing attention in recent years; however, few methods can simultaneously improve the accuracy and efficiency due to the lack of expressive features and autoregressive sequence decoder. To address these issues, we propose ProDesign, which contains a novel residue featurizer and ProGNN layers to generate protein sequences in a one-shot way with improved recovery. Experiments show that ProDesign could achieve 51.66\% recovery on CATH 4.2, while the inference speed is 70 times faster than the autoregressive competitors. In addition, ProDesign achieves 58.72\% and 60.42\% recovery scores on TS50 and TS500, respectively. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to reveal the role of different types of protein features and model designs, inspiring further simplification and improvement.

**Abstract:** Implicit neural representation, which expresses an image as a continuous function rather than a discrete grid form, is widely used for image processing. Despite its outperforming results, there are still remaining limitations on restoring clear shapes of a given signal such as the edges of an image. In this paper, we propose Gradient Magnitude Adjustment algorithm which calculates the gradient of an image for training the implicit representation. In addition, we propose Edge-oriented Representation Network (EoREN) that can reconstruct the image with clear edges by fitting gradient information (Edge-oriented module). Furthermore, we add Channel-tuning module to adjust the distribution of given signals so that it solves a chronic problem of fitting gradients. By separating backpropagation paths of the two modules, EoREN can learn true color of the image without hindering the role for gradients. We qualitatively show that our model can reconstruct complex signals and demonstrate general reconstruction ability of our model with quantitative results.

**Abstract:** The Big Video Data generated in today's smart cities has raised concerns from its purposeful usage perspective, where surveillance cameras, among many others are the most prominent resources to contribute to the huge volumes of data, making its automated analysis a difficult task in terms of computation and preciseness. Violence Detection (VD), broadly plunging under Action and Activity recognition domain, is used to analyze Big Video data for anomalous actions incurred due to humans. The VD literature is traditionally based on manually engineered features, though advancements to deep learning based standalone models are developed for real-time VD analysis. This paper focuses on overview of deep sequence learning approaches along with localization strategies of the detected violence. This overview also dives into the initial image processing and machine learning-based VD literature and their possible advantages such as efficiency against the current complex models. Furthermore,the datasets are discussed, to provide an analysis of the current models, explaining their pros and cons with future directions in VD domain derived from an in-depth analysis of the previous methods.

**Abstract:** Functional connectivity network (FCN) data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is increasingly used for the diagnoses of brain disorders. However, state-of-the-art studies used to build the FCN using a single brain parcellation atlas at a certain spatial scale, which largely neglected functional interactions across different spatial scales in hierarchical manners. In this study, we propose a novel framework to perform multiscale FCN analysis for brain disorder diagnosis. We first use a set of well-defined multiscale atlases to compute multiscale FCNs. Then, we utilize biologically meaningful brain hierarchical relationships among the regions in multiscale atlases to perform nodal pooling across multiple spatial scales, namely "Atlas-guided Pooling". Accordingly, we propose a Multiscale-Atlases-based Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (MAHGCN), built on the stacked layers of graph convolution and the atlas-guided pooling, for a comprehensive extraction of diagnostic information from multiscale FCNs. Experiments on neuroimaging data from 1792 subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in the diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prodromal stage of AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), as well as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with accuracy of 88.9%, 78.6%, and 72.7% respectively. All results show significant advantages of our proposed method over other competing methods. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of brain disorder diagnosis using resting-state fMRI empowered by deep learning, but also highlights that the functional interactions in the multiscale brain hierarchy are worth being explored and integrated into deep learning network architectures for better understanding the neuropathology of brain disorders.

**Abstract:** As computing power is becoming the core productivity of the digital economy era, the concept of Computing and Network Convergence (CNC), under which network and computing resources can be dynamically scheduled and allocated according to users' needs, has been proposed and attracted wide attention. Based on the tasks' properties, the network orchestration plane needs to flexibly deploy tasks to appropriate computing nodes and arrange paths to the computing nodes. This is a orchestration problem that involves resource scheduling and path arrangement. Since CNC is relatively new, in this paper, we review some researches and applications on CNC. Then, we design a CNC orchestration method using reinforcement learning (RL), which is the first attempt, that can flexibly allocate and schedule computing resources and network resources. Which aims at high profit and low latency. Meanwhile, we use multi-factors to determine the optimization objective so that the orchestration strategy is optimized in terms of total performance from different aspects, such as cost, profit, latency and system overload in our experiment. The experiments shows that the proposed RL-based method can achieve higher profit and lower latency than the greedy method, random selection and balanced-resource method. We demonstrate RL is suitable for CNC orchestration. This paper enlightens the RL application on CNC orchestration.

**Abstract:** Advanced researches on connected vehicles have recently targeted to the integration of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with Machine Learning (ML) tools and distributed decision making. Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a new paradigm to train machine learning (ML) models in distributed systems, including vehicles in V2X networks. Rather than sharing and uploading the training data to the server, the updating of model parameters (e.g., neural networks' weights and biases) is applied by large populations of interconnected vehicles, acting as local learners. Despite these benefits, the limitation of existing approaches is the centralized optimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local parameters, leading to the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling issues for increasing V2X network size. Meanwhile, in intelligent transport scenarios, data collected from onboard sensors are redundant, which degrades the performance of aggregation. To tackle these problems, we explore a novel idea of decentralized data processing and introduce a federated learning framework for in-network vehicles, C-DFL(Consensus based Decentralized Federated Learning), to tackle federated learning on connected vehicles and improve learning quality. Extensive simulations have been implemented to evaluate the performance of C-DFL, that demonstrates C-DFL outperforms the performance of conventional methods in all cases.

**Abstract:** Particle accelerators are complex facilities that produce large amounts of structured data and have clear optimization goals as well as precisely defined control requirements. As such they are naturally amenable to data-driven research methodologies. The data from sensors and monitors inside the accelerator form multivariate time series. With fast pre-emptive approaches being highly preferred in accelerator control and diagnostics, the application of data-driven time series forecasting methods is particularly promising.
  This review formulates the time series forecasting problem and summarizes existing models with applications in various scientific areas. Several current and future attempts in the field of particle accelerators are introduced. The application of time series forecasting to particle accelerators has shown encouraging results and the promise for broader use, and existing problems such as data consistency and compatibility have started to be addressed.

**Abstract:** Robotic perception is currently at a cross-roads between modern methods which operate in an efficient latent space, and classical methods which are mathematically founded and provide interpretable, trustworthy results. In this paper, we introduce a Convolutional Bayesian Kernel Inference (ConvBKI) layer which explicitly performs Bayesian inference within a depthwise separable convolution layer to simultaneously maximize efficiency while maintaining reliability. We apply our layer to the task of 3D semantic mapping, where we learn semantic-geometric probability distributions for LiDAR sensor information in real time. We evaluate our network against state-of-the-art semantic mapping algorithms on the KITTI data set, and demonstrate improved latency with comparable semantic results.

**Abstract:** Early sensory systems in the brain rapidly adapt to fluctuating input statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons. Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable recurrent neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections) scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can be viewed as a recurrent neural network analogue of the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear networks.

**Abstract:** Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a unifying framework that generalizes both linear programming and quadratically-constrained quadratic programming, while also yielding efficient solvers, both in theory and in practice. However, there exist known impossibility results for approximating the optimal solution when constraints for covering SDPs arrive in an online fashion. In this paper, we study online covering linear and semidefinite programs in which the algorithm is augmented with advice from a possibly erroneous predictor. We show that if the predictor is accurate, we can efficiently bypass these impossibility results and achieve a constant-factor approximation to the optimal solution, i.e., consistency. On the other hand, if the predictor is inaccurate, under some technical conditions, we achieve results that match both the classical optimal upper bounds and the tight lower bounds up to constant factors, i.e., robustness.
  More broadly, we introduce a framework that extends both (1) the online set cover problem augmented with machine-learning predictors, studied by Bamas, Maggiori, and Svensson (NeurIPS 2020), and (2) the online covering SDP problem, initiated by Elad, Kale, and Naor (ICALP 2016). Specifically, we obtain general online learning-augmented algorithms for covering linear programs with fractional advice and constraints, and initiate the study of learning-augmented algorithms for covering SDP problems.
  Our techniques are based on the primal-dual framework of Buchbinder and Naor (Mathematics of Operations Research, 34, 2009) and can be further adjusted to handle constraints where the variables lie in a bounded region, i.e., box constraints.

**Abstract:** A clustering outcome for high-dimensional data is typically interpreted via post-processing, involving dimension reduction and subsequent visualization. This destroys the meaning of the data and obfuscates interpretations. We propose algorithm-agnostic interpretation methods to explain clustering outcomes in reduced dimensions while preserving the integrity of the data. The permutation feature importance for clustering represents a general framework based on shuffling feature values and measuring changes in cluster assignments through custom score functions. The individual conditional expectation for clustering indicates observation-wise changes in the cluster assignment due to changes in the data. The partial dependence for clustering evaluates average changes in cluster assignments for the entire feature space. All methods can be used with any clustering algorithm able to reassign instances through soft or hard labels. In contrast to common post-processing methods such as principal component analysis, the introduced methods maintain the original structure of the features.

**Abstract:** A key factor to optimal acceptance and comfort of automated vehicle features is the driving style. Mismatches between the automated and the driver preferred driving styles can make users take over more frequently or even disable the automation features. This work proposes identification of user driving style preference with multimodal signals, so the vehicle could match user preference in a continuous and automatic way. We conducted a driving simulator study with 36 participants and collected extensive multimodal data including behavioral, physiological, and situational data. This includes eye gaze, steering grip force, driving maneuvers, brake and throttle pedal inputs as well as foot distance from pedals, pupil diameter, galvanic skin response, heart rate, and situational drive context. Then, we built machine learning models to identify preferred driving styles, and confirmed that all modalities are important for the identification of user preference. This work paves the road for implicit adaptive driving styles on automated vehicles.

**Abstract:** Since demand is influenced by a wide variety of causes, it is necessary to decompose the explana-tory variables into different levels, extract their relationships effectively, and reflect them in the forecast. In particular, this contextual information can be very useful in demand forecasting with large demand volatility or intermittent demand patterns. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many fields where important information in data is represented by images. CNNs are powerful because they accept samples as images and use adjacent voxel sets to integrate multi-dimensional important information and learn important features. On the other hand, although the demand-forecasting model has been improved, the input data is still limited in its tabular form and is not suitable for CNN modeling. In this study, we propose a Tab2vox neural architecture search (NAS) model as a method to convert a high-dimensional tabular sam-ple into a well-formed 3D voxel image and use it in a 3D CNN network. For each image repre-sentation, the 3D CNN forecasting model proposed from the Tab2vox framework showed supe-rior performance, compared to the existing time series and machine learning techniques using tabular data, and the latest image transformation studies.

<p>

**Abstract:** With the booming of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), CNNs such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50 widely serve as backbone in SAR ship detection. However, CNN based backbone is hard to model long-range dependencies, and causes the lack of enough high-quality semantic information in feature maps of shallow layers, which leads to poor detection performance in complicated background and small-sized ships cases. To address these problems, we propose a SAR ship detection method based on Swin Transformer and Feature Enhancement Feature Pyramid Network (FEFPN). Swin Transformer serves as backbone to model long-range dependencies and generates hierarchical features maps. FEFPN is proposed to further improve the quality of feature maps by gradually enhancing the semantic information of feature maps at all levels, especially feature maps in shallow layers. Experiments conducted on SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) reveal the advantage of our proposed methods.

**Abstract:** Network architecture search (NAS), in particular the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) method, has shown a great power to learn excellent model architectures on the specific dataset of interest. In contrast to using a fixed dataset, in this work, we focus on a different but important scenario for NAS: how to refine a deployed network's model architecture to enhance its robustness with the guidance of a few collected and misclassified examples that are degraded by some real-world unknown corruptions having a specific pattern (e.g., noise, blur, etc.). To this end, we first conduct an empirical study to validate that the model architectures can be definitely related to the corruption patterns. Surprisingly, by just adding a few corrupted and misclassified examples (e.g., $10^3$ examples) to the clean training dataset (e.g., $5.0 \times 10^4$ examples), we can refine the model architecture and enhance the robustness significantly. To make it more practical, the key problem, i.e., how to select the proper failure examples for the effective NAS guidance, should be carefully investigated. Then, we propose a novel core-failure-set guided DARTS that embeds a K-center-greedy algorithm for DARTS to select suitable corrupted failure examples to refine the model architecture. We use our method for DARTS-refined DNNs on the clean as well as 15 corruptions with the guidance of four specific real-world corruptions. Compared with the state-of-the-art NAS as well as data-augmentation-based enhancement methods, our final method can achieve higher accuracy on both corrupted datasets and the original clean dataset. On some of the corruption patterns, we can achieve as high as over 45% absolute accuracy improvements.

**Abstract:** Neural Networks as fast physics simulators have a large potential for many engineering design tasks. Prerequisites for a wide-spread application are an easy-to-use workflow for generating training datasets in a reasonable time, and the capability of the network to generalize to unseen systems. In contrast to most previous works where training systems are similar to the evaluation dataset, we propose to adapt the type of training system to the network architecture. Specifically, we apply a fully convolutional network and, thus, design 3D systems of randomly located voxels with randomly assigned physical properties. The idea is tested for the transient heat diffusion in electronic systems. Training only on random "Minecraft" systems, we obtain good generalization to electronic systems four times as large as the training systems (one-step prediction error of 0.07% vs 0.8%).

**Abstract:** In conventional multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems with frequency division duplexing (FDD), channel acquisition and precoder optimization processes have been designed separately although they are highly coupled. This paper studies an end-to-end design of downlink MU-MIMO systems which include pilot sequences, limited feedback, and precoding. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) framework which jointly optimizes the feedback information generation at users and the precoder design at a base station (BS). Each procedure in the MU-MIMO systems is replaced by intelligently designed multiple deep neural networks (DNN) units. At the BS, a neural network generates pilot sequences and helps the users obtain accurate channel state information. At each user, the channel feedback operation is carried out in a distributed manner by an individual user DNN. Then, another BS DNN collects feedback information from the users and determines the MIMO precoding matrices. A joint training algorithm is proposed to optimize all DNN units in an end-to-end manner. In addition, a training strategy which can avoid retraining for different network sizes for a scalable design is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DL framework compared to classical optimization techniques and other conventional DNN schemes.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have shown great potential in improving the medical imaging workflow, from image acquisition and reconstruction to disease diagnosis and treatment. Particularly, in recent years, there has been a significant growth in the use of AI and ML algorithms, especially Deep Learning (DL) based methods, for medical image reconstruction. DL techniques have shown to be competitive and often superior over conventional reconstruction methods in terms of both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The use of DL-based image reconstruction also provides promising opportunities to transform the way cardiac images are acquired and reconstructed. In this chapter, we will review recent advances in DL-based reconstruction techniques for cardiac imaging, with emphasis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image reconstruction. We mainly focus on supervised DL methods for the application, including image post-processing techniques, model-driven approaches and k-space based methods. Current limitations, challenges and future opportunities of DL for cardiac image reconstruction are also discussed.

**Abstract:** Generalized Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau Manifold (gCICY) is a new construction of Calabi-Yau manifolds established recently. However, the generation of new gCICYs using standard algebraic method is very laborious. Due to this complexity, the number of gCICYs and their classification still remain unknown. In this paper, we try to make some progress in this direction using neural network. The results showed that our trained models can have a high precision on the existing type $(1,1)$ and type $(2,1)$ gCICYs in the literature. Moreover, They can achieve a $97\%$ precision in predicting new gCICY which is generated differently from those used for training and testing. This shows that machine learning could be an effective method to classify and generate new gCICY.

**Abstract:** Incorporating personal preference is crucial in advanced machine translation tasks. Despite the recent advancement of machine translation, it remains a demanding task to properly reflect personal style. In this paper, we introduce a personalized automatic post-editing framework to address this challenge, which effectively generates sentences considering distinct personal behaviors. To build this framework, we first collect post-editing data that connotes the user preference from a live machine translation system. Specifically, real-world users enter source sentences for translation and edit the machine-translated outputs according to the user's preferred style. We then propose a model that combines a discriminator module and user-specific parameters on the APE framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline models on four different metrics (i.e., BLEU, TER, YiSi-1, and human evaluation).

**Abstract:** It is common for data structures such as images and shapes of 2D objects to be represented as points on a manifold. The utility of a mechanism to produce sanitized differentially private estimates from such data is intimately linked to how compatible it is with the underlying structure and geometry of the space. In particular, as recently shown, utility of the Laplace mechanism on a positively curved manifold, such as Kendall's 2D shape space, is significantly influences by the curvature. Focusing on the problem of sanitizing the FrÃ©chet mean of a sample of points on a manifold, we exploit the characterisation of the mean as the minimizer of an objective function comprised of the sum of squared distances and develop a K-norm gradient mechanism on Riemannian manifolds that favors values that produce gradients close to the the zero of the objective function. For the case of positively curved manifolds, we describe how using the gradient of the squared distance function offers better control over sensitivity than the Laplace mechanism, and demonstrate this numerically on a dataset of shapes of corpus callosa. Further illustrations of the mechanism's utility on a sphere and the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices are also presented.

**Abstract:** Over the last few decades, extensive use of information and communication technologies has been the main driver of the digitalization of power systems. Proper and secure monitoring of the critical grid infrastructure became an integral part of the modern power system. Using phasor measurement units (PMUs) to surveil the power system is one of the technologies that have a promising future. Increased frequency of measurements and smarter methods for data handling can improve the ability to reliably operate power grids. The increased cyber-physical interaction offers both benefits and drawbacks, where one of the drawbacks comes in the form of anomalies in the measurement data. The anomalies can be caused by both physical faults on the power grid, as well as disturbances, errors, and cyber attacks in the cyber layer. This paper aims to develop a hybrid AI-based model that is based on various methods such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and other relevant hybrid algorithms for anomaly detection in phasor measurement unit data. The dataset used within this research was acquired by the University of Texas, which consists of real data from grid measurements. In addition to the real data, false data that has been injected to produce anomalies has been analyzed. The impacts and mitigating methods to prevent such kind of anomalies are discussed.

**Abstract:** Event-based cameras have recently shown great potential for high-speed motion estimation owing to their ability to capture temporally rich information asynchronously. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their neuro-inspired event-driven processing can efficiently handle such asynchronous data, while neuron models such as the leaky-integrate and fire (LIF) can keep track of the quintessential timing information contained in the inputs. SNNs achieve this by maintaining a dynamic state in the neuron memory, retaining important information while forgetting redundant data over time. Thus, we posit that SNNs would allow for better performance on sequential regression tasks compared to similarly sized Analog Neural Networks (ANNs). However, deep SNNs are difficult to train due to vanishing spikes at later layers. To that effect, we propose an adaptive fully-spiking framework with learnable neuronal dynamics to alleviate the spike vanishing problem. We utilize surrogate gradient-based backpropagation through time (BPTT) to train our deep SNNs from scratch. We validate our approach for the task of optical flow estimation on the Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) dataset and the DSEC-Flow dataset. Our experiments on these datasets show an average reduction of 13% in average endpoint error (AEE) compared to state-of-the-art ANNs. We also explore several down-scaled models and observe that our SNN models consistently outperform similarly sized ANNs offering 10%-16% lower AEE. These results demonstrate the importance of SNNs for smaller models and their suitability at the edge. In terms of efficiency, our SNNs offer substantial savings in network parameters (48x) and computational energy (51x) while attaining ~10% lower EPE compared to the state-of-the-art ANN implementations.

**Abstract:** The accuracy of recent deep learning based clinical decision support systems is promising. However, lack of model interpretability remains an obstacle to widespread adoption of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Using sleep as a case study, we propose a generalizable method to combine clinical interpretability with high accuracy derived from black-box deep learning. Clinician-determined sleep stages from polysomnogram (PSG) remain the gold standard for evaluating sleep quality. However, PSG manual annotation by experts is expensive and time-prohibitive. We propose SERF, interpretable Sleep staging using Embeddings, Rules, and Features to read PSG. SERF provides interpretation of classified sleep stages through meaningful features derived from the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. In SERF, the embeddings obtained from a hybrid of convolutional and recurrent neural networks are transposed to the interpretable feature space. These representative interpretable features are used to train simple models like a shallow decision tree for classification. Model results are validated on two publicly available datasets. SERF surpasses the current state-of-the-art for interpretable sleep staging by 2%. Using Gradient Boosted Trees as the classifier, SERF obtains 0.766 $Îº$ and 0.870 AUC-ROC, within 2% of the current state-of-the-art black-box models.

**Abstract:** Solar Plages are bright chromospheric features observed in Ca II K photographic observations of the sun. These are regions of high magnetic field concentration thus tracer of magnetic activity of the Sun and are one of the most important features to study long-term variability of the Sun as Ca II K spectroheliograms are recorded for more than a century. . However, detection of the plages from century-long databases is a non-trivial task and need significant human resources for doing it manually. Hence, in this study, we propose an image processing algorithm that can identify solar plages from Ca II K photographic observations. The proposed study has been implemented on archival data from Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. To ensure that the algorithm works, irrespective of noise level, brightness, and other image properties, we randomly draw a sample of images from the data archive to test our algorithm.

**Abstract:** Representation disentanglement is an important goal of representation learning that benefits various downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, many unsupervised learning representation disentanglement approaches have been developed. However, the training process without utilizing any supervision signal have been proved to be inadequate for disentanglement representation learning. Therefore, we propose a novel weakly-supervised training approach, named as SW-VAE, which incorporates pairs of input observations as supervision signals by using the generative factors of datasets. Furthermore, we introduce strategies to gradually increase the learning difficulty during training to smooth the training process. As shown on several datasets, our model shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on representation disentanglement tasks.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of solving robust Markov decision process (MDP), which involves a set of discounted, finite state, finite action space MDPs with uncertain transition kernels. The goal of planning is to find a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case values against the transition uncertainties, and thus encompasses the standard MDP planning as a special case. For $(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{a})$-rectangular uncertainty sets, we develop a policy-based first-order method, namely the robust policy mirror descent (RPMD), and establish an $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/Îµ))$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/Îµ)$ iteration complexity for finding an $Îµ$-optimal policy, with two increasing-stepsize schemes. The prior convergence of RPMD is applicable to any Bregman divergence, provided the policy space has bounded radius measured by the divergence when centering at the initial policy. Moreover, when the Bregman divergence corresponds to the squared euclidean distance, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(\max \{1/Îµ, 1/(Î·Îµ^2)\})$ complexity of RPMD with any constant stepsize $Î·$. For a general class of Bregman divergences, a similar complexity is also established for RPMD with constant stepsizes, provided the uncertainty set satisfies the relative strong convexity. We further develop a stochastic variant, named SRPMD, when the first-order information is only available through online interactions with the nominal environment. For general Bregman divergences, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/Îµ^2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/Îµ^3)$ sample complexity with two increasing-stepsize schemes. For the euclidean Bregman divergence, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/Îµ^3)$ sample complexity with constant stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, all the aforementioned results appear to be new for policy-based first-order methods applied to the robust MDP problem.

<p>

**Abstract:** Clustered federated learning (FL) has been shown to produce promising results by grouping clients into clusters. This is especially effective in scenarios where separate groups of clients have significant differences in the distributions of their local data. Existing clustered FL algorithms are essentially trying to group together clients with similar distributions so that clients in the same cluster can leverage each other's data to better perform federated learning. However, prior clustered FL algorithms attempt to learn these distribution similarities indirectly during training, which can be quite time consuming as many rounds of federated learning may be required until the formation of clusters is stabilized. In this paper, we propose a new approach to federated learning that directly aims to efficiently identify distribution similarities among clients by analyzing the principal angles between the client data subspaces. Each client applies a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) step on its local data in a single-shot manner to derive a small set of principal vectors, which provides a signature that succinctly captures the main characteristics of the underlying distribution. This small set of principal vectors is provided to the server so that the server can directly identify distribution similarities among the clients to form clusters. This is achieved by comparing the similarities of the principal angles between the client data subspaces spanned by those principal vectors. The approach provides a simple, yet effective clustered FL framework that addresses a broad range of data heterogeneity issues beyond simpler forms of Non-IIDness like label skews. Our clustered FL approach also enables convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives. Our code is available at https://github.com/MMorafah/PACFL.

**Abstract:** We present the Grasp Proposal Network (GP-net), a Convolutional Neural Network model which can generate 6-DOF grasps for mobile manipulators. To train GP-net, we synthetically generate a dataset containing depth-images and ground-truth grasp information for more than 1400 objects. In real-world experiments we use the EGAD! grasping benchmark to evaluate GP-net against two commonly used algorithms, the Volumetric Grasping Network (VGN) and the Grasp Pose Detection package (GPD), on a PAL TIAGo mobile manipulator. GP-net achieves grasp success rates of 82.2% compared to 57.8% for VGN and 63.3% with GPD. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods in robotic grasping, GP-net can be used out-of-the-box for grasping objects with mobile manipulators without limiting the workspace, requiring table segmentation or needing a high-end GPU. To encourage the usage of GP-net, we provide a ROS package along with our code and pre-trained models at https://aucoroboticsmu.github.io/GP-net/.

**Abstract:** Online social networks are actively involved in the removal of malicious social bots due to their role in the spread of low quality information. However, most of the existing bot detectors are supervised classifiers incapable of capturing the evolving behavior of sophisticated bots. Here we propose MulBot, an unsupervised bot detector based on multivariate time series (MTS). For the first time, we exploit multidimensional temporal features extracted from user timelines. We manage the multidimensionality with an LSTM autoencoder, which projects the MTS in a suitable latent space. Then, we perform a clustering step on this encoded representation to identify dense groups of very similar users -- a known sign of automation. Finally, we perform a binary classification task achieving f1-score $= 0.99$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (f1-score $\le 0.97$). Not only does MulBot achieve excellent results in the binary classification task, but we also demonstrate its strengths in a novel and practically-relevant task: detecting and separating different botnets. In this multi-class classification task we achieve f1-score $= 0.96$. We conclude by estimating the importance of the different features used in our model and by evaluating MulBot's capability to generalize to new unseen bots, thus proposing a solution to the generalization deficiencies of supervised bot detectors.

**Abstract:** We study the oracle complexity of producing $(Î´,Îµ)$-stationary points of Lipschitz functions, in the sense proposed by Zhang et al. [2020]. While there exist dimension-free randomized algorithms for producing such points within $\widetilde{O}(1/Î´Îµ^3)$ first-order oracle calls, we show that no dimension-free rate can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm. On the other hand, we point out that this rate can be derandomized for smooth functions with merely a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness parameter. Moreover, we establish several lower bounds for this task which hold for any randomized algorithm, with or without convexity. Finally, we show how the convergence rate of finding $(Î´,Îµ)$-stationary points can be improved in case the function is convex, a setting which we motivate by proving that in general no finite time algorithm can produce points with small subgradients even for convex functions.

**Abstract:** Noisy sensing, imperfect control, and environment changes are defining characteristics of many real-world robot tasks. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled mathematical framework for modeling and solving robot decision and control tasks under uncertainty. Over the last decade, it has seen many successful applications, spanning localization and navigation, search and tracking, autonomous driving, multi-robot systems, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. This survey aims to bridge the gap between the development of POMDP models and algorithms at one end and application to diverse robot decision tasks at the other. It analyzes the characteristics of these tasks and connects them with the mathematical and algorithmic properties of the POMDP framework for effective modeling and solution. For practitioners, the survey provides some of the key task characteristics in deciding when and how to apply POMDPs to robot tasks successfully. For POMDP algorithm designers, the survey provides new insights into the unique challenges of applying POMDPs to robot systems and points to promising new directions for further research.

**Abstract:** We propose methods that enable efficient hierarchical classification in parallel. Our methods transform a batch of classification scores and labels, corresponding to given nodes in a semantic tree, to scores and labels corresponding to all nodes in the ancestral paths going down the tree to every given node, relying only on tensor operations that execute efficiently on hardware accelerators. We implement our methods and test them on current hardware accelerators with a tree incorporating all English-language synsets in WordNet 3.0, spanning 117,659 classes in 20 levels of depth. We transform batches of scores and labels to their respective ancestral paths, incurring negligible computation and consuming only a fixed 0.04GB of memory over the footprint of data.

**Abstract:** The learning of the simplest possible computational pattern -- periodicity -- is an open problem in the research of strong generalisation in neural networks. We formalise the problem of extrapolative generalisation for periodic signals and systematically investigate the generalisation abilities of classical, population-based, and recently proposed periodic architectures on a set of benchmarking tasks. We find that periodic and "snake" activation functions consistently fail at periodic extrapolation, regardless of the trainability of their periodicity parameters. Further, our results show that traditional sequential models still outperform the novel architectures designed specifically for extrapolation, and that these are in turn trumped by population-based training. We make our benchmarking and evaluation toolkit, PerKit, available and easily accessible to facilitate future work in the area.

**Abstract:** Despite a surge of recent advances in promoting machine Learning (ML) fairness, the existing mainstream approaches mostly require training or finetuning the entire weights of the neural network to meet the fairness criteria. However, this is often infeasible in practice for those large-scale trained models due to large computational and storage costs, low data efficiency, and model privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a new generic fairness learning paradigm, called FairReprogram, which incorporates the model reprogramming technique. Specifically, FairReprogram considers the neural model fixed, and instead appends to the input a set of perturbations, called the fairness trigger, which is tuned towards the fairness criteria under a min-max formulation. We further introduce an information-theoretic framework that explains why and under what conditions fairness goals can be achieved using the fairness trigger. We show both theoretically and empirically that the fairness trigger can effectively obscure demographic biases in the output prediction of fixed ML models by providing false demographic information that hinders the model from utilizing the correct demographic information to make the prediction. Extensive experiments on both NLP and CV datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve better fairness improvements than retraining-based methods with far less training cost and data dependency under two widely-used fairness criteria.

**Abstract:** Medical image classification has developed rapidly under the impetus of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Due to the fixed size of the receptive field of the convolution kernel, it is difficult to capture the global features of medical images. Although the self-attention-based Transformer can model long-range dependencies, it has high computational complexity and lacks local inductive bias. Much research has demonstrated that global and local features are crucial for image classification. However, medical images have a lot of noisy, scattered features, intra-class variation, and inter-class similarities. This paper proposes a three-branch hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion network structure termed as HiFuse for medical image classification as a new method. It can fuse the advantages of Transformer and CNN from multi-scale hierarchies without destroying the respective modeling so as to improve the classification accuracy of various medical images. A parallel hierarchy of local and global feature blocks is designed to efficiently extract local features and global representations at various semantic scales, with the flexibility to model at different scales and linear computational complexity relevant to image size. Moreover, an adaptive hierarchical feature fusion block (HFF block) is designed to utilize the features obtained at different hierarchical levels comprehensively. The HFF block contains spatial attention, channel attention, residual inverted MLP, and shortcut to adaptively fuse semantic information between various scale features of each branch. The accuracy of our proposed model on the ISIC2018 dataset is 7.6% higher than baseline, 21.5% on the Covid-19 dataset, and 10.4% on the Kvasir dataset. Compared with other advanced models, the HiFuse model performs the best. Our code is open-source and available from https://github.com/huoxiangzuo/HiFuse.

**Abstract:** We present a novel implicit representation -- neural halfspace representation (NH-Rep), to convert manifold B-Rep solids to implicit representations. NH-Rep is a Boolean tree built on a set of implicit functions represented by the neural network, and the composite Boolean function is capable of representing solid geometry while preserving sharp features. We propose an efficient algorithm to extract the Boolean tree from a manifold B-Rep solid and devise a neural network-based optimization approach to compute the implicit functions. We demonstrate the high quality offered by our conversion algorithm on ten thousand manifold B-Rep CAD models that contain various curved patches including NURBS, and the superiority of our learning approach over other representative implicit conversion algorithms in terms of surface reconstruction, sharp feature preservation, signed distance field approximation, and robustness to various surface geometry, as well as a set of applications supported by NH-Rep.

**Abstract:** Robust Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used for applications of dynamic optimization in uncertain environments and have been studied extensively. Many of the main properties and algorithms of MDPs, such as value iteration and policy iteration, extend directly to RMDPs. Surprisingly, there is no known analog of the MDP convex optimization formulation for solving RMDPs. This work describes the first convex optimization formulation of RMDPs under the classical sa-rectangularity and s-rectangularity assumptions. We derive a convex formulation with a linear number of variables and constraints but large coefficients in the constraints by using entropic regularization and exponential change of variables. Our formulation can be combined with efficient methods from convex optimization to obtain new algorithms for solving RMDPs with uncertain probabilities. We further simplify the formulation for RMDPs with polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our work opens a new research direction for RMDPs and can serve as a first step toward obtaining a tractable convex formulation of RMDPs.

**Abstract:** We introduce the first learning-based reconstructability predictor to improve view and path planning for large-scale 3D urban scene acquisition using unmanned drones. In contrast to previous heuristic approaches, our method learns a model that explicitly predicts how well a 3D urban scene will be reconstructed from a set of viewpoints. To make such a model trainable and simultaneously applicable to drone path planning, we simulate the proxy-based 3D scene reconstruction during training to set up the prediction. Specifically, the neural network we design is trained to predict the scene reconstructability as a function of the proxy geometry, a set of viewpoints, and optionally a series of scene images acquired in flight. To reconstruct a new urban scene, we first build the 3D scene proxy, then rely on the predicted reconstruction quality and uncertainty measures by our network, based off of the proxy geometry, to guide the drone path planning. We demonstrate that our data-driven reconstructability predictions are more closely correlated to the true reconstruction quality than prior heuristic measures. Further, our learned predictor can be easily integrated into existing path planners to yield improvements. Finally, we devise a new iterative view planning framework, based on the learned reconstructability, and show superior performance of the new planner when reconstructing both synthetic and real scenes.

**Abstract:** Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a vital task since even a few anomalies can pose huge threats to benign users. Recent semi-supervised GAD methods, which can effectively leverage the available labels as prior knowledge, have achieved superior performances than unsupervised methods. In practice, people usually need to identify anomalies on new (sub)graphs to secure their business, but they may lack labels to train an effective detection model. One natural idea is to directly adopt a trained GAD model to the new (sub)graph for testing. However, we find that existing semi-supervised GAD methods suffer from poor generalization issue, i.e., well-trained models could not perform well on an unseen area (i.e., not accessible in training) of the same graph. It may cause great troubles. In this paper, we base on the phenomenon and propose a general and novel research problem of generalized graph anomaly detection that aims to effectively identify anomalies on both the training-domain graph and unseen testing graph to eliminate potential dangers. Nevertheless, it is a challenging task since only limited labels are available, and the normal background may differ between training and testing data. Accordingly, we propose a data augmentation method named \textit{AugAN} (\uline{Aug}mentation for \uline{A}nomaly and \uline{N}ormal distributions) to enrich training data and boost the generalizability of GAD models. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our method in improving model generalizability.

**Abstract:** Historical interactions are the default choice for recommender model training, which typically exhibit high sparsity, i.e., most user-item pairs are unobserved missing data. A standard choice is treating the missing data as negative training samples and estimating interaction likelihood between user-item pairs along with the observed interactions. In this way, some potential interactions are inevitably mislabeled during training, which will hurt the model fidelity, hindering the model to recall the mislabeled items, especially the long-tail ones. In this work, we investigate the mislabeling issue from a new perspective of aleatoric uncertainty, which describes the inherent randomness of missing data. The randomness pushes us to go beyond merely the interaction likelihood and embrace aleatoric uncertainty modeling. Towards this end, we propose a new Aleatoric Uncertainty-aware Recommendation (AUR) framework that consists of a new uncertainty estimator along with a normal recommender model. According to the theory of aleatoric uncertainty, we derive a new recommendation objective to learn the estimator. As the chance of mislabeling reflects the potential of a pair, AUR makes recommendations according to the uncertainty, which is demonstrated to improve the recommendation performance of less popular items without sacrificing the overall performance. We instantiate AUR on three representative recommender models: Matrix Factorization (MF), LightGCN, and VAE from mainstream model architectures. Extensive results on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of AUR w.r.t. better recommendation results, especially on long-tail items.

**Abstract:** The massive use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), increasingly popular in many areas of scientific computing, rapidly increases the energy consumption of modern high-performance computing systems. An appealing and possibly more sustainable alternative is provided by novel neuromorphic paradigms, which directly implement ANNs in hardware. However, little is known about the actual benefits of running ANNs on neuromorphic hardware for use cases in scientific computing. Here we present a methodology for measuring the energy cost and compute time for inference tasks with ANNs on conventional hardware. In addition, we have designed an architecture for these tasks and estimate the same metrics based on a state-of-the-art analog in-memory computing (AIMC) platform, one of the key paradigms in neuromorphic computing. Both methodologies are compared for a use case in quantum many-body physics in two dimensional condensed matter systems and for anomaly detection at 40 MHz rates at the Large Hadron Collider in particle physics. We find that AIMC can achieve up to one order of magnitude shorter computation times than conventional hardware, at an energy cost that is up to three orders of magnitude smaller. This suggests great potential for faster and more sustainable scientific computing with neuromorphic hardware.

**Abstract:** Data-driven approaches and paradigms have become promising solutions to efficient network performances through optimization. These approaches focus on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that can address the needs of 5G networks and the networks of tomorrow, such as proactive load balancing. In contrast to model-based approaches, data-driven approaches do not need accurate models to tackle the target problem, and their associated architectures provide a flexibility of available system parameters that improve the feasibility of learning-based algorithms in mobile wireless networks. The work presented in this paper focuses on demonstrating a working system prototype of the 5G Core (5GC) network and the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) used to bring the benefits of data-driven techniques to fruition. Analyses of the network-generated data explore core intra-network interactions through unsupervised learning, clustering, and evaluate these results as insights for future opportunities and works.

**Abstract:** Task-oriented communications, mostly using learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC), aim to design a communication-efficient edge inference system by transmitting task-relevant information to the receiver. However, only transmitting task-relevant information without introducing any redundancy may cause robustness issues in learning due to the channel variations, and the JSCC which directly maps the source data into continuous channel input symbols poses compatibility issues on existing digital communication systems. In this paper, we address these two issues by first investigating the inherent tradeoff between the informativeness of the encoded representations and the robustness to information distortion in the received representations, and then propose a task-oriented communication scheme with digital modulation, named discrete task-oriented JSCC (DT-JSCC), where the transmitter encodes the features into a discrete representation and transmits it to the receiver with the digital modulation scheme. In the DT-JSCC scheme, we develop a robust encoding framework, named robust information bottleneck (RIB), to improve the communication robustness to the channel variations, and derive a tractable variational upper bound of the RIB objective function using the variational approximation to overcome the computational intractability of mutual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DT-JSCC achieves better inference performance than the baseline methods with low communication latency, and exhibits robustness to channel variations due to the applied RIB framework.

**Abstract:** Angluin's L* algorithm learns the minimal (complete) deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of a regular language using membership and equivalence queries. Its probabilistic approximatively correct (PAC) version substitutes an equivalence query by a large enough set of random membership queries to get a high level confidence to the answer. Thus it can be applied to any kind of (also non-regular) device and may be viewed as an algorithm for synthesizing an automaton abstracting the behavior of the device based on observations.  Here we are interested on how Angluin's PAC learning algorithm behaves for devices which are obtained from a DFA by introducing some noise. More precisely we study whether Angluin's algorithm reduces the noise and produces a DFA closer to the original one than the noisy device.  We propose several ways to introduce the noise: (1) the noisy device inverts the classification of words w.r.t. the DFA with a small probability, (2) the noisy device modifies with a small probability the letters of the word before asking its classification w.r.t. the DFA, and (3) the noisy device combines the classification of a word w.r.t. the DFA and its classification w.r.t. a counter automaton.  Our experiments were performed on several hundred DFAs.
  Our main contributions, bluntly stated, consist in showing that: (1) Angluin's algorithm behaves well whenever the noisy device is produced by a random process, (2) but poorly with a structured noise, and, that (3) almost surely randomness yields systems with non-recursively enumerable languages.

**Abstract:** Modern power systems are experiencing a variety of challenges driven by renewable energy, which calls for developing novel dispatch methods such as reinforcement learning (RL). Evaluation of these methods as well as the RL agents are largely under explored. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to analyze the performance of RL agents in a look-ahead economic dispatch scheme. This approach is conducted by scanning multiple operational scenarios. In particular, a scenario generation method is developed to generate the network scenarios and demand scenarios for evaluation, and network structures are aggregated according to the change rates of power flow. Then several metrics are defined to evaluate the agents' performance from the perspective of economy and security. In the case study, we use a modified IEEE 30-bus system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation approach, and the simulation results reveal good and rapid adaptation to different scenarios. The comparison between different RL agents is also informative to offer advice for a better design of the learning strategies.
