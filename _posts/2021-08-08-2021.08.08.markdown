**Abstract:** We introduce Pathfinder, a variational method for approximately sampling from differentiable log densities. Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL-divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.

**Abstract:** Event-based vision sensors achieve up to three orders of magnitude better speed vs. power consumption trade off in high-speed control of UAVs compared to conventional image sensors. Event-based cameras produce a sparse stream of events that can be processed more efficiently and with a lower latency than images, enabling ultra-fast vision-driven control. Here, we explore how an event-based vision algorithm can be implemented as a spiking neuronal network on a neuromorphic chip and used in a drone controller. We show how seamless integration of event-based perception on chip leads to even faster control rates and lower latency. In addition, we demonstrate how online adaptation of the SNN controller can be realised using on-chip learning. Our spiking neuronal network on chip is the first example of a neuromorphic vision-based controller solving a high-speed UAV control task. The excellent scalability of processing in neuromorphic hardware opens the possibility to solve more challenging visual tasks in the future and integrate visual perception in fast control loops.

**Abstract:** Visual understanding requires comprehending complex visual relations between objects within a scene. Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands for abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the ability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve the "Synthetic Visual Reasoning Test" (SVRT) challenge, a collection of twenty-three visual reasoning problems. Our analysis reveals a novel taxonomy of visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of relations (same-different vs. spatial-relation judgments) and the number of relations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience work suggests that attention plays a key role in humans' visual reasoning ability. To test this hypothesis, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based attention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the ability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and found the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the hardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most importantly, the corresponding improvements on individual tasks partially explained our novel taxonomy. Overall, this work provides an granular computational account of visual reasoning and yields testable neuroscience predictions regarding the differential need for feature-based vs. spatial attention depending on the type of visual reasoning problem.

**Abstract:** Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender systems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix factorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After recent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show state-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN concept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method of Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty in our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime, i) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed ones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF, and iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set of neural network connections. We also present a novel training method specialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets, Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better accuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442 by LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in Amazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth mentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather than linear connections.

**Abstract:** The recent emergence of reinforcement learning has created a demand for robust statistical inference methods for the parameter estimates computed using these algorithms. Existing methods for statistical inference in online learning are restricted to settings involving independently sampled observations, while existing statistical inference methods in reinforcement learning (RL) are limited to the batch setting. The online bootstrap is a flexible and efficient approach for statistical inference in linear stochastic approximation algorithms, but its efficacy in settings involving Markov noise, such as RL, has yet to be explored. In this paper, we study the use of the online bootstrap method for statistical inference in RL. In particular, we focus on the temporal difference (TD) learning and Gradient TD (GTD) learning algorithms, which are themselves special instances of linear stochastic approximation under Markov noise. The method is shown to be distributionally consistent for statistical inference in policy evaluation, and numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm at statistical inference tasks across a range of real RL environments.

**Abstract:** The goals of this paper are two-fold. The first goal is to serve as an expository tutorial on the working of deep learning models which emphasizes geometrical intuition about the reasons for success of deep learning. The second goal is to complement the current results on the expressive power of deep learning models and their loss surfaces with novel insights and results. In particular, we describe how deep neural networks carve out manifolds especially when the multiplication neurons are introduced. Multiplication is used in dot products and the attention mechanism and it is employed in capsule networks and self-attention based transformers. We also describe how random polynomial, random matrix, spin glass and computational complexity perspectives on the loss surfaces are interconnected.

**Abstract:** We train embodied neural networks to plan and navigate unseen complex 3D environments, emphasising real-world deployment. Rather than requiring prior knowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state transitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of reinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value Iteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert demonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two major limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current differentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high branching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to obstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the network are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently large penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural constraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any impossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited perspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real robot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view without rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map to aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational dynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our proposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several 2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging for this class of methods. As far as we know, we are the first to successfully perform differentiable planning on the difficult Active Vision Dataset, consisting of real images captured from a robot.

**Abstract:** Growing evidence from recent studies implies that microRNA or miRNA could serve as biomarkers in various complex human diseases. Since wet-lab experiments are expensive and time-consuming, computational techniques for miRNA-disease association prediction have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Data scarcity is one of the major challenges in building reliable machine learning models. Data scarcity combined with the use of precalculated hand-crafted input features has led to problems of overfitting and data leakage.
  We overcome the limitations of existing works by proposing a novel multi-tasking graph convolution-based approach, which we refer to as MuCoMiD. MuCoMiD allows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from five heterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between miRNA/diseases and protein-coding genes (PCG), interactions between protein-coding genes, miRNA family information, and disease ontology) in a multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has not been studied before. To effectively test the generalization capability of our model, we construct large-scale experiments on standard benchmark datasets as well as our proposed larger independent test sets and case studies. MuCoMiD shows an improvement of at least 3% in 5-fold CV evaluation on HMDDv2.0 and HMDDv3.0 datasets and at least 35% on larger independent test sets with unseen miRNA and diseases over state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** With active research in audio compression techniques yielding substantial breakthroughs, spectral reconstruction of low-quality audio waves remains a less indulged topic. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing higher frequencies from considerably longer sequences of low-quality MP3 audio waves. Our technique involves inpainting audio spectrograms with residually stacked autoencoder blocks by manipulating individual amplitude and phase values in relation to perceptual differences. Our architecture presents several bottlenecks while preserving the spectral structure of the audio wave via skip-connections. We also compare several task metrics and demonstrate our visual guide to loss selection. Moreover, we show how to leverage differential quantization techniques to reduce the initial model size by more than half while simultaneously reducing inference time, which is crucial in real-world applications.

**Abstract:** Explanation of AI, as well as fairness of algorithms' decisions and the transparency of the decision model, are becoming more and more important. And it is crucial to design effective and human-friendly techniques when opening the black-box model. Counterfactual conforms to the human way of thinking and provides a human-friendly explanation, and its corresponding explanation algorithm refers to a strategic alternation of a given data point so that its model output is "counter-facted", i.e. the prediction is reverted. In this paper, we adapt counterfactual explanation over fine-grained image classification problem. We demonstrated an adaptive method that could give a counterfactual explanation by showing the composed counterfactual feature map using top-down layer searching algorithm (TDLS). We have proved that our TDLS algorithm could provide more flexible counterfactual visual explanation in an efficient way using VGG-16 model on Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset. At the end, we discussed several applicable scenarios of counterfactual visual explanations.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel lightweight COVID-19 diagnosis framework using CT scans. Our system utilises a novel two-stage approach to generate robust and efficient diagnoses across heterogeneous patient level inputs. We use a powerful backbone network as a feature extractor to capture discriminative slice-level features. These features are aggregated by a lightweight network to obtain a patient level diagnosis. The aggregation network is carefully designed to have a small number of trainable parameters while also possessing sufficient capacity to generalise to diverse variations within different CT volumes and to adapt to noise introduced during the data acquisition. We achieve a significant performance increase over the baselines when benchmarked on the SPGC COVID-19 Radiomics Dataset, despite having only 2.5 million trainable parameters and requiring only 0.623 seconds on average to process a single patient's CT volume using an Nvidia-GeForce RTX 2080 GPU.

**Abstract:** We present a novel approach to joint depth and normal estimation for time-of-flight (ToF) sensors. Our model learns to predict the high-quality depth and normal maps jointly from ToF raw sensor data. To achieve this, we meticulously constructed the first large-scale dataset (named ToF-100) with paired raw ToF data and ground-truth high-resolution depth maps provided by an industrial depth camera. In addition, we also design a simple but effective framework for joint depth and normal estimation, applying a robust Chamfer loss via jittering to improve the performance of our model. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently reconstruct high-resolution depth and normal maps and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** Efficient GPU resource scheduling is essential to maximize resource utilization and save training costs for the increasing amount of deep learning workloads in shared GPU clusters. Existing GPU schedulers largely rely on static policies to leverage the performance characteristics of deep learning jobs. However, they can hardly reach optimal efficiency due to the lack of elasticity. To address the problem, we propose ONES, an ONline Evolutionary Scheduler for elastic batch size orchestration. ONES automatically manages the elasticity of each job based on the training batch size, so as to maximize GPU utilization and improve scheduling efficiency. It determines the batch size for each job through an online evolutionary search that can continuously optimize the scheduling decisions. We evaluate the effectiveness of ONES with 64 GPUs on TACC's Longhorn supercomputers. The results show that ONES can outperform the prior deep learning schedulers with a significantly shorter average job completion time.

<p>

**Abstract:** Substantial increase in the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has opened new frontiers for predictive healthcare. However, while EHR systems are nearly ubiquitous, they lack a unified code system for representing medical concepts. Heterogeneous formats of EHR present a substantial barrier for the training and deployment of state-of-the-art deep learning models at scale. To overcome this problem, we introduce Description-based Embedding, DescEmb, a code-agnostic description-based representation learning framework for predictive modeling on EHR. DescEmb takes advantage of the flexibility of neural language understanding models while maintaining a neutral approach that can be combined with prior frameworks for task-specific representation learning or predictive modeling. We tested our model's capacity on various experiments including prediction tasks, transfer learning and pooled learning. DescEmb shows higher performance in overall experiments compared to code-based approach, opening the door to a text-based approach in predictive healthcare research that is not constrained by EHR structure nor special domain knowledge.

**Abstract:** Incremental learning of semantic segmentation has emerged as a promising strategy for visual scene interpretation in the open- world setting. However, it remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the segmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label space, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data availability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy that can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting, using a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only. To this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative relabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based incremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model. Moreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select informative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the incremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning. We validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, and the results demonstrate its superior performance over the existing incremental methods.

**Abstract:** Social media like Twitter provide a common platform to share and communicate personal experiences with other people. People often post their life experiences, local news, and events on social media to inform others. Many rescue agencies monitor this type of data regularly to identify disasters and reduce the risk of lives. However, it is impossible for humans to manually check the mass amount of data and identify disasters in real-time. For this purpose, many research works have been proposed to present words in machine-understandable representations and apply machine learning methods on the word representations to identify the sentiment of a text. The previous research methods provide a single representation or embedding of a word from a given document. However, the recent advanced contextual embedding method (BERT) constructs different vectors for the same word in different contexts. BERT embeddings have been successfully used in different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet there is no concrete analysis of how these representations are helpful in disaster-type tweet analysis. In this research work, we explore the efficacy of BERT embeddings on predicting disaster from Twitter data and compare these to traditional context-free word embedding methods (GloVe, Skip-gram, and FastText). We use both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods for this purpose. We provide both quantitative and qualitative results for this study. The results show that the BERT embeddings have the best results in disaster prediction task than the traditional word embeddings. Our codes are made freely accessible to the research community.

**Abstract:** Geohazards such as landslides have caused great losses to the safety of people's lives and property, which is often accompanied with surface cracks. If such surface cracks could be identified in time, it is of great significance for the monitoring and early warning of geohazards. Currently, the most common method for crack identification is manual detection, which is with low efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, a deep transfer learning framework is proposed to effectively and efficiently identify slope surface cracks for the sake of fast monitoring and early warning of geohazards such as landslides. The essential idea is to employ transfer learning by training (a) the large sample dataset of concrete cracks and (b) the small sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks. In the proposed framework, (1) pretrained cracks identification models are constructed based on the large sample dataset of concrete cracks; (2) refined cracks identification models are further constructed based on the small sample dataset of soil and rock masses cracks. The proposed framework could be applied to conduct UAV surveys on high-steep slopes to realize the monitoring and early warning of landslides to ensure the safety of people's lives and property.

**Abstract:** Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest CT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of automatic lungs segmentation, localization/ isolation of lung abnormalities, followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view and provides the attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and evaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.

**Abstract:** Widespread and rapid dissemination of false news has made fact-checking an indispensable requirement. Given its time-consuming and labor-intensive nature, the task calls for an automated support to meet the demand. In this paper, we propose to leverage commonsense knowledge for the tasks of false news classification and check-worthy claim detection. Arguing that commonsense knowledge is a factor in human believability, we fine-tune the BERT language model with a commonsense question answering task and the aforementioned tasks in a multi-task learning environment. For predicting fine-grained false news types, we compare the proposed fine-tuned model's performance with the false news classification models on a public dataset as well as a newly collected dataset. We compare the model's performance with the single-task BERT model and a state-of-the-art check-worthy claim detection tool to evaluate the check-worthy claim detection. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that commonsense knowledge can improve performance in both tasks.

**Abstract:** We introduce the task of open-vocabulary visual instance search (OVIS). Given an arbitrary textual search query, Open-vocabulary Visual Instance Search (OVIS) aims to return a ranked list of visual instances, i.e., image patches, that satisfies the search intent from an image database. The term "open vocabulary" means that there are neither restrictions to the visual instance to be searched nor restrictions to the word that can be used to compose the textual search query. We propose to address such a search challenge via visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary textual query. To evaluate the performance of ViSA, we build two datasets named OVIS40 and OVIS1600 and also introduce a pipeline for error analysis. Through extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to search for visual instances in images not available during training given a wide range of textual queries including those composed of uncommon words. Experimental results show that ViSA achieves an mAP@50 of 21.9% on OVIS40 under the most challenging setting and achieves an mAP@6 of 14.9% on OVIS1600 dataset.

**Abstract:** Although deep learning based image compression methods have achieved promising progress these days, the performance of these methods still cannot match the latest compression standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Most of the recent developments focus on designing a more accurate and flexible entropy model that can better parameterize the distributions of the latent features. However, few efforts are devoted to structuring a better transformation between the image space and the latent feature space. In this paper, instead of employing previous autoencoder style networks to build this transformation, we propose an enhanced Invertible Encoding Network with invertible neural networks (INNs) to largely mitigate the information loss problem for better compression. Experimental results on the Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets show that our method outperforms the existing learned image compression methods and compression standards, including VVC (VTM 12.1), especially for high-resolution images. Our source code is available at https://github.com/xyq7/InvCompress.

<p>

**Abstract:** We study the problem of deconvolution for light-sheet microscopy, where the data is corrupted by spatially varying blur and a combination of Poisson and Gaussian noise. The spatial variation of the point spread function (PSF) of a light-sheet microscope is determined by the interaction between the excitation sheet and the detection objective PSF. First, we introduce a model of the image formation process that incorporates this interaction, therefore capturing the main characteristics of this imaging modality. Then, we formulate a variational model that accounts for the combination of Poisson and Gaussian noise through a data fidelity term consisting of the infimal convolution of the single noise fidelities, first introduced in L. Calatroni et al. "Infimal convolution of data discrepancies for mixed noise removal", SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences 10.3 (2017), 1196-1233. We establish convergence rates in a Bregman distance under a source condition for the infimal convolution fidelity and a discrepancy principle for choosing the value of the regularisation parameter. The inverse problem is solved by applying the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm in a novel way. Finally, numerical experiments performed on both simulated and real data show superior reconstruction results in comparison with other methods.

**Abstract:** Although current state-of-the-art language models have achieved impressive results in numerous natural language processing tasks, still they could not solve the problem of producing repetitive, dull and sometimes inconsistent text in open-ended text generation. Studies often attribute this problem to the maximum likelihood training objective, and propose alternative approaches by using stochastic decoding methods or altering the training objective. However, there is still a lack of consistent evaluation metrics to directly compare the efficacy of these solutions. In this work, we study different evaluation metrics that have been proposed to evaluate quality, diversity and consistency of machine-generated text. From there, we propose a practical pipeline to evaluate language models in open-ended generation task, and research on how to improve the model's performance in all dimensions by leveraging different auxiliary training objectives.

**Abstract:** The online estimation of rhythmic information, such as beat positions, downbeat positions, and meter, is critical for many real-time music applications. Musical rhythm comprises complex hierarchical relationships across time, rendering its analysis intrinsically challenging and at times subjective. Furthermore, systems which attempt to estimate rhythmic information in real-time must be causal and must produce estimates quickly and efficiently. In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter tracking, which utilizes causal convolutional and recurrent layers, followed by a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The proposed system does not need to be primed with a time signature in order to perform downbeat tracking, and is instead able to estimate meter and adjust the predictions over time. Additionally, we propose an information gate strategy to significantly decrease the computational cost of particle filtering during the inference step, making the system much faster than previous sampling-based methods. Experiments on the GTZAN dataset, which is unseen during training, show that the system outperforms various online beat and downbeat tracking systems and achieves comparable performance to a baseline offline joint method.

**Abstract:** Many researchers have studied student academic performance in supervised and unsupervised learning using numerous data mining techniques. Neural networks often need a greater collection of observations to achieve enough predictive ability. Due to the increase in the rate of poor graduates, it is necessary to design a system that helps to reduce this menace as well as reduce the incidence of students having to repeat due to poor performance or having to drop out of school altogether in the middle of the pursuit of their career. It is therefore necessary to study each one as well as their advantages and disadvantages, so as to determine which is more efficient in and in what case one should be preferred over the other. The study aims to develop a system to predict student performance with Artificial Neutral Network using the student demographic traits so as to assist the university in selecting candidates (students) with a high prediction of success for admission using previous academic records of students granted admissions which will eventually lead to quality graduates of the institution. The model was developed based on certain selected variables as the input. It achieved an accuracy of over 92.3 percent, showing Artificial Neural Network potential effectiveness as a predictive tool and a selection criterion for candidates seeking admission to a university.

**Abstract:** Code Smell, similar to a bad smell, is a surface indication of something tainted but in terms of software writing practices. This metric is an indication of a deeper problem lies within the code and is associated with an issue which is prominent to experienced software developers with acceptable coding practices. Recent studies have often observed that codes having code smells are often prone to a higher probability of change in the software development cycle. In this paper, we developed code smell prediction models with the help of features extracted from source code to predict eight types of code smell. Our work also presents the application of data sampling techniques to handle class imbalance problem and feature selection techniques to find relevant feature sets. Previous studies had made use of techniques such as Naive - Bayes and Random forest but had not explored deep learning methods to predict code smell. A total of 576 distinct Deep Learning models were trained using the features and datasets mentioned above. The study concluded that the deep learning models which used data from Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique gave better results in terms of accuracy, AUC with the accuracy of some models improving from 88.47 to 96.84.

**Abstract:** A code smell is a surface indicator of an inherent problem in the system, most often due to deviation from standard coding practices on the developers part during the development phase. Studies observe that code smells made the code more susceptible to call for modifications and corrections than code that did not contain code smells. Restructuring the code at the early stage of development saves the exponentially increasing amount of effort it would require to address the issues stemming from the presence of these code smells. Instead of using traditional features to detect code smells, we use user comments to manually construct features to predict code smells. We use three Extreme learning machine kernels over 629 packages to identify eight code smells by leveraging feature engineering aspects and using sampling techniques. Our findings indicate that the radial basis functional kernel performs best out of the three kernel methods with a mean accuracy of 98.52.

**Abstract:** Recent state-of-the-art artificial agents lack the ability to adapt rapidly to new tasks, as they are trained exclusively for specific objectives and require massive amounts of interaction to learn new skills. Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) addresses this challenge by leveraging knowledge learned from training tasks to perform well in previously unseen tasks. However, current meta-RL approaches limit themselves to narrow parametric task distributions, ignoring qualitative differences between tasks that occur in the real world. In this paper, we introduce TIGR, a Task-Inference-based meta-RL algorithm using Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and gated Recurrent units, designed for tasks in non-parametric environments. We employ a generative model involving a GMM to capture the multi-modality of the tasks. We decouple the policy training from the task-inference learning and efficiently train the inference mechanism on the basis of an unsupervised reconstruction objective. We provide a benchmark with qualitatively distinct tasks based on the half-cheetah environment and demonstrate the superior performance of TIGR compared to state-of-the-art meta-RL approaches in terms of sample efficiency (3-10 times faster), asymptotic performance, and applicability in non-parametric environments with zero-shot adaptation.

**Abstract:** As an image sensing instrument, light field images can supply extra angular information compared with monocular images and have facilitated a wide range of measurement applications. Light field image capturing devices usually suffer from the inherent trade-off between the angular and spatial resolutions. To tackle this problem, several methods, such as light field reconstruction and light field super-resolution, have been proposed but leaving two problems unaddressed, namely domain asymmetry and efficient information flow. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Spatio-Angular Dense Network (SADenseNet) for light field reconstruction with two novel components, namely correlation blocks and spatio-angular dense skip connections to address them. The former performs effective modeling of the correlation information in a way that conforms with the domain asymmetry. And the latter consists of three kinds of connections enhancing the information flow within two domains. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed SADenseNet's state-of-the-art performance at significantly reduced costs in memory and computation. The qualitative results show that the reconstructed light field images are sharp with correct details and can serve as pre-processing to improve the accuracy of related measurement applications.

**Abstract:** Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), which usually utilizes machine learning methods and is effective in disaggregating smart meter readings from the household-level into appliance-level consumptions, can help to analyze electricity consumption behaviours of users and enable practical smart energy and smart grid applications. However, smart meters are privately owned and distributed, which make real-world applications of NILM challenging. To this end, this paper develops a distributed and privacy-preserving federated deep learning framework for NILM (FederatedNILM), which combines federated learning with a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture to conduct NILM for the classification of typical states of household appliances. Through extensive comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed FederatedNILM framework is demonstrated.

**Abstract:** Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a very common problem in the field of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and losses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly detection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the process of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention systems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to address this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with some generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which incorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of new and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution strategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a subgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise architecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer depths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of the anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully automated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection model is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy.

**Abstract:** In 1-bit compressive sensing, each measurement is quantized to a single bit, namely the sign of a linear function of an unknown vector, and the goal is to accurately recover the vector. While it is most popular to assume a standard Gaussian sensing matrix for 1-bit compressive sensing, using structured sensing matrices such as partial Gaussian circulant matrices is of significant practical importance due to their faster matrix operations. In this paper, we provide recovery guarantees for a correlation-based optimization algorithm for robust 1-bit compressive sensing with randomly signed partial Gaussian circulant matrices and generative models. Under suitable assumptions, we match guarantees that were previously only known to hold for i.i.d.~Gaussian matrices that require significantly more computation. We make use of a practical iterative algorithm, and perform numerical experiments on image datasets to corroborate our theoretical results.

**Abstract:** This paper tackles the data-driven approximation of unknown dynamical systems using Koopman-operator methods. Given a dictionary of functions, these methods approximate the projection of the action of the operator on the finite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable Symmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing its expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of the dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and accuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based on the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact predictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of invariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a data-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm iteratively prunes the initial functional space to identify a refined dictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while retaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full characterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition. Simulations on planar systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in producing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant information about the dynamical system.
