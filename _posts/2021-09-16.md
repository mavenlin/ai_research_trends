**Abstract:** In this paper, human semen samples from the visem dataset collected by the Simula Research Laboratory are automatically assessed with machine learning methods for their quality in respect to sperm motility. Several regression models are trained to automatically predict the percentage (0 to 100) of progressive, non-progressive, and immotile spermatozoa in a given sample. The video samples are adopted for three different feature extraction methods, in particular custom movement statistics, displacement features, and motility specific statistics have been utilised. Furthermore, four machine learning models, including linear Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), have been trained on the extracted features for the task of automatic motility prediction. Best results for predicting motility are achieved by using the Crocker-Grier algorithm to track sperm cells in an unsupervised way and extracting individual mean squared displacement features for each detected track. These features are then aggregated into a histogram representation applying a Bag-of-Words approach. Finally, a linear SVR is trained on this feature representation. Compared to the best submission of the Medico Multimedia for Medicine challenge, which used the same dataset and splits, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) could be reduced from 8.83 to 7.31. For the sake of reproducibility, we provide the source code for our experiments on GitHub.

**Abstract:** We propose 3DETR, an end-to-end Transformer based object detection model for 3D point clouds. Compared to existing detection methods that employ a number of 3D-specific inductive biases, 3DETR requires minimal modifications to the vanilla Transformer block. Specifically, we find that a standard Transformer with non-parametric queries and Fourier positional embeddings is competitive with specialized architectures that employ libraries of 3D-specific operators with hand-tuned hyperparameters. Nevertheless, 3DETR is conceptually simple and easy to implement, enabling further improvements by incorporating 3D domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we show 3DETR outperforms the well-established and highly optimized VoteNet baselines on the challenging ScanNetV2 dataset by 9.5%. Furthermore, we show 3DETR is applicable to 3D tasks beyond detection, and can serve as a building block for future research.

**Abstract:** We present an empirical study of scaling properties of encoder-decoder Transformer models used in neural machine translation (NMT). We show that cross-entropy loss as a function of model size follows a certain scaling law. Specifically (i) We propose a formula which describes the scaling behavior of cross-entropy loss as a bivariate function of encoder and decoder size, and show that it gives accurate predictions under a variety of scaling approaches and languages; we show that the total number of parameters alone is not sufficient for such purposes. (ii) We observe different power law exponents when scaling the decoder vs scaling the encoder, and provide recommendations for optimal allocation of encoder/decoder capacity based on this observation. (iii) We also report that the scaling behavior of the model is acutely influenced by composition bias of the train/test sets, which we define as any deviation from naturally generated text (either via machine generated or human translated text). We observe that natural text on the target side enjoys scaling, which manifests as successful reduction of the cross-entropy loss. (iv) Finally, we investigate the relationship between the cross-entropy loss and the quality of the generated translations. We find two different behaviors, depending on the nature of the test data. For test sets which were originally translated from target language to source language, both loss and BLEU score improve as model size increases. In contrast, for test sets originally translated from source language to target language, the loss improves, but the BLEU score stops improving after a certain threshold. We release generated text from all models used in this study.

<p>

**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is an emerging fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to extract aspects, classify corresponding sentiment polarities and find opinions as the causes of sentiment. The latest research tends to solve the ABSA task in a unified way with end-to-end frameworks. Yet, these frameworks get fine-tuned from downstream tasks without any task-adaptive modification. Specifically, they do not use task-related knowledge well or explicitly model relations between aspect and opinion terms, hindering them from better performance. In this paper, we propose SentiPrompt to use sentiment knowledge enhanced prompts to tune the language model in the unified framework. We inject sentiment knowledge regarding aspects, opinions, and polarities into prompt and explicitly model term relations via constructing consistency and polarity judgment templates from the ground truth triplets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can outperform strong baselines on Triplet Extraction, Pair Extraction, and Aspect Term Extraction with Sentiment Classification by a notable margin.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose a computationally-friendly adaptive learning rate schedule, "AdaLoss", which directly uses the information of the loss function to adjust the stepsize in gradient descent methods. We prove that this schedule enjoys linear convergence in linear regression. Moreover, we provide a linear convergence guarantee over the non-convex regime, in the context of two-layer over-parameterized neural networks. If the width of the first-hidden layer in the two-layer networks is sufficiently large (polynomially), then AdaLoss converges robustly \emph{to the global minimum} in polynomial time. We numerically verify the theoretical results and extend the scope of the numerical experiments by considering applications in LSTM models for text clarification and policy gradients for control problems.

**Abstract:** We present distributed algorithms for training dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNN) on large scale graphs spanning multi-node, multi-GPU systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scaling study on dynamic GNN. We devise mechanisms for reducing the GPU memory usage and identify two execution time bottlenecks: CPU-GPU data transfer; and communication volume. Exploiting properties of dynamic graphs, we design a graph difference-based strategy to significantly reduce the transfer time. We develop a simple, but effective data distribution technique under which the communication volume remains fixed and linear in the input size, for any number of GPUs. Our experiments using billion-size graphs on a system of 128 GPUs shows that: (i) the distribution scheme achieves up to 30x speedup on 128 GPUs; (ii) the graph-difference technique reduces the transfer time by a factor of up to 4.1x and the overall execution time by up to 40%

**Abstract:** Multisensory object-centric perception, reasoning, and interaction have been a key research topic in recent years. However, the progress in these directions is limited by the small set of objects available -- synthetic objects are not realistic enough and are mostly centered around geometry, while real object datasets such as YCB are often practically challenging and unstable to acquire due to international shipping, inventory, and financial cost. We present ObjectFolder, a dataset of 100 virtualized objects that addresses both challenges with two key innovations. First, ObjectFolder encodes the visual, auditory, and tactile sensory data for all objects, enabling a number of multisensory object recognition tasks, beyond existing datasets that focus purely on object geometry. Second, ObjectFolder employs a uniform, object-centric, and implicit representation for each object's visual textures, acoustic simulations, and tactile readings, making the dataset flexible to use and easy to share. We demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset as a testbed for multisensory perception and control by evaluating it on a variety of benchmark tasks, including instance recognition, cross-sensory retrieval, 3D reconstruction, and robotic grasping.

**Abstract:** Strategic classification studies the design of a classifier robust to the manipulation of input by strategic individuals. However, the existing literature does not consider the effect of competition among individuals as induced by the algorithm design. Motivated by constrained allocation settings such as college admissions, we introduce strategic ranking, in which the (designed) individual reward depends on an applicant's post-effort rank in a measurement of interest. Our results illustrate how competition among applicants affects the resulting equilibria and model insights. We analyze how various ranking reward designs trade off applicant, school, and societal utility and in particular how ranking design can counter inequities arising from disparate access to resources to improve one's measured score: We find that randomization in the ranking reward design can mitigate two measures of disparate impact, welfare gap and access, whereas non-randomization may induce a high level of competition that systematically excludes a disadvantaged group.

**Abstract:** We introduce the task of stereo video reconstruction or, equivalently, 2D-to-3D video conversion for minimally invasive surgical video. We design and implement a series of end-to-end U-Net-based solutions for this task by varying the input (single frame vs. multiple consecutive frames), loss function (MSE, MAE, or perceptual losses), and network architecture. We evaluate these solutions by surveying ten experts - surgeons who routinely perform endoscopic surgery. We run two separate reader studies: one evaluating individual frames and the other evaluating fully reconstructed 3D video played on a VR headset. In the first reader study, a variant of the U-Net that takes as input multiple consecutive video frames and outputs the missing view performs best. We draw two conclusions from this outcome. First, motion information coming from multiple past frames is crucial in recreating stereo vision. Second, the proposed U-Net variant can indeed exploit such motion information for solving this task. The result from the second study further confirms the effectiveness of the proposed U-Net variant. The surgeons reported that they could successfully perceive depth from the reconstructed 3D video clips. They also expressed a clear preference for the reconstructed 3D video over the original 2D video. These two reader studies strongly support the usefulness of the proposed task of stereo reconstruction for minimally invasive surgical video and indicate that deep learning is a promising approach to this task. Finally, we identify two automatic metrics, LPIPS and DISTS, that are strongly correlated with expert judgement and that could serve as proxies for the latter in future studies.

**Abstract:** Interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to compiler optimizations is increasing rapidly, but compiler research has a high entry barrier. Unlike in other domains, compiler and AI researchers do not have access to the datasets and frameworks that enable fast iteration and development of ideas, and getting started requires a significant engineering investment. What is needed is an easy, reusable experimental infrastructure for real world compiler optimization tasks that can serve as a common benchmark for comparing techniques, and as a platform to accelerate progress in the field.
  We introduce CompilerGym, a set of environments for real world compiler optimization tasks, and a toolkit for exposing new optimization tasks to compiler researchers. CompilerGym enables anyone to experiment on production compiler optimization problems through an easy-to-use package, regardless of their experience with compilers. We build upon the popular OpenAI Gym interface enabling researchers to interact with compilers using Python and a familiar API.
  We describe the CompilerGym architecture and implementation, characterize the optimization spaces and computational efficiencies of three included compiler environments, and provide extensive empirical evaluations. Compared to prior works, CompilerGym offers larger datasets and optimization spaces, is 27x more computationally efficient, is fault-tolerant, and capable of detecting reproducibility bugs in the underlying compilers.
  In making it easy for anyone to experiment with compilers - irrespective of their background - we aim to accelerate progress in the AI and compiler research domains.

**Abstract:** The recent success of deep learning models in solving complex problems and in different domains has increased interest in understanding what they learn. Therefore, different approaches have been employed to explain these models, one of which uses human-understandable concepts as explanations. Two examples of methods that use this approach are Network Dissection and Compositional explanations. The former explains units using atomic concepts, while the latter makes explanations more expressive, replacing atomic concepts with logical forms. While intuitively, logical forms are more informative than atomic concepts, it is not clear how to quantify this improvement, and their evaluation is often based on the same metric that is optimized during the search-process and on the usage of hyper-parameters to be tuned. In this paper, we propose to use as evaluation metric the Detection Accuracy, which measures units' consistency of detection of their assigned explanations. We show that this metric (1) evaluates explanations of different lengths effectively, (2) can be used as a stopping criterion for the compositional explanation search, eliminating the explanation length hyper-parameter, and (3) exposes new specialized units whose length 1 explanations are the perceptual abstractions of their longer explanations.

**Abstract:** The importance and pervasiveness of emotions in our lives makes affective computing a tremendously important and vibrant line of work. Systems for automatic emotion recognition (AER) and sentiment analysis can be facilitators of enormous progress (e.g., in improving public health and commerce) but also enablers of great harm (e.g., for suppressing dissidents and manipulating voters). Thus, it is imperative that the affective computing community actively engage with the ethical ramifications of their creations. In this paper, I have synthesized and organized information from AI Ethics and Emotion Recognition literature to present fifty ethical considerations relevant to AER. Notably, the sheet fleshes out assumptions hidden in how AER is commonly framed, and in the choices often made regarding the data, method, and evaluation. Special attention is paid to the implications of AER on privacy and social groups. The objective of the sheet is to facilitate and encourage more thoughtfulness on why to automate, how to automate, and how to judge success well before the building of AER systems. Additionally, the sheet acts as a useful introductory document on emotion recognition (complementing survey articles).

**Abstract:** Disentangling data into interpretable and independent factors is critical for controllable generation tasks. With the availability of labeled data, supervision can help enforce the separation of specific factors as expected. However, it is often expensive or even impossible to label every single factor to achieve fully-supervised disentanglement. In this paper, we adopt a general setting where all factors that are hard to label or identify are encapsulated as a single unknown factor. Under this setting, we propose a flexible weakly-supervised multi-factor disentanglement framework DisUnknown, which Distills Unknown factors for enabling multi-conditional generation regarding both labeled and unknown factors. Specifically, a two-stage training approach is adopted to first disentangle the unknown factor with an effective and robust training method, and then train the final generator with the proper disentanglement of all labeled factors utilizing the unknown distillation. To demonstrate the generalization capacity and scalability of our method, we evaluate it on multiple benchmark datasets qualitatively and quantitatively and further apply it to various real-world applications on complicated datasets.

**Abstract:** Recently, recommender systems have achieved promising performances and become one of the most widely used web applications. However, recommender systems are often trained on highly sensitive user data, thus potential data leakage from recommender systems may lead to severe privacy problems.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt on quantifying the privacy leakage of recommender systems through the lens of membership inference. In contrast with traditional membership inference against machine learning classifiers, our attack faces two main differences. First, our attack is on the user-level but not on the data sample-level. Second, the adversary can only observe the ordered recommended items from a recommender system instead of prediction results in the form of posterior probabilities. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method by representing users from relevant items. Moreover, a shadow recommender is established to derive the labeled training data for training the attack model. Extensive experimental results show that our attack framework achieves a strong performance. In addition, we design a defense mechanism to effectively mitigate the membership inference threat of recommender systems.

**Abstract:** Recent interest in Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) has led to a plethora of approaches based on reinforcement learning, inductive logic programming and graph embeddings. In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules while being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within rule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying quality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these differences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the non-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few paths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all rule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that learn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of paths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by extending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to superior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in terms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of relation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving our results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.

**Abstract:** Numerical reasoning based machine reading comprehension is a task that involves reading comprehension along with using arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, sorting, and counting. The DROP benchmark (Dua et al., 2019) is a recent dataset that has inspired the design of NLP models aimed at solving this task. The current standings of these models in the DROP leaderboard, over standard metrics, suggest that the models have achieved near-human performance. However, does this mean that these models have learned to reason? In this paper, we present a controlled study on some of the top-performing model architectures for the task of numerical reasoning. Our observations suggest that the standard metrics are incapable of measuring progress towards such tasks.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of complementary fashion prediction. Existing approaches focus on learning an embedding space where fashion items from different categories that are visually compatible are closer to each other. However, creating such labeled outfits is intensive and also not feasible to generate all possible outfit combinations, especially with large fashion catalogs. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach where we leverage large unlabeled fashion corpus to create pseudo-positive and pseudo-negative outfits on the fly during training. For each labeled outfit in a training batch, we obtain a pseudo-outfit by matching each item in the labeled outfit with unlabeled items. Additionally, we introduce consistency regularization to ensure that representation of the original images and their transformations are consistent to implicitly incorporate colour and other important attributes through self-supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on Polyvore, Polyvore-D and our newly created large-scale Fashion Outfits datasets, and show that our approach with only a fraction of labeled examples performs on-par with completely supervised methods.

**Abstract:** In this work, we present Eformer - Edge enhancement based transformer, a novel architecture that builds an encoder-decoder network using transformer blocks for medical image denoising. Non-overlapping window-based self-attention is used in the transformer block that reduces computational requirements. This work further incorporates learnable Sobel-Feldman operators to enhance edges in the image and propose an effective way to concatenate them in the intermediate layers of our architecture. The experimental analysis is conducted by comparing deterministic learning and residual learning for the task of medical image denoising. To defend the effectiveness of our approach, our model is evaluated on the AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge Dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance, $i.e.$, 43.487 PSNR, 0.0067 RMSE, and 0.9861 SSIM. We believe that our work will encourage more research in transformer-based architectures for medical image denoising using residual learning.

<p>

**Abstract:** Effective robot learning often requires online human feedback and interventions that can cost significant human time, giving rise to the central challenge in interactive imitation learning: is it possible to control the timing and length of interventions to both facilitate learning and limit burden on the human supervisor? This paper presents ThriftyDAgger, an algorithm for actively querying a human supervisor given a desired budget of human interventions. ThriftyDAgger uses a learned switching policy to solicit interventions only at states that are sufficiently (1) novel, where the robot policy has no reference behavior to imitate, or (2) risky, where the robot has low confidence in task completion. To detect the latter, we introduce a novel metric for estimating risk under the current robot policy. Experiments in simulation and on a physical cable routing experiment suggest that ThriftyDAgger's intervention criteria balances task performance and supervisor burden more effectively than prior algorithms. ThriftyDAgger can also be applied at execution time, where it achieves a 100% success rate on both the simulation and physical tasks. A user study (N=10) in which users control a three-robot fleet while also performing a concentration task suggests that ThriftyDAgger increases human and robot performance by 58% and 80% respectively compared to the next best algorithm while reducing supervisor burden.

**Abstract:** A variety of techniques have been proposed to train machine learning classifiers that are independent of a given feature. While this can be an essential technique for enabling background estimation, it may also be useful for reducing uncertainties. We carefully examine theory uncertainties, which typically do not have a statistical origin. We will provide explicit examples of two-point (fragmentation modeling) and continuous (higher-order corrections) uncertainties where decorrelating significantly reduces the apparent uncertainty while the actual uncertainty is much larger. These results suggest that caution should be taken when using decorrelation for these types of uncertainties as long as we do not have a complete decomposition into statistically meaningful components.

**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have shown promising results in domains where abundant pre-collected data is available. However, prior methods focus on solving individual problems from scratch with an offline dataset without considering how an offline RL agent can acquire multiple skills. We argue that a natural use case of offline RL is in settings where we can pool large amounts of data collected in various scenarios for solving different tasks, and utilize all of this data to learn behaviors for all the tasks more effectively rather than training each one in isolation. However, sharing data across all tasks in multi-task offline RL performs surprisingly poorly in practice. Thorough empirical analysis, we find that sharing data can actually exacerbate the distributional shift between the learned policy and the dataset, which in turn can lead to divergence of the learned policy and poor performance. To address this challenge, we develop a simple technique for data-sharing in multi-task offline RL that routes data based on the improvement over the task-specific data. We call this approach conservative data sharing (CDS), and it can be applied with multiple single-task offline RL methods. On a range of challenging multi-task locomotion, navigation, and vision-based robotic manipulation problems, CDS achieves the best or comparable performance compared to prior offline multi-task RL methods and previous data sharing approaches.

**Abstract:** How can model designers turn task instructions into effective prompts for language models? Backed by extensive empirical analysis on GPT3, we observe important features for successful instructional prompts, and propose several reframing techniques for model designers to create such prompts. For example, a complex task can be decomposed into multiple simpler tasks. We experiment over 12 NLP tasks across 6 diverse categories (question generation, classification, etc.). Our results show that reframing improves few-shot and zero-shot learning performance by 14% and 17% respectively while reducing sample complexity over other recent few-shot baselines. The performance gains are particularly important on large language models, such as GPT3 where tuning models or prompts on large datasets is not feasible. Furthermore, we observe that such gains are not limited to GPT3; the reframed tasks remain superior over raw instructions across different model architectures, underscoring the cross-model generality of these guidelines. We hope these empirical-driven techniques will pave way for more effective ways to prompt LMs in the future.

**Abstract:** Semi-supervised learning provides great significance in left atrium (LA) segmentation model learning with insufficient labelled data. Generalising semi-supervised learning to cross-domain data is of high importance to further improve model robustness. However, the widely existing distribution difference and sample mismatch between different data domains hinder the generalisation of semi-supervised learning. In this study, we alleviate these problems by proposing an Adaptive Hierarchical Dual Consistency (AHDC) for the semi-supervised LA segmentation on cross-domain data. The AHDC mainly consists of a Bidirectional Adversarial Inference module (BAI) and a Hierarchical Dual Consistency learning module (HDC). The BAI overcomes the difference of distributions and the sample mismatch between two different domains. It mainly learns two mapping networks adversarially to obtain two matched domains through mutual adaptation. The HDC investigates a hierarchical dual learning paradigm for cross-domain semi-supervised segmentation based on the obtained matched domains. It mainly builds two dual-modelling networks for mining the complementary information in both intra-domain and inter-domain. For the intra-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the dual-modelling targets to exploit the complementary modelling information. For the inter-domain learning, a consistency constraint is applied to the LAs modelled by two dual-modelling networks to exploit the complementary knowledge among different data domains. We demonstrated the performance of our proposed AHDC on four 3D late gadolinium enhancement cardiac MR (LGE-CMR) datasets from different centres and a 3D CT dataset. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed AHDC achieved higher segmentation accuracy, which indicated its capability in the cross-domain semi-supervised LA segmentation.

**Abstract:** Geo-tagged photo based tourist attraction recommendation can discover users' travel preferences from their taken photos, so as to recommend suitable tourist attractions to them. However, existing visual content based methods cannot fully exploit the user and tourist attraction information of photos to extract visual features, and do not differentiate the significances of different photos. In this paper, we propose multi-level visual similarity based personalized tourist attraction recommendation using geo-tagged photos (MEAL). MEAL utilizes the visual contents of photos and interaction behavior data to obtain the final embeddings of users and tourist attractions, which are then used to predict the visit probabilities. Specifically, by crossing the user and tourist attraction information of photos, we define four visual similarity levels and introduce a corresponding quintuplet loss to embed the visual contents of photos. In addition, to capture the significances of different photos, we exploit the self-attention mechanism to obtain the visual representations of users and tourist attractions. We conducted experiments on a dataset crawled from Flickr, and the experimental results proved the advantage of this method.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel low-complexity lidar gesture recognition system for mobile robot control robust to gesture variation. Our system uses a modular approach, consisting of a pose estimation module and a gesture classifier. Pose estimates are predicted from lidar scans using a Convolutional Neural Network trained using an existing stereo-based pose estimation system. Gesture classification is accomplished using a Long Short-Term Memory network and uses a sequence of estimated body poses as input to predict a gesture. Breaking down the pipeline into two modules reduces the dimensionality of the input, which could be lidar scans, stereo imagery, or any other modality from which body keypoints can be extracted, making our system lightweight and suitable for mobile robot control with limited computing power. The use of lidar contributes to the robustness of the system, allowing it to operate in most outdoor conditions, to be independent of lighting conditions, and for input to be detected 360 degrees around the robot. The lidar-based pose estimator and gesture classifier use data augmentation and automated labeling techniques, requiring a minimal amount of data collection and avoiding the need for manual labeling. We report experimental results for each module of our system and demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it in a real-world robot teleoperation setting.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel metric to evaluate the robustness of deep learning based semantic segmentation approaches for crop row detection under different field conditions encountered by a field robot. A dataset with ten main categories encountered under various field conditions was used for testing. The effect on these conditions on the angular accuracy of crop row detection was compared. A deep convolutional encoder decoder network is implemented to predict crop row masks using RGB input images. The predicted mask is then sent to a post processing algorithm to extract the crop rows. The deep learning model was found to be robust against shadows and growth stages of the crop while the performance was reduced under direct sunlight, increasing weed density, tramlines and discontinuities in crop rows when evaluated with the novel metric.

**Abstract:** American football is an increasingly popular sport, with a growing audience in many countries in the world. The most watched American football league in the world is the United States' National Football League (NFL), where every offensive play can be either a run or a pass, and in this work we focus on passes. Many factors can affect the probability of pass completion, such as receiver separation from the nearest defender, distance from receiver to passer, offense formation, among many others. When predicting the completion probability of a pass, it is essential to know who the target of the pass is. By using distance measures between players and the ball, it is possible to calculate empirical probabilities and predict very accurately who the target will be. The big question is: how likely is it for a pass to be completed in an NFL match while the ball is in the air? We developed a machine learning algorithm to answer this based on several predictors. Using data from the 2018 NFL season, we obtained conditional and marginal predictions for pass completion probability based on a random forest model. This is based on a two-stage procedure: first, we calculate the probability of each offensive player being the pass target, then, conditional on the target, we predict completion probability based on the random forest model. Finally, the general completion probability can be calculated using the law of total probability. We present animations for selected plays and show the pass completion probability evolution.

**Abstract:** Cine cardiac MRI is routinely acquired for the assessment of cardiac health, but the imaging process is slow and typically requires several breath-holds to acquire sufficient k-space profiles to ensure good image quality. Several undersampling-based reconstruction techniques have been proposed during the last decades to speed up cine cardiac MRI acquisition. However, the undersampling factor is commonly fixed to conservative values before acquisition to ensure diagnostic image quality, potentially leading to unnecessarily long scan times. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end quality-aware cine short-axis cardiac MRI framework that combines image acquisition and reconstruction with downstream tasks such as segmentation, volume curve analysis and estimation of cardiac functional parameters. The goal is to reduce scan time by acquiring only a fraction of k-space data to enable the reconstruction of images that can pass quality control checks and produce reliable estimates of cardiac functional parameters. The framework consists of a deep learning model for the reconstruction of 2D+t cardiac cine MRI images from undersampled data, an image quality-control step to detect good quality reconstructions, followed by a deep learning model for bi-ventricular segmentation, a quality-control step to detect good quality segmentations and automated calculation of cardiac functional parameters. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we perform simulations using a cohort of selected participants from the UK Biobank (n=270), 200 healthy subjects and 70 patients with cardiomyopathies. Our results show that we can produce quality-controlled images in a scan time reduced from 12 to 4 seconds per slice, enabling reliable estimates of cardiac functional parameters such as ejection fraction within 5% mean absolute error.

**Abstract:** Person re-identification (re-id) aims to retrieve images of same identities across different camera views. Resolution mismatch occurs due to varying distances between person of interest and cameras, this significantly degrades the performance of re-id in real world scenarios. Most of the existing approaches resolve the re-id task as low resolution problem in which a low resolution query image is searched in a high resolution images gallery. Several approaches apply image super resolution techniques to produce high resolution images but ignore the multiple resolutions of gallery images which is a better realistic scenario. In this paper, we introduce channel correlations to improve the learning of features from the degraded data. In addition, to overcome the problem of multiple resolutions we propose a Resolution based Feature Distillation (RFD) approach. Such an approach learns resolution invariant features by filtering the resolution related features from the final feature vectors that are used to compute the distance matrix. We tested the proposed approach on two synthetically created datasets and on one original multi resolution dataset with real degradation. Our approach improves the performance when multiple resolutions occur in the gallery and have comparable results in case of single resolution (low resolution re-id).

**Abstract:** Estimating the performance of a machine learning system is a longstanding challenge in artificial intelligence research. Today, this challenge is especially relevant given the emergence of systems which appear to increasingly outperform human beings. In some cases, this "superhuman" performance is readily demonstrated; for example by defeating legendary human players in traditional two player games. On the other hand, it can be challenging to evaluate classification models that potentially surpass human performance. Indeed, human annotations are often treated as a ground truth, which implicitly assumes the superiority of the human over any models trained on human annotations. In reality, human annotators can make mistakes and be subjective. Evaluating the performance with respect to a genuine oracle may be more objective and reliable, even when querying the oracle is expensive or impossible. In this paper, we first raise the challenge of evaluating the performance of both humans and models with respect to an oracle which is unobserved. We develop a theory for estimating the accuracy compared to the oracle, using only imperfect human annotations for reference. Our analysis provides a simple recipe for detecting and certifying superhuman performance in this setting, which we believe will assist in understanding the stage of current research on classification. We validate the convergence of the bounds and the assumptions of our theory on carefully designed toy experiments with known oracles. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our theory by meta-analyzing large-scale natural language processing tasks, for which an oracle does not exist, and show that under our assumptions a number of models from recent years are with high probability superhuman.

**Abstract:** Automated 3-D breast ultrasound (ABUS) is a newfound system for breast screening that has been proposed as a supplementary modality to mammography for breast cancer detection. While ABUS has better performance in dense breasts, reading ABUS images is exhausting and time-consuming. So, a computer-aided detection system is necessary for interpretation of these images. Mass segmentation plays a vital role in the computer-aided detection systems and it affects the overall performance. Mass segmentation is a challenging task because of the large variety in size, shape, and texture of masses. Moreover, an imbalanced dataset makes segmentation harder. A novel mass segmentation approach based on deep learning is introduced in this paper. The deep network that is used in this study for image segmentation is inspired by U-net, which has been used broadly for dense segmentation in recent years. The system's performance was determined using a dataset of 50 masses including 38 malign and 12 benign lesions. The proposed segmentation method attained a mean Dice of 0.82 which outperformed a two-stage supervised edge-based method with a mean Dice of 0.74 and an adaptive region growing method with a mean Dice of 0.65.

**Abstract:** In batch reinforcement learning, there can be poorly explored state-action pairs resulting in poorly learned, inaccurate models and poorly performing associated policies. Various regularization methods can mitigate the problem of learning overly-complex models in Markov decision processes (MDPs), however they operate in technically and intuitively distinct ways and lack a common form in which to compare them. This paper unifies three regularization methods in a common framework -- a weighted average transition matrix. Considering regularization methods in this common form illuminates how the MDP structure and the state-action pair distribution of the batch data set influence the relative performance of regularization methods. We confirm intuitions generated from the common framework by empirical evaluation across a range of MDPs and data collection policies.

**Abstract:** The growing number of applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world domains has led to the development of privacy-preserving techniques due to the inherently sensitive nature of data. Most existing works focus on differential privacy, in which information is revealed in the clear to an agent whose learned model should be robust against information leakage to malicious third parties. Motivated by use cases in which only encrypted data might be shared, such as information from sensitive sites, in this work we consider scenarios in which the inputs themselves are sensitive and cannot be revealed. We develop a simple extension to the MDP framework which provides for the encryption of states. We present a preliminary, experimental study of how a DQN agent trained on encrypted states performs in environments with discrete and continuous state spaces. Our results highlight that the agent is still capable of learning in small state spaces even in presence of non-deterministic encryption, but performance collapses in more complex environments.

**Abstract:** Text detection in natural scene images for content analysis is an interesting task. The research community has seen some great developments for English/Mandarin text detection. However, Urdu text extraction in natural scene images is a task not well addressed. In this work, firstly, a new dataset is introduced for Urdu text in natural scene images. The dataset comprises of 500 standalone images acquired from real scenes. Secondly, the channel enhanced Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) method is applied to extract Urdu text regions as candidates in an image. Two-stage filtering mechanism is applied to eliminate non-candidate regions. In the first stage, text and noise are classified based on their geometric properties. In the second stage, a support vector machine classifier is trained to discard non-text candidate regions. After this, text candidate regions are linked using centroid-based vertical and horizontal distances. Text lines are further analyzed by a different classifier based on HOG features to remove non-text regions. Extensive experimentation is performed on the locally developed dataset to evaluate the performance. The experimental results show good performance on test set images. The dataset will be made available for research use. To the best of our knowledge, the work is the first of its kind for the Urdu language and would provide a good dataset for free research use and serve as a baseline performance on the task of Urdu text extraction.

**Abstract:** Neural embedding-based machine learning models have shown promise for predicting novel links in knowledge graphs. Unfortunately, their practical utility is diminished by their lack of interpretability. Recently, the fully interpretable, rule-based algorithm AnyBURL yielded highly competitive results on many general-purpose link prediction benchmarks. However, current approaches for aggregating predictions made by multiple rules are affected by redundancies. We improve upon AnyBURL by introducing the SAFRAN rule application framework, which uses a novel aggregation approach called Non-redundant Noisy-OR that detects and clusters redundant rules prior to aggregation. SAFRAN yields new state-of-the-art results for fully interpretable link prediction on the established general-purpose benchmarks FB15K-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10. Furthermore, it exceeds the results of multiple established embedding-based algorithms on FB15K-237 and WN18RR and narrows the gap between rule-based and embedding-based algorithms on YAGO3-10.

**Abstract:** Recent studies demonstrated the vulnerability of control policies learned through deep reinforcement learning against adversarial attacks, raising concerns about the application of such models to risk-sensitive tasks such as autonomous driving. Threat models for these demonstrations are limited to (1) targeted attacks through real-time manipulation of the agent's observation, and (2) untargeted attacks through manipulation of the physical environment. The former assumes full access to the agent's states/observations at all times, while the latter has no control over attack outcomes. This paper investigates the feasibility of targeted attacks through visually learned patterns placed on physical object in the environment, a threat model that combines the practicality and effectiveness of the existing ones. Through analysis, we demonstrate that a pre-trained policy can be hijacked within a time window, e.g., performing an unintended self-parking, when an adversarial object is present. To enable the attack, we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of both the environment and the agent can be learned by the attacker. Lastly, we empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed attack on different driving scenarios, perform a location robustness test, and study the tradeoff between the attack strength and its effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms are powerful exploration algorithms that allow robots to discover large repertoires of diverse and high-performing skills. However, QD algorithms are sample inefficient and require millions of evaluations. In this paper, we propose Dynamics-Aware Quality-Diversity (DA-QD), a framework to improve the sample efficiency of QD algorithms through the use of dynamics models. We also show how DA-QD can then be used for continual acquisition of new skill repertoires. To do so, we incrementally train a deep dynamics model from experience obtained when performing skill discovery using QD. We can then perform QD exploration in imagination with an imagined skill repertoire. We evaluate our approach on three robotic experiments. First, our experiments show DA-QD is 20 times more sample efficient than existing QD approaches for skill discovery. Second, we demonstrate learning an entirely new skill repertoire in imagination to perform zero-shot learning. Finally, we show how DA-QD is useful and effective for solving a long horizon navigation task and for damage adaptation in the real world.

**Abstract:** Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in solving routing problems. However, there is still a substantial gap in solution quality between machine learning and operations research algorithms. Recently, another line of research has been introduced that fuses the strengths of machine learning and operational research algorithms. In particular, search perturbation operators have been used to improve the solution. Nevertheless, using the perturbation may not guarantee a quality solution. This paper presents "Learning to Guide Local Search" (L2GLS), a learning-based approach for routing problems that uses a penalty term and reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust search efforts. L2GLS combines local search (LS) operators' strengths with penalty terms to escape local optimals. Routing problems have many practical applications, often presetting larger instances that are still challenging for many existing algorithms introduced in the learning to optimise field. We show that L2GLS achieves the new state-of-the-art results on larger TSP and CVRP over other machine learning methods.

**Abstract:** Symbolic learning represents the most straightforward approach to interpretable modeling, but its applications have been hampered by a single structural design choice: the adoption of propositional logic as the underlying language. Recently, more-than-propositional symbolic learning methods have started to appear, in particular for time-dependent data. These methods exploit the expressive power of modal temporal logics in powerful learning algorithms, such as temporal decision trees, whose classification capabilities are comparable with the best non-symbolic ones, while producing models with explicit knowledge representation.
  With the intent of following the same approach in the case of spatial data, in this paper we: i) present a theory of spatial decision tree learning; ii) describe a prototypical implementation of a spatial decision tree learning algorithm based, and strictly extending, the classical C4.5 algorithm; and iii) perform a series of experiments in which we compare the predicting power of spatial decision trees with that of classical propositional decision trees in several versions, for a multi-class image classification problem, on publicly available datasets. Our results are encouraging, showing clear improvements in the performances from the propositional to the spatial models, which in turn show higher levels of interpretability.

**Abstract:** We tackle the problem of automatically designing concurrent data structure operations given a sequential data structure specification and knowledge about concurrent behavior.  Designing concurrent code is a non-trivial task even in simplest of cases.  Humans often design concurrent data structure operations by transforming sequential versions into their respective concurrent versions.  This requires an understanding of the data structure, its sequential behavior, thread interactions during concurrent execution and shared memory synchronization primitives. We mechanize this design process using automated commonsense reasoning.  We assume that the data structure description is provided as axioms alongside the sequential code of its algebraic operations. This information is used to automatically derive concurrent code for that data structure, such as dictionary operations for linked lists and binary search trees. Knowledge in our case is expressed using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and we employ deduction and abduction -- just as humans do -- in the reasoning involved. ASP allows for succinct modeling of first order theories of pointer data structures, run-time thread interactions and shared memory synchronization.  Our reasoner can systematically make the same judgments as a human reasoner, while constructing provably safe concurrent code. We present several reasoning challenges involved in transforming the sequential data structure into its equivalent concurrent version. All the reasoning tasks are encoded in ASP and our reasoner can make sound judgments to transform sequential code into concurrent code. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to use commonsense reasoning to automatically transform sequential programs into concurrent code. We also have developed a tool that we describe that relies on state-of-the-art ASP solvers and performs the reasoning tasks involved to generate concurrent code.

**Abstract:** The performance of deep neural networks can be highly sensitive to the choice of a variety of meta-parameters, such as optimizer parameters and model hyperparameters. Tuning these well, however, often requires extensive and costly experimentation. Bayesian optimization (BO) is a principled approach to solve such expensive hyperparameter tuning problems efficiently. Key to the performance of BO is specifying and refining a distribution over functions, which is used to reason about the optima of the underlying function being optimized. In this work, we consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allows us to specify a tighter distribution a priori. Specifically, we focus on the common but potentially costly task of tuning optimizer parameters for training neural networks. Building on the meta BO method from Wang et al. (2018), we develop practical improvements that (a) boost its performance by leveraging tuning results on multiple tasks without requiring observations for the same meta-parameter points across all tasks, and (b) retain its regret bound for a special case of our method. As a result, we provide a coherent BO solution for iterative optimization of continuous optimizer parameters. To verify our approach in realistic model training setups, we collected a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands of configurations of near-state-of-the-art models on popular image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset. Our results show that on average, our method is able to locate good hyperparameters at least 3 times more efficiently than the best competing methods.

To address this challenge, we propose and implement a loss function for regression uncertainty estimation based on the Bayesian Validation Metric (BVM) framework while using ensemble learning. A series of experiments on in-distribution data show that the proposed method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, experiments on out-of-distribution data show that the proposed method is robust to statistical change and exhibits superior predictive capability.

**Abstract:** High-dimensional policies, such as those represented by neural networks, cannot be reasonably interpreted by humans. This lack of interpretability reduces the trust users have in policy behavior, limiting their use to low-impact tasks such as video games. Unfortunately, many methods rely on neural network representations for effective learning. In this work, we propose a method to build predictable policy trees as surrogates for policies such as neural networks. The policy trees are easily human interpretable and provide quantitative predictions of future behavior. We demonstrate the performance of this approach on several simulated tasks.

**Abstract:** We report a workflow and the output of a natural language processing (NLP)-based procedure to mine the extant metal-organic framework (MOF) literature describing structurally characterized MOFs and their solvent removal and thermal stabilities. We obtain over 2,000 solvent removal stability measures from text mining and 3,000 thermal decomposition temperatures from thermogravimetric analysis data. We assess the validity of our NLP methods and the accuracy of our extracted data by comparing to a hand-labeled subset. Machine learning (ML, i.e. artificial neural network) models trained on this data using graph- and pore-geometry-based representations enable prediction of stability on new MOFs with quantified uncertainty. Our web interface, MOFSimplify, provides users access to our curated data and enables them to harness that data for predictions on new MOFs. MOFSimplify also encourages community feedback on existing data and on ML model predictions for community-based active learning for improved MOF stability models.

**Abstract:** Typically, Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) focuses on extracting triples, representing a subject, a relation, and the object of the relation. However, most of the existing techniques are based on a predefined set of relations in each domain which limits their applicability to newer domains where these relations may be unknown such as financial documents. This paper presents a zero-shot open information extraction technique that extracts the entities (value) and their descriptions (key) from a sentence, using off the shelf machine reading comprehension (MRC) Model. The input questions to this model are created using a novel noun phrase generation method. This method takes the context of the sentence into account and can create a wide variety of questions making our technique domain independent. Given the questions and the sentence, our technique uses the MRC model to extract entities (value). The noun phrase corresponding to the question, with the highest confidence, is taken as the description (key).
  This paper also introduces the EDGAR10-Q dataset which is based on publicly available financial documents from corporations listed in US securities and exchange commission (SEC). The dataset consists of paragraphs, tagged values (entities), and their keys (descriptions) and is one of the largest among entity extraction datasets. This dataset will be a valuable addition to the research community, especially in the financial domain. Finally, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed technique on the EDGAR10-Q and Ade corpus drug dosage datasets, where it obtained 86.84 % and 97% accuracy, respectively.

**Abstract:** Extracting spatial-temporal knowledge from data is useful in many applications. It is important that the obtained knowledge is human-interpretable and amenable to formal analysis. In this paper, we propose a method that trains neural networks to learn spatial-temporal properties in the form of weighted graph-based signal temporal logic (wGSTL) formulas. For learning wGSTL formulas, we introduce a flexible wGSTL formula structure in which the user's preference can be applied in the inferred wGSTL formulas. In the proposed framework, each neuron of the neural networks corresponds to a subformula in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We initially train a neural network to learn the wGSTL operators and then train a second neural network to learn the parameters in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We use a COVID-19 dataset and a rain prediction dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed framework with three baseline classification methods including K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and artificial neural networks. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed framework is comparable with the baseline classification methods.

**Abstract:** The widespread availability of cell phones has enabled non-profits to deliver critical health information to their beneficiaries in a timely manner. This paper describes our work to assist non-profits that employ automated messaging programs to deliver timely preventive care information to beneficiaries (new and expecting mothers) during pregnancy and after delivery. Unfortunately, a key challenge in such information delivery programs is that a significant fraction of beneficiaries drop out of the program. Yet, non-profits often have limited health-worker resources (time) to place crucial service calls for live interaction with beneficiaries to prevent such engagement drops. To assist non-profits in optimizing this limited resource, we developed a Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) system. One key technical contribution in this system is a novel clustering method of offline historical data to infer unknown RMAB parameters. Our second major contribution is evaluation of our RMAB system in collaboration with an NGO, via a real-world service quality improvement study. The study compared strategies for optimizing service calls to 23003 participants over a period of 7 weeks to reduce engagement drops. We show that the RMAB group provides statistically significant improvement over other comparison groups, reducing ~ 30% engagement drops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the utility of RMABs in real world public health settings. We are transitioning our RMAB system to the NGO for real-world use.

**Abstract:** Learning-based trajectory prediction models have encountered great success, with the promise of leveraging contextual information in addition to motion history. Yet, we find that state-of-the-art forecasting methods tend to overly rely on the agent's dynamics, failing to exploit the semantic cues provided at its input. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CAB, a motion forecasting model equipped with a training procedure designed to promote the use of semantic contextual information. We also introduce two novel metrics -- dispersion and convergence-to-range -- to measure the temporal consistency of successive forecasts, which we found missing in standard metrics. Our method is evaluated on the widely adopted nuScenes Prediction benchmark.

<p>

**Abstract:** We introduce WildWood (WW), a new ensemble algorithm for supervised learning of Random Forest (RF) type. While standard RF algorithms use bootstrap out-of-bag samples to compute out-of-bag scores, WW uses these samples to produce improved predictions given by an aggregation of the predictions of all possible subtrees of each fully grown tree in the forest. This is achieved by aggregation with exponential weights computed over out-of-bag samples, that are computed exactly and very efficiently thanks to an algorithm called context tree weighting. This improvement, combined with a histogram strategy to accelerate split finding, makes WW fast and competitive compared with other well-established ensemble methods, such as standard RF and extreme gradient boosting algorithms.

**Abstract:** Contrastive explanations for understanding the behavior of black box models has gained a lot of attention recently as they provide potential for recourse. In this paper, we propose a method Contrastive Attributed explanations for Text (CAT) which provides contrastive explanations for natural language text data with a novel twist as we build and exploit attribute classifiers leading to more semantically meaningful explanations. To ensure that our contrastive generated text has the fewest possible edits with respect to the original text, while also being fluent and close to a human generated contrastive, we resort to a minimal perturbation approach regularized using a BERT language model and attribute classifiers trained on available attributes. We show through qualitative examples and a user study that our method not only conveys more insight because of these attributes, but also leads to better quality (contrastive) text. Moreover, quantitatively we show that our method is more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods with it also scoring higher on benchmark metrics such as flip rate, (normalized) Levenstein distance, fluency and content preservation.

**Abstract:** The open domain-dialogue system Alquist has a goal to conduct a coherent and engaging conversation that can be considered as one of the benchmarks of social intelligence. The fourth version of the system, developed within the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge 4, brings two main innovations. The first addresses coherence, and the second addresses the engagingness of the conversation. For innovations regarding coherence, we propose a novel hybrid approach combining hand-designed responses and a generative model. The proposed approach utilizes hand-designed dialogues, out-of-domain detection, and a neural response generator. Hand-designed dialogues walk the user through high-quality conversational flows. The out-of-domain detection recognizes that the user diverges from the predefined flow and prevents the system from producing a scripted response that might not make sense for unexpected user input. Finally, the neural response generator generates a response based on the context of the dialogue that correctly reacts to the unexpected user input and returns the dialogue to the boundaries of hand-designed dialogues. The innovations for engagement that we propose are mostly inspired by the famous exploration-exploitation dilemma. To conduct an engaging conversation with the dialogue partners, one has to learn their preferences and interests -- exploration. Moreover, to engage the partner, we have to utilize the knowledge we have already learned -- exploitation. In this work, we present the principles and inner workings of individual components of the open-domain dialogue system Alquist developed within the Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge 4 and the experiments we have conducted to evaluate them.

<p>

**Abstract:** We present a system for automatic converting of 2D mask object predictions and raw LiDAR point clouds into full 3D bounding boxes of objects. Because the LiDAR point clouds are partial, directly fitting bounding boxes to the point clouds is meaningless. Instead, we suggest that obtaining good results requires sharing information between \emph{all} objects in the dataset jointly, over multiple frames. We then make three improvements to the baseline. First, we address ambiguities in predicting the object rotations via direct optimization in this space while still backpropagating rotation prediction through the model. Second, we explicitly model outliers and task the network with learning their typical patterns, thus better discounting them. Third, we enforce temporal consistency when video data is available. With these contributions, our method significantly outperforms previous work despite the fact that those methods use significantly more complex pipelines, 3D models and additional human-annotated external sources of prior information.

**Abstract:** Domain alignment is currently the most prevalent solution to unsupervised domain-adaptation tasks and are often being presented as minimizers of some theoretical upper-bounds on risk in the target domain. However, further works revealed severe inadequacies between theory and practice: we consolidate this analysis and confirm that imposing domain invariance on features is neither necessary nor sufficient to obtain low target risk. We instead argue that successful deep domain adaptation rely largely on hidden inductive biases found in the common practice, such as model pre-training or design of encoder architecture. We perform various ablation experiments on popular benchmarks and our own synthetic transfers to illustrate their role in prototypical situations. To conclude our analysis, we propose to meta-learn parametric inductive biases to solve specific transfers and show their superior performance over handcrafted heuristics.

**Abstract:** When explaining the decisions of deep neural networks, simple stories are tempting but dangerous. Especially in computer vision, the most popular explanation approaches give a false sense of comprehension to its users and provide an overly simplistic picture. We introduce an interactive framework to understand the highly complex decision boundaries of modern vision models. It allows the user to exhaustively inspect, probe, and test a network's decisions. Across a range of case studies, we compare the power of our interactive approach to static explanation methods, showing how these can lead a user astray, with potentially severe consequences.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of learning the behavioral preferences of an expert engaged in a task from noisy and partially-observable demonstrations. This is motivated by real-world applications such as a line robot learning from observing a human worker, where some observations are occluded by environmental objects that cannot be removed. Furthermore, robotic perception tends to be imperfect and noisy. Previous techniques for inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) take the approach of either omitting the missing portions or inferring it as part of expectation-maximization, which tends to be slow and prone to local optima. We present a new method that generalizes the well-known Bayesian maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) IRL method by marginalizing the occluded portions of the trajectory. This is additionally extended with an observation model to account for perception noise. We show that the marginal MAP (MMAP) approach significantly improves on the previous IRL technique under occlusion in both formative evaluations on a toy problem and in a summative evaluation on an onion sorting line task by a robot.

**Abstract:** How can a robot navigate successfully in a rich and diverse environment, indoors or outdoors, along an office corridor or a trail in the park, on the flat ground, the staircase, or the elevator, etc.? To this end, this work aims at three challenges: (i) complex visual observations, (ii) partial observability of local sensing, and (iii) multimodal navigation behaviors that depend on both the local environment and the high-level goal. We propose a novel neural network (NN) architecture to represent a local controller and leverage the flexibility of the end-to-end approach to learn a powerful policy. To tackle complex visual observations, we extract multiscale spatial information through convolution layers. To deal with partial observability, we encode rich history information in LSTM-like modules. Importantly, we integrate the two into a single unified architecture that exploits convolutional memory cells to track the observation history at multiple spatial scales, which can capture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies between observations and controls. We additionally condition the network on the high-level goal in order to generate different navigation behavior modes. Specifically, we propose to use independent memory cells for different modes to prevent mode collapse in the learned policy. We implemented the NN controller on the SPOT robot and evaluate it on three challenging tasks with partial observations: adversarial pedestrian avoidance, blind-spot obstacle avoidance, and elevator riding. Our model significantly outperforms CNNs, conventional LSTMs, or the ablated versions of our model. A demo video will be publicly available, showing our SPOT robot traversing many different locations on our university campus.

**Abstract:** Predicting the evolution of the brain network, also called connectome, by foreseeing changes in the connectivity weights linking pairs of anatomical regions makes it possible to spot connectivity-related neurological disorders in earlier stages and detect the development of potential connectomic anomalies. Remarkably, such a challenging prediction problem remains least explored in the predictive connectomics literature. It is a known fact that machine learning (ML) methods have proven their predictive abilities in a wide variety of computer vision problems. However, ML techniques specifically tailored for the prediction of brain connectivity evolution trajectory from a single timepoint are almost absent. To fill this gap, we organized a Kaggle competition where 20 competing teams designed advanced machine learning pipelines for predicting the brain connectivity evolution from a single timepoint. The competing teams developed their ML pipelines with a combination of data pre-processing, dimensionality reduction, and learning methods. Utilizing an inclusive evaluation approach, we ranked the methods based on two complementary evaluation metrics (mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)) and their performances using different training and testing data perturbation strategies (single random split and cross-validation). The final rank was calculated using the rank product for each competing team across all evaluation measures and validation strategies. In support of open science, the developed 20 ML pipelines along with the connectomic dataset are made available on GitHub. The outcomes of this competition are anticipated to lead to the further development of predictive models that can foresee the evolution of brain connectivity over time, as well as other types of networks (e.g., genetic networks).

**Abstract:** Transport mode detection is a classification problem aiming to design an algorithm that can infer the transport mode of a user given multimodal signals (GPS and/or inertial sensors). It has many applications, such as carbon footprint tracking, mobility behaviour analysis, or real-time door-to-door smart planning. Most current approaches rely on a classification step using Machine Learning techniques, and, like in many other classification problems, deep learning approaches usually achieve better results than traditional machine learning ones using handcrafted features. Deep models, however, have a notable downside: they are usually heavy, both in terms of memory space and processing cost. We show that a small, optimized model can perform as well as a current deep model. During our experiments on the GeoLife and SHL 2018 datasets, we obtain models with tens of thousands of parameters, that is, 10 to 1,000 times less parameters and operations than networks from the state of the art, which still reach a comparable performance. We also show, using the aforementioned datasets, that the current preprocessing used to deal with signals of different lengths is suboptimal, and we provide better replacements. Finally, we introduce a way to use signals with different lengths with the lighter Convolutional neural networks, without using the heavier Recurrent Neural Networks.

**Abstract:** When humans conceive how to perform a particular task, they do so hierarchically: splitting higher-level tasks into smaller sub-tasks. However, in the literature on natural language (NL) command of situated agents, most works have treated the procedures to be executed as flat sequences of simple actions, or any hierarchies of procedures have been shallow at best. In this paper, we propose a formalism of procedures as programs, a powerful yet intuitive method of representing hierarchical procedural knowledge for agent command and control. We further propose a modeling paradigm of hierarchical modular networks, which consist of a planner and reactors that convert NL intents to predictions of executable programs and probe the environment for information necessary to complete the program execution. We instantiate this framework on the IQA and ALFRED datasets for NL instruction following. Our model outperforms reactive baselines by a large margin on both datasets. We also demonstrate that our framework is more data-efficient, and that it allows for fast iterative development.

**Abstract:** Research in machine learning (ML) has primarily argued that models trained on incomplete or biased datasets can lead to discriminatory outputs. In this commentary, we propose moving the research focus beyond bias-oriented framings by adopting a power-aware perspective to "study up" ML datasets. This means accounting for historical inequities, labor conditions, and epistemological standpoints inscribed in data. We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our community -- one bias-oriented, the other power-aware. This way, we highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation. In the first area, we argue that reducing societal problems to "bias" misses the context-based nature of data. In the second one, we highlight the corporate forces and market imperatives involved in the labor of data workers that subsequently shape ML datasets. Finally, we propose expanding current transparency-oriented efforts in dataset documentation to reflect the social contexts of data design and production.

**Abstract:** Temporal sentence grounding in videos(TSGV), which aims to localize one target segment from an untrimmed video with respect to a given sentence query, has drawn increasing attentions in the research community over the past few years. Different from the task of temporal action localization, TSGV is more flexible since it can locate complicated activities via natural languages, without restrictions from predefined action categories. Meanwhile, TSGV is more challenging since it requires both textual and visual understanding for semantic alignment between two modalities(i.e., text and video). In this survey, we give a comprehensive overview for TSGV, which i) summarizes the taxonomy of existing methods, ii) provides a detailed description of the evaluation protocols(i.e., datasets and metrics) to be used in TSGV, and iii) in-depth discusses potential problems of current benchmarking designs and research directions for further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic survey on temporal sentence grounding. More specifically, we first discuss existing TSGV approaches by grouping them into four categories, i.e., two-stage methods, end-to-end methods, reinforcement learning-based methods, and weakly supervised methods. Then we present the benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics to assess current research progress. Finally, we discuss some limitations in TSGV through pointing out potential problems improperly resolved in the current evaluation protocols, which may push forwards more cutting edge research in TSGV. Besides, we also share our insights on several promising directions, including three typical tasks with new and practical settings based on TSGV.

**Abstract:** Proteins perform critical processes in all living systems: converting solar energy into chemical energy, replicating DNA, as the basis of highly performant materials, sensing and much more. While an incredible range of functionality has been sampled in nature, it accounts for a tiny fraction of the possible protein universe. If we could tap into this pool of unexplored protein structures, we could search for novel proteins with useful properties that we could apply to tackle the environmental and medical challenges facing humanity. This is the purpose of protein design.
  Sequence design is an important aspect of protein design, and many successful methods to do this have been developed. Recently, deep-learning methods that frame it as a classification problem have emerged as a powerful approach. Beyond their reported improvement in performance, their primary advantage over physics-based methods is that the computational burden is shifted from the user to the developers, thereby increasing accessibility to the design method. Despite this trend, the tools for assessment and comparison of such models remain quite generic. The goal of this paper is to both address the timely problem of evaluation and to shine a spotlight, within the Machine Learning community, on specific assessment criteria that will accelerate impact.
  We present a carefully curated benchmark set of proteins and propose a number of standard tests to assess the performance of deep learning based methods. Our robust benchmark provides biological insight into the behaviour of design methods, which is essential for evaluating their performance and utility. We compare five existing models with two novel models for sequence prediction. Finally, we test the designs produced by these models with AlphaFold2, a state-of-the-art structure-prediction algorithm, to determine if they are likely to fold into the intended 3D shapes.

**Abstract:** We study the optimization version of the equal cardinality set partition problem (where the absolute difference between the equal sized partitions' sums are minimized). While this problem is NP-hard and requires exponential complexity to solve in general, we have formulated a weaker version of this NP-hard problem, where the goal is to find a locally optimal solution. The local optimality considered in our work is under any swap between the opposing partitions' element pairs. To this end, we designed an algorithm which can produce such a locally optimal solution in $O(N^2)$ time and $O(N)$ space. Our approach does not require positive or integer inputs and works equally well under arbitrary input precisions. Thus, it is widely applicable in different problem scenarios.

  Local keypoint descriptors such as SIFT are used to represent the images, and based on those descriptors matching, images are matched and retrieved. Features are quantized so that searching/matching may be made feasible for large databases at the cost of accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose binary feature that is obtained by quantizing the SIFT into binary, and rank list is re-examined to remove the false positives. Experiments on challenging dataset shows the gain in accuracy and time.

**Abstract:** Automatic transcription of scene understanding in images and videos is a step towards artificial general intelligence. Image captioning is a nomenclature for describing meaningful information in an image using computer vision techniques. Automated image captioning techniques utilize encoder and decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts features from an image and the decoder generates a transcript. In this work, we investigate two unexplored ideas for image captioning using transformers: First, we demonstrate the enforcement of using objects' relevance in the surrounding environment. Second, learning an explicit association between labels and language constructs. We propose label-attention Transformer with geometrically coherent objects (LATGeO). The proposed technique acquires a proposal of geometrically coherent objects using a deep neural network (DNN) and generates captions by investigating their relationships using a label-attention module. Object coherence is defined using the localized ratio of the geometrical properties of the proposals. The label-attention module associates the extracted objects classes to the available dictionary using self-attention layers. The experimentation results show that objects' relevance in surroundings and binding of their visual feature with their geometrically localized ratios combined with its associated labels help in defining meaningful captions. The proposed framework is tested on the MSCOCO dataset, and a thorough evaluation resulting in overall better quantitative scores pronounces its superiority.

**Abstract:** Upcoming beyond fifth generation (5G) communications systems aim at further enhancing key performance indicators and fully supporting brand new use cases by embracing emerging techniques, e.g., reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrated communication, localization, and sensing, and mmWave/THz communications. The wireless intelligence empowered by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques has been widely considered at the transceivers, and now the paradigm is deemed to be shifted to the smart control of radio propagation environment by virtue of RISs. In this article, we argue that to harness the full potential of RISs, localization and communication must be tightly coupled. This is in sharp contrast to 5G and earlier generations, where localization was a minor additional service. To support this, we first introduce the fundamentals of RIS mmWave channel modeling, followed by RIS channel state information acquisition and link establishment. Then, we deal with the connection between localization and communications, from a separate and joint perspective.

**Abstract:** In this paper, I will discuss the work I am currently doing as a Ph.D. student at the University of Potsdam, under the tutoring of T. Schaub. I'm currently looking into action description in ASP. More precisely, my goal is to explore how to represent actions with durations in ASP, in different contexts. Right now, I'm focused on Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), looking at how to represent speeds for different agents and contexts.
  Before tackling duration, I wanted to explore and compare different representations of action taking in ASP. For this, I started comparing different simple encodings tackling the MAPF problem. Even in simple code, choices and assumptions have been made in their creations. The objective of my work is to present the consequences of those design decisions in terms of performance and knowledge representation. As far as I know, there is no current research on this topic.
  Besides that, I'm also exploring different ways to represent duration and to solve related problems. I planed to compare them the same way I described before. I also want this to help me find innovative and effective ways to solve problems with duration.

**Abstract:** Over the last few years, the concept of Artificial Intelligence has become central in different tasks concerning both our daily life and several working scenarios. Among these tasks automated planning has always been central in the AI research community. In particular, this manuscript is focused on a specialized kind of planning known as Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP). Epistemic Planning (EP) refers to an automated planning setting where the agent reasons in the space of knowledge/beliefs states and tries to find a plan to reach a desirable state from a starting one. Its general form, the MEP problem, involves multiple agents who need to reason about both the state of the world and the information flows between agents. To tackle the MEP problem several tools have been developed and, while the diversity of approaches has led to a deeper understanding of the problem space, each proposed tool lacks some abilities and does not allow for a comprehensive investigation of the information flows. That is why, the objective of our work is to formalize an environment where a complete characterization of the agents' knowledge/beliefs interaction and update is possible. In particular, we aim to achieve such goal by defining a new action-based language for multi-agent epistemic planning and to implement an epistemic planner based on it. This solver should provide a tool flexible enough to reason on different domains, e.g., economy, security, justice and politics, where considering others' knowledge/beliefs could lead to winning strategies.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of finding relevant consistent concepts in a conversational AI system, particularly, for realizing a conversational socialbot. Commonsense knowledge about various topics can be represented as an answer set program. However, to advance the conversation, we need to solve the problem of finding relevant consistent concepts, i.e., find consistent knowledge in the "neighborhood" of the current topic being discussed that can be used to advance the conversation. Traditional ASP solvers will generate the whole answer set which is stripped of all the associations between the various atoms (concepts) and thus cannot be used to find relevant consistent concepts. Similarly, goal-directed implementations of ASP will only find concepts directly relevant to a query. We present the DiscASP system that will find the partial consistent model that is relevant to a given topic in a manner similar to how a human will find it. DiscASP is based on a novel graph-based algorithm for finding stable models of an answer set program. We present the DiscASP algorithm, its implementation, and its application to developing a conversational socialbot.

**Abstract:** SHACL is a W3C-proposed language for expressing structural constraints on RDF graphs. The recommendation only specifies semantics for non-recursive SHACL; recently, some efforts  have been made to allow recursive SHACL schemas.  In this paper, we argue that for defining and studying semantics of recursive SHACL, lessons can be learned from years of research in non-monotonic reasoning.  We show that from a SHACL schema, a three-valued semantic operator can directly be obtained. Building on Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT), this operator immediately induces a wide variety of semantics, including a supported, stable, and well-founded semantics, related in the expected ways.  By building on AFT, a rich body of theoretical results becomes directly available for SHACL.  As such, the main contribution of this short paper is providing theoretical foundations for the study of recursive SHACL, which can later enable an informed decision for an extension of the W3C recommendation.

**Abstract:** We use Gaussian stochastic weight averaging (SWAG) to assess the model-form uncertainty associated with neural-network-based function approximation relevant to fluid flows. SWAG approximates a posterior Gaussian distribution of each weight, given training data, and a constant learning rate. Having access to this distribution, it is able to create multiple models with various combinations of sampled weights, which can be used to obtain ensemble predictions. The average of such an ensemble can be regarded as the `mean estimation', whereas its standard deviation can be used to construct `confidence intervals', which enable us to perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) with regard to the training process of neural networks. We utilize representative neural-network-based function approximation tasks for the following cases: (i) a two-dimensional circular-cylinder wake; (ii) the DayMET dataset (maximum daily temperature in North America); (iii) a three-dimensional square-cylinder wake; and (iv) urban flow, to assess the generalizability of the present idea for a wide range of complex datasets. SWAG-based UQ can be applied regardless of the network architecture, and therefore, we demonstrate the applicability of the method for two types of neural networks: (i) global field reconstruction from sparse sensors by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP); and (ii) far-field state estimation from sectional data with two-dimensional CNN. We find that SWAG can obtain physically-interpretable confidence-interval estimates from the perspective of model-form uncertainty. This capability supports its use for a wide range of problems in science and engineering.

**Abstract:** In this work, we explore a new Spiking Neural Network (SNN) formulation with Resonate-and-Fire (RAF) neurons (Izhikevich, 2001) trained with gradient descent via back-propagation. The RAF-SNN, while more biologically plausible, achieves performance comparable to or higher than conventional models in the Machine Learning literature across different network configurations, using similar or fewer parameters. Strikingly, the RAF-SNN proves robust against noise induced at testing/training time, under both static and dynamic conditions. Against CNN on MNIST, we show 25% higher absolute accuracy with N(0, 0.2) induced noise at testing time. Against LSTM on N-MNIST, we show 70% higher absolute accuracy with 20% induced noise at training time.

**Abstract:** We consider adversarial machine learning based attacks on power allocation where the base station (BS) allocates its transmit power to multiple orthogonal subcarriers by using a deep neural network (DNN) to serve multiple user equipments (UEs). The DNN that corresponds to a regression model is trained with channel gains as the input and returns transmit powers as the output. While the BS allocates the transmit powers to the UEs to maximize rates for all UEs, there is an adversary that aims to minimize these rates. The adversary may be an external transmitter that aims to manipulate the inputs to the DNN by interfering with the pilot signals that are transmitted to measure the channel gain. Alternatively, the adversary may be a rogue UE that transmits fabricated channel estimates to the BS. In both cases, the adversary carefully crafts adversarial perturbations to manipulate the inputs to the DNN of the BS subject to an upper bound on the strengths of these perturbations. We consider the attacks targeted on a single UE or all UEs. We compare these attacks with a benchmark, where the adversary scales down the input to the DNN. We show that the adversarial attacks are much more effective than the benchmark attack in terms of reducing the rate of communications. We also show that adversarial attacks are robust to the uncertainty at the adversary including the erroneous knowledge of channel gains and the potential errors in exercising the attacks exactly as specified.

**Abstract:** Holographic displays can generate light fields by dynamically modulating the wavefront of a coherent beam of light using a spatial light modulator, promising rich virtual and augmented reality applications. However, the limited spatial resolution of existing dynamic spatial light modulators imposes a tight bound on the diffraction angle. As a result, today's holographic displays possess low √©tendue, which is the product of the display area and the maximum solid angle of diffracted light. The low √©tendue forces a sacrifice of either the field of view (FOV) or the display size. In this work, we lift this limitation by presenting neural √©tendue expanders. This new breed of optical elements, which is learned from a natural image dataset, enables higher diffraction angles for ultra-wide FOV while maintaining both a compact form factor and the fidelity of displayed contents to human viewers. With neural √©tendue expanders, we achieve 64$\times$ √©tendue expansion of natural images with reconstruction quality (measured in PSNR) over 29dB on simulated retinal-resolution images. As a result, the proposed approach with expansion factor 64$\times$ enables high-fidelity ultra-wide-angle holographic projection of natural images using an 8K-pixel SLM, resulting in a 18.5 mm eyebox size and 2.18 steradians FOV, covering 85\% of the human stereo FOV.

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) can potentially support histopathologists in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of cancer types. In colorectal cancer (CRC), AI can alleviate the laborious task of characterization and reporting on resected biopsies, including polyps, the numbers of which are increasing as a result of CRC population screening programs, ongoing in many countries all around the globe. Here, we present an approach to address two major challenges in automated assessment of CRC histopathology whole-slide images. First, we present an AI-based method to segment multiple tissue compartments in the H\&E-stained whole-slide image, which provides a different, more perceptible picture of tissue morphology and composition. We test and compare a panel of state-of-the-art loss functions available for segmentation models, and provide indications about their use in histopathology image segmentation, based on the analysis of a) a multi-centric cohort of CRC cases from five medical centers in the Netherlands and Germany, and b) two publicly available datasets on segmentation in CRC. Second, we use the best performing AI model as the basis for a computer-aided diagnosis system (CAD) that classifies colon biopsies into four main categories that are relevant pathologically. We report the performance of this system on an independent cohort of more than 1,000 patients. The results show the potential of such an AI-based system to assist pathologists in diagnosis of CRC in the context of population screening. We have made the segmentation model available for research use on https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/colon-tissue-segmentation/.

**Abstract:** This paper considers the problem of modeling and estimating community memberships of nodes in a directed network where every row (column) node is associated with a vector determining its membership in each row (column) community. To model such directed network, we propose directed degree corrected mixed membership (DiDCMM) model by considering degree heterogeneity. DiDCMM is identifiable under popular conditions for mixed membership network when considering degree heterogeneity. Based on the cone structure inherent in the normalized version of the left singular vectors and the simplex structure inherent in the right singular vectors of the population adjacency matrix, we build an efficient algorithm called DiMSC to infer the community membership vectors for both row nodes and column nodes. By taking the advantage of DiMSC's equivalence algorithm which returns same estimations as DiMSC and the recent development on row-wise singular vector deviation, we show that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically consistent under mild conditions by providing error bounds for the inferred membership vectors of each row node and each column node under DiDCMM. The theory is supplemented by a simulation study.

**Abstract:** Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is based on capturing the multi-bounce indirect reflections from the hidden objects. Active NLOS imaging systems rely on the capture of the time of flight of light through the scene, and have shown great promise for the accurate and robust reconstruction of hidden scenes without the need for specialized scene setups and prior assumptions. Despite that existing methods can reconstruct 3D geometries of the hidden scene with excellent depth resolution, accurately recovering object textures and appearance with high lateral resolution remains an challenging problem. In this work, we propose a new problem formulation, called NLOS photography, to specifically address this deficiency. Rather than performing an intermediate estimate of the 3D scene geometry, our method follows a data-driven approach and directly reconstructs 2D images of a NLOS scene that closely resemble the pictures taken with a conventional camera from the location of the relay wall. This formulation largely simplifies the challenging reconstruction problem by bypassing the explicit modeling of 3D geometry, and enables the learning of a deep model with a relatively small training dataset. The results are NLOS reconstructions of unprecedented lateral resolution and image quality.

**Abstract:** Cloud networks are difficult to monitor because they grow rapidly and the budgets for monitoring them are limited. We propose a framework for estimating network metrics, such as latency and packet loss, with guarantees on estimation errors for a fixed monitoring budget. Our proposed algorithms produce a distribution of probes across network paths, which we then monitor; and are based on A- and E-optimal experimental designs in statistics. Unfortunately, these designs are too computationally costly to use at production scale. We propose their scalable and near-optimal approximations based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. We validate our approaches in simulation on real network topologies, and also using a production probing system in a real cloud network. We show major gains in reducing the probing budget compared to both production and academic baselines, while maintaining low estimation errors, even with very low probing budgets.

**Abstract:** We present the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset. HM3D is a large-scale dataset of 1,000 building-scale 3D reconstructions from a diverse set of real-world locations. Each scene in the dataset consists of a textured 3D mesh reconstruction of interiors such as multi-floor residences, stores, and other private indoor spaces.
  HM3D surpasses existing datasets available for academic research in terms of physical scale, completeness of the reconstruction, and visual fidelity. HM3D contains 112.5k m^2 of navigable space, which is 1.4 - 3.7x larger than other building-scale datasets such as MP3D and Gibson. When compared to existing photorealistic 3D datasets such as Replica, MP3D, Gibson, and ScanNet, images rendered from HM3D have 20 - 85% higher visual fidelity w.r.t. counterpart images captured with real cameras, and HM3D meshes have 34 - 91% fewer artifacts due to incomplete surface reconstruction.
  The increased scale, fidelity, and diversity of HM3D directly impacts the performance of embodied AI agents trained using it. In fact, we find that HM3D is `pareto optimal' in the following sense -- agents trained to perform PointGoal navigation on HM3D achieve the highest performance regardless of whether they are evaluated on HM3D, Gibson, or MP3D. No similar claim can be made about training on other datasets. HM3D-trained PointNav agents achieve 100% performance on Gibson-test dataset, suggesting that it might be time to retire that episode dataset.

**Abstract:** We consider the "policy choice" problem -- otherwise known as best arm identification in the bandit literature -- proposed by Kasy and Sautmann (2021) for adaptive experimental design. Theorem 1 of Kasy and Sautmann (2021) provides three asymptotic results that give theoretical guarantees for exploration sampling developed for this setting. We first show that the proof of Theorem 1 (1) has technical issues, and the proof and statement of Theorem 1 (2) are incorrect. We then show, through a counterexample, that Theorem 1 (3) is false. For the former two, we correct the statements and provide rigorous proofs. For Theorem 1 (3), we propose an alternative objective function, which we call posterior weighted policy regret, and derive the asymptotic optimality of exploration sampling.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models are becoming increasingly popular in different types of settings. This is mainly caused by their ability to achieve a level of predictive performance that is hard to match by human experts in this new era of big data. With this usage growth comes an increase of the requirements for accountability and understanding of the models' predictions. However, the degree of sophistication of the most successful models (e.g. ensembles, deep learning) is becoming a large obstacle to this endeavour as these models are essentially black boxes. In this paper we describe two general approaches that can be used to provide interpretable descriptions of the expected performance of any black box classification model. These approaches are of high practical relevance as they provide means to uncover and describe in an interpretable way situations where the models are expected to have a performance that deviates significantly from their average behaviour. This may be of critical relevance for applications where costly decisions are driven by the predictions of the models, as it can be used to warn end users against the usage of the models in some specific cases.

**Abstract:** Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve excellent performance on many real-world tasks, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A leading defense against such attacks is adversarial training, a technique in which a DNN is trained to be robust to adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial noise to its input. This procedure is effective but must be done during the training phase. In this work, we propose Augmented Random Forest (ARF), a simple and easy-to-use strategy for robustifying an existing pretrained DNN without modifying its weights. For every image, we generate randomized test time augmentations by applying diverse color, blur, noise, and geometric transforms. Then we use the DNN's logits output to train a simple random forest to predict the real class label. Our method achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on a diversity of white and black box attacks with minimal compromise on the natural images' classification. We test ARF also against numerous adaptive white-box attacks and it shows excellent results when combined with adversarial training. Code is available at https://github.com/giladcohen/ARF.

**Abstract:** Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques have enabled their successful application across a spectrum of commercial and industrial settings. However, these techniques require large volumes of data to be aggregated in a centralized manner, forestalling their applicability to scenarios wherein the data is sensitive or the cost of data transmission is prohibitive. Federated Learning alleviates these problems by decentralizing model training, thereby removing the need for data transfer and aggregation. To advance the adoption of Federated Learning, more research and development needs to be conducted to address some important open questions. In this work, we propose OpenFed, an open-source software framework for end-to-end Federated Learning. OpenFed reduces the barrier to entry for both researchers and downstream users of Federated Learning by the targeted removal of existing pain points. For researchers, OpenFed provides a framework wherein new methods can be easily implemented and fairly evaluated against an extensive suite of benchmarks. For downstream users, OpenFed allows Federated Learning to be plug and play within different subject-matter contexts, removing the need for deep expertise in Federated Learning.
