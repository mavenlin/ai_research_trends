**Abstract:** Frozen models trained to mimic static datasets can never improve their performance. Models that can employ internet-retrieval for up-to-date information and obtain feedback from humans during deployment provide the promise of both adapting to new information, and improving their performance. In this work we study how to improve internet-driven conversational skills in such a learning framework. We collect deployment data, which we make publicly available, of human interactions, and collect various types of human feedback -- including binary quality measurements, free-form text feedback, and fine-grained reasons for failure. We then study various algorithms for improving from such feedback, including standard supervised learning, rejection sampling, model-guiding and reward-based learning, in order to make recommendations on which type of feedback and algorithms work best. We find the recently introduced Director model (Arora et al., '22) shows significant improvements over other existing approaches.

<p>

**Abstract:** Why do networks have negative weights at all? The answer is: to learn more functions. We mathematically prove that deep neural networks with all non-negative weights are not universal approximators. This fundamental result is assumed by much of the deep learning literature without previously proving the result and demonstrating its necessity.

**Abstract:** We present BlenderBot 3, a 175B parameter dialogue model capable of open-domain conversation with access to the internet and a long-term memory, and having been trained on a large number of user defined tasks. We release both the model weights and code, and have also deployed the model on a public web page to interact with organic users. This technical report describes how the model was built (architecture, model and training scheme), and details of its deployment, including safety mechanisms. Human evaluations show its superiority to existing open-domain dialogue agents, including its predecessors (Roller et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2022). Finally, we detail our plan for continual learning using the data collected from deployment, which will also be publicly released. The goal of this research program is thus to enable the community to study ever-improving responsible agents that learn through interaction.

**Abstract:** Diarization partitions an audio stream into segments based on the voices of the speakers. Real-time diarization systems that include an enrollment step should limit enrollment training samples to reduce user interaction time. Although training on a small number of samples yields poor performance, we show that the accuracy can be improved dramatically using a chronological self-training approach. We studied the tradeoff between training time and classification performance and found that 1 second is sufficient to reach over 95% accuracy. We evaluated on 700 audio conversation files of about 10 minutes each from 6 different languages and demonstrated average diarization error rates as low as 10%.

<p>

**Abstract:** We present a holistic approach to building a robust and useful natural language classification system for real-world content moderation. The success of such a system relies on a chain of carefully designed and executed steps, including the design of content taxonomies and labeling instructions, data quality control, an active learning pipeline to capture rare events, and a variety of methods to make the model robust and to avoid overfitting. Our moderation system is trained to detect a broad set of categories of undesired content, including sexual content, hateful content, violence, self-harm, and harassment. This approach generalizes to a wide range of different content taxonomies and can be used to create high-quality content classifiers that outperform off-the-shelf models.

**Abstract:** The promise of interaction between intelligent conversational agents and humans is that models can learn from such feedback in order to improve. Unfortunately, such exchanges in the wild will not always involve human utterances that are benign or of high quality, and will include a mixture of engaged (helpers) and unengaged or even malicious users (trolls). In this work we study how to perform robust learning in such an environment. We introduce a benchmark evaluation, SafetyMix, which can evaluate methods that learn safe vs. toxic language in a variety of adversarial settings to test their robustness. We propose and analyze several mitigating learning algorithms that identify trolls either at the example or at the user level. Our main finding is that user-based methods, that take into account that troll users will exhibit adversarial behavior across multiple examples, work best in a variety of settings on our benchmark. We then test these methods in a further real-life setting of conversations collected during deployment, with similar results.

**Abstract:** Data poisoning considers an adversary that distorts the training set of machine learning algorithms for malicious purposes. In this work, we bring to light one conjecture regarding the fundamentals of data poisoning, which we call the Lethal Dose Conjecture. The conjecture states: If $n$ clean training samples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-$N$ training set, only $Î˜(N/n)$ poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy. Theoretically, we verify this conjecture in multiple cases. We also offer a more general perspective of this conjecture through distribution discrimination. Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and its extension, Finite Aggregation (FA) are recent approaches for provable defenses against data poisoning, where they predict through the majority vote of many base models trained from different subsets of training set using a given learner. The conjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal -- if we have the most data-efficient learner, they can turn it into one of the most robust defenses against data poisoning. This outlines a practical approach to developing stronger defenses against poisoning via finding data-efficient learners. Empirically, as a proof of concept, we show that by simply using different data augmentations for base learners, we can respectively double and triple the certified robustness of DPA on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB without sacrificing accuracy.

<p>

**Abstract:** Named entity recognition (NER) task aims at identifying entities from a piece of text that belong to predefined semantic types such as person, location, organization, etc. The state-of-the-art solutions for flat entities NER commonly suffer from capturing the fine-grained semantic information in underlying texts. The existing span-based approaches overcome this limitation, but the computation time is still a concern. In this work, we propose a novel span-based NER framework, namely Global Pointer (GP), that leverages the relative positions through a multiplicative attention mechanism. The ultimate goal is to enable a global view that considers the beginning and the end positions to predict the entity. To this end, we design two modules to identify the head and the tail of a given entity to enable the inconsistency between the training and inference processes. Moreover, we introduce a novel classification loss function to address the imbalance label problem. In terms of parameters, we introduce a simple but effective approximate method to reduce the training parameters. We extensively evaluate GP on various benchmark datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that GP can outperform the existing solution. Moreover, the experimental results show the efficacy of the introduced loss function compared to softmax and entropy alternatives.

<p>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents must generalize beyond their training experience. Prior work has focused mostly on identical training and evaluation environments. Starting from the recently introduced Crafter benchmark, a 2D open world survival game, we introduce a new set of environments suitable for evaluating some agent's ability to generalize on previously unseen (numbers of) objects and to adapt quickly (meta-learning). In Crafter, the agents are evaluated by the number of unlocked achievements (such as collecting resources) when trained for 1M steps. We show that current agents struggle to generalize, and introduce novel object-centric agents that improve over strong baselines. We also provide critical insights of general interest for future work on Crafter through several experiments. We show that careful hyper-parameter tuning improves the PPO baseline agent by a large margin and that even feedforward agents can unlock almost all achievements by relying on the inventory display. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the original Crafter environment. Additionally, when trained beyond 1M steps, our tuned agents can unlock almost all achievements. We show that the recurrent PPO agents improve over feedforward ones, even with the inventory information removed. We introduce CrafterOOD, a set of 15 new environments that evaluate OOD generalization. On CrafterOOD, we show that the current agents fail to generalize, whereas our novel object-centric agents achieve state-of-the-art OOD generalization while also being interpretable. Our code is public.

**Abstract:** Photon-counting CT (PCCT) offers improved diagnostic performance through better spatial and energy resolution, but developing high-quality image reconstruction methods that can deal with these large datasets is challenging.
  Model-based solutions incorporate models of the physical acquisition in order to reconstruct more accurate images, but are dependent on an accurate forward operator and present difficulties with finding good regularization. Another approach is deep-learning reconstruction, which has shown great promise in CT. However, fully data-driven solutions typically need large amounts of training data and lack interpretability. To combine the benefits of both methods, while minimizing their respective drawbacks, it is desirable to develop reconstruction algorithms that combine both model-based and data-driven approaches. In this work, we present a novel deep-learning solution for material decomposition in PCCT, based on an unrolled/unfolded iterative network. We evaluate two cases: a learned post-processing, which implicitly utilizes model knowledge, and a learned gradient-descent, which has explicit model-based components in the architecture. With our proposed techniques, we solve a challenging PCCT simulation case: three-material decomposition in abdomen imaging with low dose, iodine contrast, and a very small training sample support. In this scenario, our approach outperforms a maximum likelihood estimation, a variational method, as well as a fully-learned network.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a weakly-supervised machine learning-based approach aiming at a tool to alert patients about possible respiratory diseases. Various types of pathologies may affect the respiratory system, potentially leading to severe diseases and, in certain cases, death. In general, effective prevention practices are considered as major actors towards the improvement of the patient's health condition. The proposed method strives to realize an easily accessible tool for the automatic diagnosis of respiratory diseases. Specifically, the method leverages Variational Autoencoder architectures permitting the usage of training pipelines of limited complexity and relatively small-sized datasets. Importantly, it offers an accuracy of 57 %, which is in line with the existing strongly-supervised approaches.

**Abstract:** Automatic segmentation of ground glass opacities and consolidations in chest computer tomography (CT) scans can potentially ease the burden of radiologists during times of high resource utilisation. However, deep learning models are not trusted in the clinical routine due to failing silently on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose a lightweight OOD detection method that leverages the Mahalanobis distance in the feature space and seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines. The simple approach can even augment pre-trained models with clinically relevant uncertainty quantification. We validate our method across four chest CT distribution shifts and two magnetic resonance imaging applications, namely segmentation of the hippocampus and the prostate. Our results show that the proposed method effectively detects far- and near-OOD samples across all explored scenarios.

**Abstract:** Visual question answering is an important task in both natural language and vision understanding. However, in most of the public visual question answering datasets such as VQA, CLEVR, the questions are human generated that specific to the given image, such as `What color are her eyes?'. The human generated crowdsourcing questions are relatively simple and sometimes have the bias toward certain entities or attributes. In this paper, we introduce a new question answering dataset based on image-ChiQA. It contains the real-world queries issued by internet users, combined with several related open-domain images. The system should determine whether the image could answer the question or not. Different from previous VQA datasets, the questions are real-world image-independent queries that are more various and unbiased. Compared with previous image-retrieval or image-caption datasets, the ChiQA not only measures the relatedness but also measures the answerability, which demands more fine-grained vision and language reasoning. ChiQA contains more than 40K questions and more than 200K question-images pairs. A three-level 2/1/0 label is assigned to each pair indicating perfect answer, partially answer and irrelevant. Data analysis shows ChiQA requires a deep understanding of both language and vision, including grounding, comparisons, and reading. We evaluate several state-of-the-art visual-language models such as ALBEF, demonstrating that there is still a large room for improvements on ChiQA.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven successful in a wide variety of applications such as speech recognition and synthesis, computer vision, machine translation, and game playing, to name but a few. However, existing deep neural network models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing the model performance, which is what we call reducing the complexity. In the following work, we try reducing the complexity of state of the art LSTM models for natural language tasks such as text classification, by distilling their knowledge to CNN based models, thus reducing the inference time(or latency) during testing.

**Abstract:** Modern vehicles, including autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles, have adopted an increasing variety of functionalities through connections and communications with other vehicles, smart devices, and infrastructures. However, the growing connectivity of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) also increases the vulnerabilities to network attacks. To protect IoV systems against cyber threats, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can identify malicious cyber-attacks have been developed using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. To accurately detect various types of attacks in IoV networks, we propose a novel ensemble IDS framework named Leader Class and Confidence Decision Ensemble (LCCDE). It is constructed by determining the best-performing ML model among three advanced ML algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) for every class or type of attack. The class leader models with their prediction confidence values are then utilized to make accurate decisions regarding the detection of various types of cyber-attacks. Experiments on two public IoV security datasets (Car-Hacking and CICIDS2017 datasets) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LCCDE for intrusion detection on both intra-vehicle and external networks.

**Abstract:** With the advent of the IoT, AI, and ML/DL algorithms, the data-driven medical application has emerged as a promising tool for designing reliable and scalable diagnostic and prognostic models from medical data. This has attracted a great deal of attention from academia to industry in recent years. This has undoubtedly improved the quality of healthcare delivery. However, these AI-based medical applications still have poor adoption due to their difficulties in satisfying strict security, privacy, and quality of service standards (such as low latency). Moreover, medical data are usually fragmented and private, making it challenging to generate robust results across populations. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it possible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner. Thus, FL has become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical data at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and security concerns. To this end, this survey paper highlights the current and future of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a significant burden. It also review and discuss the current research trends and their outcomes for designing reliable and scalable FL models. We outline the general FL's statistical problems, device challenges, security, privacy concerns, and its potential in the medical domain. Moreover, our study is also focused on medical applications where we highlight the burden of global cancer and the efficient use of FL for the development of computer-aided diagnosis tools for addressing them. We hope that this review serves as a checkpoint that sets forth the existing state-of-the-art works in a thorough manner and offers open problems and future research directions for this field.

**Abstract:** Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online algorithms. The goal is to match two sets of vertices to maximize the sum of the edge weights, where for one set of vertices, each vertex and its corresponding edge weights appear in a sequence. Currently, in the practical recommendation system or search engine, the weights are decided by the inner product between the deep representation of a user and the deep representation of an item. The standard online matching needs to pay $nd$ time to linear scan all the $n$ items, computing weight (assuming each representation vector has length $d$), and then decide the matching based on the weights. However, in reality, the $n$ could be very large, e.g. in online e-commerce platforms. Thus, improving the time of computing weights is a problem of practical significance. In this work, we provide the theoretical foundation for computing the weights approximately. We show that, with our proposed randomized data structures, the weights can be computed in sublinear time while still preserving the competitive ratio of the matching algorithm.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of actively learning a non-parametric choice model based on consumers' decisions. We present a negative result showing that such choice models may not be identifiable. To overcome the identifiability problem, we introduce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the choice model, which in a sense captures as much information about the choice model as could information-theoretically be identified. We then consider the problem of learning an approximation to this DAG representation in an active-learning setting. We design an efficient active-learning algorithm to estimate the DAG representation of the non-parametric choice model, which runs in polynomial time when the set of frequent rankings is drawn uniformly at random. Our algorithm learns the distribution over the most popular items of frequent preferences by actively and repeatedly offering assortments of items and observing the item chosen. We show that our algorithm can better recover a set of frequent preferences on both a synthetic and publicly available dataset on consumers' preferences, compared to the corresponding non-active learning estimation algorithms. This demonstrates the value of our algorithm and active-learning approaches more generally.

**Abstract:** Most continual learning methods are validated in settings where task boundaries are clearly defined and task identity information is available during training and testing. We explore how such methods perform in a task-agnostic setting that more closely resembles dynamic clinical environments with gradual population shifts. We propose ODEx, a holistic solution that combines out-of-distribution detection with continual learning techniques. Validation on two scenarios of hippocampus segmentation shows that our proposed method reliably maintains performance on earlier tasks without losing plasticity.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we provide an extension of confidence sequences for settings where the variance of the data-generating distribution does not exist or is infinite. Confidence sequences furnish confidence intervals that are valid at arbitrary data-dependent stopping times, naturally having a wide range of applications. We first establish a lower bound for the width of the Catoni-style confidence sequences for the finite variance case to highlight the looseness of the existing results. Next, we derive tight Catoni-style confidence sequences for data distributions having a relaxed bounded~$p^{th}-$moment, where~$p \in (1,2]$, and strengthen the results for the finite variance case of~$p =2$. The derived results are shown to better than confidence sequences obtained using Dubins-Savage inequality.

**Abstract:** Bloom filters are widely used data structures that compactly represent sets of elements. Querying a Bloom filter reveals if an element is not included in the underlying set or is included with a certain error rate. This membership testing can be modeled as a binary classification problem and solved through deep learning models, leading to what is called learned Bloom filters. We have identified that the benefits of learned Bloom filters are apparent only when considering a vast amount of data, and even then, there is a possibility to further reduce their memory consumption. For that reason, we introduce a lossless input compression technique that improves the memory consumption of the learned model while preserving a comparable model accuracy. We evaluate our approach and show significant memory consumption improvements over learned Bloom filters.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a medical AttentIon Denoising Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (AID-SRGAN) for diographic image super-resolution. First, we present a medical practical degradation model that considers various degradation factors beyond downsampling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first composite degradation model proposed for radiographic images. Furthermore, we propose AID-SRGAN, which can simultaneously denoise and generate high-resolution (HR) radiographs. In this model, we introduce an attention mechanism into the denoising module to make it more robust to complicated degradation. Finally, the SR module reconstructs the HR radiographs using the "clean" low-resolution (LR) radiographs. In addition, we propose a separate-joint training approach to train the model, and extensive experiments are conducted to show that the proposed method is superior to its counterparts. e.g., our proposed method achieves $31.90$ of PSNR with a scale factor of $4 \times$, which is $7.05 \%$ higher than that obtained by recent work, SPSR [16]. Our dataset and code will be made available at: https://github.com/yongsongH/AIDSRGAN-MICCAI2022.

**Abstract:** The real-time segmentation of drivable areas plays a vital role in accomplishing autonomous perception in cars. Recently there have been some rapid strides in the development of image segmentation models using deep learning. However, most of the advancements have been made in model architecture design. In solving any supervised deep learning problem related to segmentation, the success of the model that one builds depends upon the amount and quality of input training data we use for that model. This data should contain well-annotated varied images for better working of the segmentation model. Issues like this pertaining to annotations in a dataset can lead the model to conclude with overwhelming Type I and II errors in testing and validation, causing malicious issues when trying to tackle real world problems. To address this problem and to make our model more accurate, dynamic, and robust, data augmentation comes into usage as it helps in expanding our sample training data and making it better and more diversified overall. Hence, in our study, we focus on investigating the benefits of data augmentation by analyzing pre-existing image datasets and performing augmentations accordingly. Our results show that the performance and robustness of existing state of the art (or SOTA) models can be increased dramatically without any increase in model complexity or inference time. The augmentations decided on and used in this paper were decided only after thorough research of several other augmentation methodologies and strategies and their corresponding effects that are in widespread usage today. All our results are being reported on the widely used Cityscapes Dataset.

**Abstract:** Deep neural network (DNN) models, including those used in safety-critical domains, need to be thoroughly tested to ensure that they can reliably perform well in different scenarios. In this article, we provide an overview of structural coverage metrics for testing DNN models, including neuron coverage (NC), k-multisection neuron coverage (kMNC), top-k neuron coverage (TKNC), neuron boundary coverage (NBC), strong neuron activation coverage (SNAC) and modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC). We evaluate the metrics on realistic DNN models used for perception tasks (including LeNet-1, LeNet-4, LeNet-5, and ResNet20) as well as on networks used in autonomy (TaxiNet). We also provide a tool, DNNCov, which can measure the testing coverage for all these metrics. DNNCov outputs an informative coverage report to enable researchers and practitioners to assess the adequacy of DNN testing, compare different coverage measures, and to more conveniently inspect the model's internals during testing.

**Abstract:** We address the problem of retrieving images with both a sketch and a text query. We present TASK-former (Text And SKetch transformer), an end-to-end trainable model for image retrieval using a text description and a sketch as input. We argue that both input modalities complement each other in a manner that cannot be achieved easily by either one alone. TASK-former follows the late-fusion dual-encoder approach, similar to CLIP, which allows efficient and scalable retrieval since the retrieval set can be indexed independently of the queries. We empirically demonstrate that using an input sketch (even a poorly drawn one) in addition to text considerably increases retrieval recall compared to traditional text-based image retrieval. To evaluate our approach, we collect 5,000 hand-drawn sketches for images in the test set of the COCO dataset. The collected sketches are available a https://janesjanes.github.io/tsbir/.

**Abstract:** Isoforms are mRNAs produced from the same gene site in the phenomenon called Alternative Splicing. Studies have shown that more than 95% of human multi-exon genes have undergone alternative splicing. Although there are few changes in mRNA sequence, They may have a systematic effect on cell function and regulation. It is widely reported that isoforms of a gene have distinct or even contrasting functions. Most studies have shown that alternative splicing plays a significant role in human health and disease. Despite the wide range of gene function studies, there is little information about isoforms' functionalities. Recently, some computational methods based on Multiple Instance Learning have been proposed to predict isoform function using gene function and gene expression profile. However, their performance is not desirable due to the lack of labeled training data. In addition, probabilistic models such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) have been used to model the relation between isoforms. This project uses all the data and valuable information such as isoform sequences, expression profiles, and gene ontology graphs and proposes a comprehensive model based on Deep Neural Networks. The UniProt Gene Ontology (GO) database is used as a standard reference for gene functions. The NCBI RefSeq database is used for extracting gene and isoform sequences, and the NCBI SRA database is used for expression profile data. Metrics such as Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) and Precision-Recall Under the Curve (PR AUC) are used to measure the prediction accuracy.

**Abstract:** Approximate message passing (AMP) emerges as an effective iterative paradigm for solving high-dimensional statistical problems. However, prior AMP theory -- which focused mostly on high-dimensional asymptotics -- fell short of predicting the AMP dynamics when the number of iterations surpasses $o\big(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\big)$ (with $n$ the problem dimension). To address this inadequacy, this paper develops a non-asymptotic framework for understanding AMP in spiked matrix estimation. Built upon new decomposition of AMP updates and controllable residual terms, we lay out an analysis recipe to characterize the finite-sample behavior of AMP in the presence of an independent initialization, which is further generalized to allow for spectral initialization. As two concrete consequences of the proposed analysis recipe: (i) when solving $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, we predict the behavior of spectrally initialized AMP for up to $O\big(\frac{n}{\mathrm{poly}\log n}\big)$ iterations, showing that the algorithm succeeds without the need of a subsequent refinement stage (as conjectured recently by \citet{celentano2021local}); (ii) we characterize the non-asymptotic behavior of AMP in sparse PCA (in the spiked Wigner model) for a broad range of signal-to-noise ratio.

**Abstract:** Estimating uncertainty is at the core of performing scientific measurements in HEP: a measurement is not useful without an estimate of its uncertainty. The goal of uncertainty quantification (UQ) is inextricably linked to the question, "how do we physically and statistically interpret these uncertainties?" The answer to this question depends not only on the computational task we aim to undertake, but also on the methods we use for that task. For artificial intelligence (AI) applications in HEP, there are several areas where interpretable methods for UQ are essential, including inference, simulation, and control/decision-making. There exist some methods for each of these areas, but they have not yet been demonstrated to be as trustworthy as more traditional approaches currently employed in physics (e.g., non-AI frequentist and Bayesian methods).
  Shedding light on the questions above requires additional understanding of the interplay of AI systems and uncertainty quantification. We briefly discuss the existing methods in each area and relate them to tasks across HEP. We then discuss recommendations for avenues to pursue to develop the necessary techniques for reliable widespread usage of AI with UQ over the next decade.

**Abstract:** Neural Networks are known to be sensitive to initialisation. The explanation methods that rely on neural networks are not robust since they can have variations in their explanations when the model is initialized and trained with different random seeds. The sensitivity to model initialisation is not desirable in many safety critical applications such as disease diagnosis in healthcare, in which the explainability might have a significant impact in helping decision making. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on parameter averaging for robust explainability in tabular data setting, referred as XTab. We first initialize and train multiple instances of a shallow network (referred as local masks) with different random seeds for a downstream task. We then obtain a global mask model by "averaging the parameters" of local masks and show that the global model uses the majority rule to rank features based on their relative importance across all local models. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method can be used for feature selection as well as to obtain the global feature importance that are not sensitive to sub-optimal model initialisation.

**Abstract:** The volume contains selected contributions from the Machine Learning Challenge "Discover the Mysteries of the Maya", presented at the Discovery Challenge Track of The European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD 2021).
  Remote sensing has greatly accelerated traditional archaeological landscape surveys in the forested regions of the ancient Maya. Typical exploration and discovery attempts, beside focusing on whole ancient cities, focus also on individual buildings and structures. Recently, there have been several successful attempts of utilizing machine learning for identifying ancient Maya settlements. These attempts, while relevant, focus on narrow areas and rely on high-quality aerial laser scanning (ALS) data which covers only a fraction of the region where ancient Maya were once settled. Satellite image data, on the other hand, produced by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel missions, is abundant and, more importantly, publicly available. The "Discover the Mysteries of the Maya" challenge aimed at locating and identifying ancient Maya architectures (buildings, aguadas, and platforms) by performing integrated image segmentation of different types of satellite imagery (from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) data and ALS (lidar) data.

**Abstract:** One of the core challenges facing the medical image computing community is fast and efficient data sample labeling. Obtaining fine-grained labels for segmentation is particularly demanding since it is expensive, time-consuming, and requires sophisticated tools. On the contrary, applying bounding boxes is fast and takes significantly less time than fine-grained labeling, but does not produce detailed results. In response, we propose a novel framework for weakly-supervised tasks with the rapid and robust transformation of bounding boxes into segmentation masks without training any machine learning model, coined BoxShrink. The proposed framework comes in two variants - rapid-BoxShrink for fast label transformations, and robust-BoxShrink for more precise label transformations. An average of four percent improvement in IoU is found across several models when being trained using BoxShrink in a weakly-supervised setting, compared to using only bounding box annotations as inputs on a colonoscopy image data set. We open-sourced the code for the proposed framework and published it online.

**Abstract:** When evaluating quantities of interest that depend on the solutions to differential equations, we inevitably face the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Especially for parametrized, time dependent problems in engineering computations, it is often the case that acceptable computational budgets limit the availability of high-fidelity, accurate simulation data. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome this difficulty. Its key idea is to leverage many low-fidelity simulation data, less accurate but much faster to compute, to improve the approximations with limited high-fidelity data. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven framework of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling for parametrized, time-dependent problems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to enhance output predictions both for unseen parameter values and forward in time simultaneously - a task known to be particularly challenging for data-driven models. We demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed approaches in a variety of engineering problems with high- and low-fidelity data generated through fine versus coarse meshes, small versus large time steps, or finite element full-order versus deep learning reduced-order models. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-fidelity LSTM networks not only improve single-fidelity regression significantly, but also outperform the multi-fidelity models based on feed-forward neural networks.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks share with Logic Programming  several key relational inference mechanisms. The datasets on which they are trained and evaluated can be seen as database facts containing ground terms. This makes possible modeling their inference mechanisms with equivalent logic programs, to better understand not just how they propagate information between the entities involved in the machine learning process but also to infer limits on what can be learned from a given dataset and how well that might generalize to unseen test data. 
  This leads us to the key idea of this paper: modeling with the help of a logic program the information flows involved in learning to infer from the link structure of a graph and the information content of its nodes properties of new nodes, given their known connections to nodes with possibly similar properties. The problem is known as  graph node property prediction and our approach will consist in emulating with help of a Prolog program the key information propagation steps of a Graph Neural Network's training and inference stages.
  We test our a approach on the ogbn-arxiv node property inference benchmark. To infer class labels for nodes representing papers in a citation network, we distill the dependency trees of the text associated to each  node into directed acyclic  graphs that we encode as  ground Prolog terms.  Together with the set of their references to other papers, they become facts in a  database on which we reason with help of a Prolog program that mimics the information propagation in graph neural networks predicting  node properties. In the process, we invent  ground term similarity relations that help infer labels in the test set by propagating node properties from  similar nodes in the training set and we evaluate their effectiveness in comparison with that of the graph's link structure.  Finally, we implement explanation generators that unveil performance upper bounds inherent to the dataset.
  As a practical outcome, we  obtain a logic program, that, when seen as  machine learning algorithm, performs close to the state of the art on the node property prediction benchmark.

**Abstract:** The Model Reconciliation Problem (MRP) was introduced to address issues in explainable AI planning.  A solution to a MRP is an explanation for the differences between the models of the human and the planning agent (robot). Most approaches to solving MRPs assume that the robot, who needs to provide explanations, knows the human model. This assumption is not always realistic in several situations (e.g., the human might decide to update her model and the robot is unaware of the updates).
  In this paper, we propose a dialog-based approach for computing explanations of MRPs under the assumptions that (i) the robot does not know the human model;  (ii) the human and the robot share the set of predicates of the planning domain and their exchanges are about action descriptions and fluents' values;  (iii) communication between the parties is perfect; and (iv) the parties are truthful. A solution of a MRP is computed through a dialog, defined as a sequence of rounds of exchanges, between the robot and the human. In each round, the robot sends a potential  explanation, called proposal, to the human who replies with her evaluation of the proposal, called response. We develop algorithms for computing proposals by the robot and responses by the human and implement these algorithms in a system that combines imperative means with answer set programming using the multi-shot feature of clingo.

**Abstract:** The purpose of this paper is to compare different learnable frontends in medical acoustics tasks. A framework has been implemented to classify human respiratory sounds and heartbeats in two categories, i.e. healthy or affected by pathologies. After obtaining two suitable datasets, we proceeded to classify the sounds using two learnable state-of-art frontends -- LEAF and nnAudio -- plus a non-learnable baseline frontend, i.e. Mel-filterbanks. The computed features are then fed into two different CNN models, namely VGG16 and EfficientNet. The frontends are carefully benchmarked in terms of the number of parameters, computational resources, and effectiveness.
  This work demonstrates how the integration of learnable frontends in neural audio classification systems may improve performance, especially in the field of medical acoustics. However, the usage of such frameworks makes the needed amount of data even larger. Consequently, they are useful if the amount of data available for training is adequately large to assist the feature learning process.

**Abstract:** Expected risk minimization (ERM) is at the core of machine learning systems. This means that the risk inherent in a loss distribution is summarized using a single number - its average. In this paper, we propose a general approach to construct risk measures which exhibit a desired tail sensitivity and may replace the expectation operator in ERM. Our method relies on the specification of a reference distribution with a desired tail behaviour, which is in a one-to-one correspondence to a coherent upper probability. Any risk measure, which is compatible with this upper probability, displays a tail sensitivity which is finely tuned to the reference distribution. As a concrete example, we focus on divergence risk measures based on f-divergence ambiguity sets, which are a widespread tool used to foster distributional robustness of machine learning systems. For instance, we show how ambiguity sets based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence are intricately tied to the class of subexponential random variables. We elaborate the connection of divergence risk measures and rearrangement invariant Banach norms.

**Abstract:** Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) can solve complex cooperative tasks. However, the efficiency of existing MARL methods relies heavily on well-defined reward functions. Multiagent tasks with sparse reward feedback are especially challenging not only because of the credit distribution problem, but also due to the low probability of obtaining positive reward feedback. In this paper, we design a graph network called Cooperation Graph (CG). The Cooperation Graph is the combination of two simple bipartite graphs, namely, the Agent Clustering subgraph (ACG) and the Cluster Designating subgraph (CDG). Next, based on this novel graph structure, we propose a Cooperation Graph Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (CG-MARL) algorithm, which can efficiently deal with the sparse reward problem in multiagent tasks. In CG-MARL, agents are directly controlled by the Cooperation Graph. And a policy neural network is trained to manipulate this Cooperation Graph, guiding agents to achieve cooperation in an implicit way. This hierarchical feature of CG-MARL provides space for customized cluster-actions, an extensible interface for introducing fundamental cooperation knowledge. In experiments, CG-MARL shows state-of-the-art performance in sparse reward multiagent benchmarks, including the anti-invasion interception task and the multi-cargo delivery task.

**Abstract:** Incomplete multi-view clustering, which aims to solve the clustering problem on the incomplete multi-view data with partial view missing, has received more and more attention in recent years. Although numerous methods have been developed, most of the methods either cannot flexibly handle the incomplete multi-view data with arbitrary missing views or do not consider the negative factor of information imbalance among views. Moreover, some methods do not fully explore the local structure of all incomplete views. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a simple but effective method, named localized sparse incomplete multi-view clustering (LSIMVC). Different from the existing methods, LSIMVC intends to learn a sparse and structured consensus latent representation from the incomplete multi-view data by optimizing a sparse regularized and novel graph embedded multi-view matrix factorization model. Specifically, in such a novel model based on the matrix factorization, a l1 norm based sparse constraint is introduced to obtain the sparse low-dimensional individual representations and the sparse consensus representation. Moreover, a novel local graph embedding term is introduced to learn the structured consensus representation. Different from the existing works, our local graph embedding term aggregates the graph embedding task and consensus representation learning task into a concise term. Furthermore, to reduce the imbalance factor of incomplete multi-view learning, an adaptive weighted learning scheme is introduced to LSIMVC. Finally, an efficient optimization strategy is given to solve the optimization problem of our proposed model. Comprehensive experimental results performed on six incomplete multi-view databases verify that the performance of our LSIMVC is superior to the state-of-the-art IMC approaches. The code is available in https://github.com/justsmart/LSIMVC.

**Abstract:** For massive large-scale tasks, a multi-robot system (MRS) can effectively improve efficiency by utilizing each robot's different capabilities, mobility, and functionality. In this paper, we focus on the multi-robot coverage path planning (mCPP) problem in large-scale planar areas with random dynamic interferers in the environment, where the robots have limited resources. We introduce a worker-station MRS consisting of multiple workers with limited resources for actual work, and one station with enough resources for resource replenishment. We aim to solve the mCPP problem for the worker-station MRS by formulating it as a fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. Then we propose an end-to-end decentralized online planning method, which simultaneously solves coverage planning for workers and rendezvous planning for station. Our method manages to reduce the influence of random dynamic interferers on planning, while the robots can avoid collisions with them. We conduct simulation and real robot experiments, and the comparison results show that our method has competitive performance in solving the mCPP problem for worker-station MRS in metric of task finish time.

**Abstract:** Estimating the importance of variables is an essential task in modern machine learning. This help to evaluate the goodness of a feature in a given model. Several techniques for estimating the importance of variables have been developed during the last decade. In this paper, we proposed a computational and theoretical exploration of the emerging methods of variable importance estimation, namely: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Predictive Error Function (PERF), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) that were tested on different kinds of real-life and simulated data. All these methods can handle both regression and classification tasks seamlessly but all fail when it comes to dealing with data containing missing values. The implementation has shown that PERF has the best performance in the case of highly correlated data closely followed by RF. PERF and XGBOOST are "data-hungry" methods, they had the worst performance on small data sizes but they are the fastest when it comes to the execution time. SVM is the most appropriate when many redundant features are in the dataset. A surplus with the PERF is its natural cut-off at zero helping to separate positive and negative scores with all positive scores indicating essential and significant features while the negatives score indicates useless features. RF and LASSO are very versatile in a way that they can be used in almost all situations despite they are not giving the best results.

**Abstract:** In many low-to-middle income (LMIC) countries, ultrasound is used for assessment of pleural effusion. Typically, the extent of the effusion is manually measured by a sonographer, leading to significant intra-/inter-observer variability. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning (DL) to automate the process of pleural effusion segmentation from ultrasound images. On two datasets acquired in a LMIC setting, we achieve median Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.82 and 0.74 respectively using the nnU-net DL model. We also investigate the use of coordinate convolutions in the DL model and find that this results in a statistically significant improvement in the median DSC on the first dataset to 0.85, with no significant change on the second dataset. This work showcases, for the first time, the potential of DL in automating the process of effusion assessment from ultrasound in LMIC settings where there is often a lack of experienced radiologists to perform such tasks.

**Abstract:** Over the past few years, there has been a significant improvement in the domain of few-shot learning. This learning paradigm has shown promising results for the challenging problem of anomaly detection, where the general task is to deal with heavy class imbalance. Our paper presents a new approach to few-shot classification, where we employ the knowledge-base of multiple pre-trained convolutional models that act as the backbone for our proposed few-shot framework. Our framework uses a novel ensembling technique for boosting the accuracy while drastically decreasing the total parameter count, thus paving the way for real-time implementation. We perform an extensive hyperparameter search using a power-line defect detection dataset and obtain an accuracy of 92.30% for the 5-way 5-shot task. Without further tuning, we evaluate our model on competing standards with the existing state-of-the-art methods and outperform them.

**Abstract:** In electronic health records (EHRs), irregular time-series (ITS) occur naturally due to patient health dynamics, reflected by irregular hospital visits, diseases/conditions and the necessity to measure different vitals signs at each visit etc. ITS present challenges in training machine learning algorithms which mostly are built on assumption of coherent fixed dimensional feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel COntinuous patient state PERceiver model, called COPER, to cope with ITS in EHRs. COPER uses Perceiver model and the concept of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to learn the continuous time dynamics of patient state, i.e., continuity of input space and continuity of output space. The neural ODEs help COPER to generate regular time-series to feed to Perceiver model which has the capability to handle multi-modality large-scale inputs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we use in-hospital mortality prediction task on MIMIC-III dataset and carefully design experiments to study irregularity. The results are compared with the baselines which prove the efficacy of the proposed model.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in the fingerprinting of deep neural networks detect instances of models, placed in a black-box interaction scheme. Inputs used by the fingerprinting protocols are specifically crafted for each precise model to be checked for. While efficient in such a scenario, this nevertheless results in a lack of guarantee after a mere modification (like retraining, quantization) of a model. This paper tackles the challenges to propose i) fingerprinting schemes that are resilient to significant modifications of the models, by generalizing to the notion of model families and their variants, ii) an extension of the fingerprinting task encompassing scenarios where one wants to fingerprint not only a precise model (previously referred to as a detection task) but also to identify which model family is in the black-box (identification task). We achieve both goals by demonstrating that benign inputs, that are unmodified images, for instance, are sufficient material for both tasks. We leverage an information-theoretic scheme for the identification task. We devise a greedy discrimination algorithm for the detection task. Both approaches are experimentally validated over an unprecedented set of more than 1,000 networks.

**Abstract:** Deep Learning (DL) methods have shown promising results for solving ill-posed inverse problems such as MR image reconstruction from undersampled $k$-space data. However, these approaches currently have no guarantees for reconstruction quality and the reliability of such algorithms is only poorly understood. Adversarial attacks offer a valuable tool to understand possible failure modes and worst case performance of DL-based reconstruction algorithms. In this paper we describe adversarial attacks on multi-coil $k$-space measurements and evaluate them on the recently proposed E2E-VarNet and a simpler UNet-based model. In contrast to prior work, the attacks are targeted to specifically alter diagnostically relevant regions. Using two realistic attack models (adversarial $k$-space noise and adversarial rotations) we are able to show that current state-of-the-art DL-based reconstruction algorithms are indeed sensitive to such perturbations to a degree where relevant diagnostic information may be lost. Surprisingly, in our experiments the UNet and the more sophisticated E2E-VarNet were similarly sensitive to such attacks. Our findings add further to the evidence that caution must be exercised as DL-based methods move closer to clinical practice.

**Abstract:** On the medical images, many of the tissues/lesions may be ambiguous. That is why the medical segmentation is typically annotated by a group of clinical experts to mitigate the personal bias. However, this clinical routine also brings new challenges to the application of machine learning algorithms. Without a definite ground-truth, it will be difficult to train and evaluate the deep learning models. When the annotations are collected from different graders, a common choice is majority vote. However such a strategy ignores the difference between the grader expertness. In this paper, we consider the task of predicting the segmentation with the calibrated inter-observer uncertainty. We note that in clinical practice, the medical image segmentation is usually used to assist the disease diagnosis. Inspired by this observation, we propose diagnosis-first principle, which is to take disease diagnosis as the criterion to calibrate the inter-observer segmentation uncertainty. Following this idea, a framework named Diagnosis First segmentation Framework (DiFF) is proposed to estimate diagnosis-first segmentation from the raw images.Specifically, DiFF will first learn to fuse the multi-rater segmentation labels to a single ground-truth which could maximize the disease diagnosis performance. We dubbed the fused ground-truth as Diagnosis First Ground-truth (DF-GT).Then, we further propose Take and Give Modelto segment DF-GT from the raw image. We verify the effectiveness of DiFF on three different medical segmentation tasks: OD/OC segmentation on fundus images, thyroid nodule segmentation on ultrasound images, and skin lesion segmentation on dermoscopic images. Experimental results show that the proposed DiFF is able to significantly facilitate the corresponding disease diagnosis, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art multi-rater learning methods.

**Abstract:** Predicting the novel effects of drugs based on information about approved drugs can be regarded as a recommendation system. Matrix factorization is one of the most used recommendation systems and various algorithms have been devised for it. A literature survey and summary of existing algorithms for predicting drug effects demonstrated that most such methods, including neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization, which was the best performer in benchmark tests, used a binary matrix that considers only the presence or absence of interactions. However, drug effects are known to have two opposite aspects, such as side effects and therapeutic effects. In the present study, we proposed using neighborhood regularized bidirectional matrix factorization (NRBdMF) to predict drug effects by incorporating bidirectionality, which is a characteristic property of drug effects. We used this proposed method for predicting side effects using a matrix that considered the bidirectionality of drug effects, in which known side effects were assigned a positive label (plus 1) and known treatment effects were assigned a negative (minus 1) label. The NRBdMF model, which utilizes drug bidirectional information, achieved enrichment of side effects at the top and indications at the bottom of the prediction list. This first attempt to consider the bidirectional nature of drug effects using NRBdMF showed that it reduced false positives and produced a highly interpretable output.

**Abstract:** Video 3D human pose estimation aims to localize the 3D coordinates of human joints from videos. Recent transformer-based approaches focus on capturing the spatiotemporal information from sequential 2D poses, which cannot model the contextual depth feature effectively since the visual depth features are lost in the step of 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we simplify the paradigm into an end-to-end framework, Instance-guided Video Transformer (IVT), which enables learning spatiotemporal contextual depth information from visual features effectively and predicts 3D poses directly from video frames. In particular, we firstly formulate video frames as a series of instance-guided tokens and each token is in charge of predicting the 3D pose of a human instance. These tokens contain body structure information since they are extracted by the guidance of joint offsets from the human center to the corresponding body joints. Then, these tokens are sent into IVT for learning spatiotemporal contextual depth. In addition, we propose a cross-scale instance-guided attention mechanism to handle the variational scales among multiple persons. Finally, the 3D poses of each person are decoded from instance-guided tokens by coordinate regression. Experiments on three widely-used 3D pose estimation benchmarks show that the proposed IVT achieves state-of-the-art performances.

**Abstract:** This study aims to enable more reliable automated post-disaster building damage classification using artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-view imagery. The current practices and research efforts in adopting AI for post-disaster damage assessment are generally (a) qualitative, lacking refined classification of building damage levels based on standard damage scales, and (b) trained based on aerial or satellite imagery with limited views, which, although indicative, are not completely descriptive of the damage scale. To enable more accurate and reliable automated quantification of damage levels, the present study proposes the use of more comprehensive visual data in the form of multiple ground and aerial views of the buildings. To have such a spatially-aware damage prediction model, a Multi-view Convolution Neural Network (MV-CNN) architecture is used that combines the information from different views of a damaged building. This spatial 3D context damage information will result in more accurate identification of damages and reliable quantification of damage levels. The proposed model is trained and validated on reconnaissance visual dataset containing expert-labeled, geotagged images of the inspected buildings following hurricane Harvey. The developed model demonstrates reasonably good accuracy in predicting the damage levels and can be used to support more informed and reliable AI-assisted disaster management practices.

**Abstract:** In recent years, the dominant paradigm for text spotting is to combine the tasks of text detection and recognition into a single end-to-end framework. Under this paradigm, both tasks are accomplished by operating over a shared global feature map extracted from the input image. Among the main challenges that end-to-end approaches face is the performance degradation when recognizing text across scale variations (smaller or larger text), and arbitrary word rotation angles. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a novel global-to-local attention mechanism for text spotting, termed GLASS, that fuses together global and local features. The global features are extracted from the shared backbone, preserving contextual information from the entire image, while the local features are computed individually on resized, high-resolution rotated word crops. The information extracted from the local crops alleviates much of the inherent difficulties with scale and word rotation. We show a performance analysis across scales and angles, highlighting improvement over scale and angle extremities. In addition, we introduce an orientation-aware loss term supervising the detection task, and show its contribution to both detection and recognition performance across all angles. Finally, we show that GLASS is general by incorporating it into other leading text spotting architectures, improving their text spotting performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including the newly released TextOCR.

**Abstract:** The execution of processes leaves traces of event data in information systems. These event data can be analyzed through process mining techniques. For traditional process mining techniques, one has to associate each event with exactly one object, e.g., the company's customer. Events related to one object form an event sequence called a case. A case describes an end-to-end run through a process. The cases contained in event data can be used to discover a process model, detect frequent bottlenecks, or learn predictive models. However, events encountered in real-life information systems, e.g., ERP systems, can often be associated with multiple objects. The traditional sequential case concept falls short of these object-centric event data as these data exhibit a graph structure. One might force object-centric event data into the traditional case concept by flattening it. However, flattening manipulates the data and removes information. Therefore, a concept analogous to the case concept of traditional event logs is necessary to enable the application of different process mining tasks on object-centric event data. In this paper, we introduce the case concept for object-centric process mining: process executions. These are graph-based generalizations of cases as considered in traditional process mining. Furthermore, we provide techniques to extract process executions. Based on these executions, we determine equivalent process behavior with respect to an attribute using graph isomorphism. Equivalent process executions with respect to the event's activity are object-centric variants, i.e., a generalization of variants in traditional process mining. We provide a visualization technique for object-centric variants. The contribution's scalability and efficiency are extensively evaluated. Furthermore, we provide a case study showing the most frequent object-centric variants of a real-life event log.

**Abstract:** Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful declarative programming paradigm commonly used for solving challenging search and optimization problems. The modeling languages of ASP are supported by sophisticated solving algorithms (solvers) that make the solution search efficient while enabling the programmer to model the problem at a high level of abstraction. As an approach to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, ASP benefits from its simplicity, conciseness and rigorously defined semantics. These characteristics make ASP a straightforward way to develop formally verifiable programs. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), the clarity of ASP programs lends itself to the construction of explainable, trustworthy AI. In support of these goals, my research is concerned with extending the theory and tools supporting the verification of ASP progams.

**Abstract:** Collective decision-making is vital for recent information and communications technologies. In our previous research, we mathematically derived conflict-free joint decision-making that optimally satisfies players' probabilistic preference profiles. However, two problems exist regarding the optimal joint decision-making method. First, as the number of choices increases, the computational cost of calculating the optimal joint selection probability matrix explodes. Second, to derive the optimal joint selection probability matrix, all players must disclose their probabilistic preferences. Now, it is noteworthy that explicit calculation of the joint probability distribution is not necessarily needed; what is necessary for collective decisions is sampling. This study examines several sampling methods that converge to heuristic joint selection probability matrices that satisfy players' preferences. We show that they can significantly reduce the above problems of computational cost and confidentiality. We analyze the probability distribution each of the sampling methods converges to, as well as the computational cost required and the confidentiality secured. In particular, we introduce two conflict-free joint sampling methods through quantum interference of photons. The first system allows the players to hide their choices while satisfying the players' preferences almost perfectly when they have the same preferences. The second system, where the physical nature of light replaces the expensive computational cost, also conceals their choices under the assumption that they have a trusted third party.

**Abstract:** Purpose: Provide a closed-form solution to the sinusoidal coil sensitivity model proposed by Kern et al. This closed-form allows for precise computations of varied, simulated bias fields for ground-truth debias datasets.
  Methods: Fourier distribution theory and standard integration techniques were used to calculate the Fourier transform for line segment magnetic fields.
  Results: A $L^1_{\rm loc}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ function is derived in full generality for arbitrary line segment geometries. Sampling criteria and equivalence to the original sinusoidal model are also discussed. Lastly a CUDA accelerated implementation $\texttt{biasgen}$ is provided by authors.
  Conclusion: As the derived result is influenced by coil positioning and geometry, practitioners will have access to a more diverse ecosystem of simulated datasets which may be used to compare prospective debiasing methods.

**Abstract:** Due to inadequate energy captured by the hyperspectral camera sensor in poor illumination conditions, low-light hyperspectral images (HSIs) usually suffer from low visibility, spectral distortion, and various noises. A range of HSI restoration methods have been developed, yet their effectiveness in enhancing low-light HSIs is constrained. This work focuses on the low-light HSI enhancement task, which aims to reveal the spatial-spectral information hidden in darkened areas. To facilitate the development of low-light HSI processing, we collect a low-light HSI (LHSI) dataset of both indoor and outdoor scenes. Based on Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction, we developed an end-to-end data-driven low-light HSI enhancement (HSIE) approach trained on the LHSI dataset. With the observation that illumination is related to the low-frequency component of HSI, while textural details are closely correlated to the high-frequency component, the proposed HSIE is designed to have two branches. The illumination enhancement branch is adopted to enlighten the low-frequency component with reduced resolution. The high-frequency refinement branch is utilized for refining the high-frequency component via a predicted mask. In addition, to improve information flow and boost performance, we introduce an effective channel attention block (CAB) with residual dense connection, which served as the basic block of the illumination enhancement branch. The effectiveness and efficiency of HSIE both in quantitative assessment measures and visual effects are demonstrated by experimental results on the LHSI dataset. According to the classification performance on the remote sensing Indian Pines dataset, downstream tasks benefit from the enhanced HSI.

**Abstract:** In-vitro tests are an alternative to animal testing for the toxicity of medical devices. Detecting cells as a first step, a cell expert evaluates the growth of cells according to cytotoxicity grade under the microscope. Thus, human fatigue plays a role in error making, making the use of deep learning appealing. Due to the high cost of training data annotation, an approach without manual annotation is needed. We propose Seamless Iterative Semi-Supervised correction of Imperfect labels (SISSI), a new method for training object detection models with noisy and missing annotations in a semi-supervised fashion. Our network learns from noisy labels generated with simple image processing algorithms, which are iteratively corrected during self-training. Due to the nature of missing bounding boxes in the pseudo labels, which would negatively affect the training, we propose to train on dynamically generated synthetic-like images using seamless cloning. Our method successfully provides an adaptive early learning correction technique for object detection. The combination of early learning correction that has been applied in classification and semantic segmentation before and synthetic-like image generation proves to be more effective than the usual semi-supervised approach by > 15% AP and > 20% AR across three different readers. Our code is available at https://github.com/marwankefah/SISSI.

**Abstract:** In image super-resolution, both pixel-wise accuracy and perceptual fidelity are desirable. However, most deep learning methods only achieve high performance in one aspect due to the perception-distortion trade-off, and works that successfully balance the trade-off rely on fusing results from separately trained models with ad-hoc post-processing. In this paper, we propose a novel super-resolution model with a low-frequency constraint (LFc-SR), which balances the objective and perceptual quality through a single model and yields super-resolved images with high PSNR and perceptual scores. We further introduce an ADMM-based alternating optimization method for the non-trivial learning of the constrained model. Experiments showed that our method, without cumbersome post-processing procedures, achieved the state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuehan717/PDASR.

**Abstract:** Discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) is a widely employed computational method to study plasticity at the mesoscale that connects the motion of dislocation lines to the macroscopic response of crystalline materials. However, the computational cost of DDD simulations remains a bottleneck that limits its range of applicability. Here, we introduce a new DDD-GNN framework in which the expensive time-integration of dislocation motion is entirely substituted by a graph neural network (GNN) model trained on DDD trajectories. As a first application, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our method on a simple yet relevant model of a dislocation line gliding through a forest of obstacles. We show that the DDD-GNN model is stable and reproduces very well unseen ground-truth DDD simulation responses for a range of straining rates and obstacle densities, without the need to explicitly compute nodal forces or dislocation mobilities during time-integration. Our approach opens new promising avenues to accelerate DDD simulations and to incorporate more complex dislocation motion behaviors.

**Abstract:** In recent years, researchers have created and introduced a significant number of various code generation models. As human evaluation of every new model version is unfeasible, the community adopted automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU to approximate the results of human judgement. These metrics originate from the machine translation domain and it is unclear whether they are applicable for the code generation tasks and how well do they agree with the human evaluation on this task. There also are two metrics, CodeBLEU and RUBY, that were developed to estimate the similarity of code and take into account the code properties. However, for these metrics there are hardly any studies on their agreement with the human evaluation. Despite all that, minimal differences in the metric scores are used to claim superiority of some code generation models over the others.
  In this paper, we present a study on applicability of six metrics -- BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, ChrF, CodeBLEU, RUBY -- for evaluation of the code generation models. We conduct a study on two different code generation datasets and use human annotators to assess the quality of all models run on these datasets. The results indicate that for the CoNaLa dataset of Python one-liners none of the metrics can correctly emulate human judgement on which model is better with $>95\%$ certainty if the difference in model scores is less than 5 points. For the HearthStone dataset, which consists of classes of particular structure, the difference in model scores of at least 2 points is enough to claim the superiority of one model over the other. Using our findings, we derive several recommendations on using metrics to estimate the model performance on the code generation task.

**Abstract:** When solving combinatorial problems, pruning symmetric solution candidates from the search space is essential. Most of the existing approaches are instance-specific and focus on the automatic computation of Symmetry Breaking Constraints (SBCs) for each given problem instance. However, the application of such approaches to large-scale instances or advanced problem encodings might be problematic since the computed SBCs are propositional and, therefore, can neither be meaningfully interpreted nor transferred to other instances. As a result, a time-consuming recomputation of SBCs must be done before every invocation of a solver.  To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new model-oriented approach for Answer Set Programming that lifts the SBCs of small problem instances into a set of interpretable first-order constraints using a form of machine learning called Inductive Logic Programming. After targeting simple combinatorial problems, we aim to extend our method to be applied also for advanced decision and optimization problems.

**Abstract:** A large class of non-smooth practical optimization problems can be written as minimization of a sum of smooth and partly smooth functions. We consider such structured problems which also depend on a parameter vector and study the problem of differentiating its solution mapping with respect to the parameter which has far reaching applications in sensitivity analysis and parameter learning optmization problems. We show that under partial smoothness and other mild assumptions, Automatic Differentiation (AD) of the sequence generated by proximal splitting algorithms converges to the derivative of the solution mapping. For a variant of automatic differentiation, which we call Fixed-Point Automatic Differentiation (FPAD), we remedy the memory overhead problem of the Reverse Mode AD and moreover provide faster convergence theoretically. We numerically illustrate the convergence and convergence rates of AD and FPAD on Lasso and Group Lasso problems and demonstrate the working of FPAD on prototypical practical image denoising problem by learning the regularization term.

**Abstract:** In neuroimaging analysis, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can well assess brain function changes for brain diseases with no obvious structural lesions. So far, most deep-learning-based fMRI studies take functional connectivity as the basic feature in disease classification. However, functional connectivity is often calculated based on time series of predefined regions of interest and neglects detailed information contained in each voxel, which may accordingly deteriorate the performance of diagnostic models. Another methodological drawback is the limited sample size for the training of deep models. In this study, we propose BrainFormer, a general hybrid Transformer architecture for brain disease classification with single fMRI volume to fully exploit the voxel-wise details with sufficient data dimensions and sizes. BrainFormer is constructed by modeling the local cues within each voxel with 3D convolutions and capturing the global relations among distant regions with two global attention blocks. The local and global cues are aggregated in BrainFormer by a single-stream model. To handle multisite data, we propose a normalization layer to normalize the data into identical distribution. Finally, a Gradient-based Localization-map Visualization method is utilized for locating the possible disease-related biomarker. We evaluate BrainFormer on five independently acquired datasets including ABIDE, ADNI, MPILMBB, ADHD-200 and ECHO, with diseases of autism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and headache disorders. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of BrainFormer for multiple brain diseases diagnosis. BrainFormer may promote neuroimaging-based precision diagnosis in clinical practice and motivate future study in fMRI analysis. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZiyaoZhangforPCL/BrainFormer.
