**Abstract:** Hybrid storage systems (HSS) use multiple different storage devices to provide high and scalable storage capacity at high performance. Recent research proposes various techniques that aim to accurately identify performance-critical data to place it in a "best-fit" storage device. Unfortunately, most of these techniques are rigid, which (1) limits their adaptivity to perform well for a wide range of workloads and storage device configurations, and (2) makes it difficult for designers to extend these techniques to different storage system configurations (e.g., with a different number or different types of storage devices) than the configuration they are designed for. We introduce Sibyl, the first technique that uses reinforcement learning for data placement in hybrid storage systems. Sibyl observes different features of the running workload as well as the storage devices to make system-aware data placement decisions. For every decision it makes, Sibyl receives a reward from the system that it uses to evaluate the long-term performance impact of its decision and continuously optimizes its data placement policy online. We implement Sibyl on real systems with various HSS configurations. Our results show that Sibyl provides 21.6%/19.9% performance improvement in a performance-oriented/cost-oriented HSS configuration compared to the best previous data placement technique. Our evaluation using an HSS configuration with three different storage devices shows that Sibyl outperforms the state-of-the-art data placement policy by 23.9%-48.2%, while significantly reducing the system architect's burden in designing a data placement mechanism that can simultaneously incorporate three storage devices. We show that Sibyl achieves 80% of the performance of an oracle policy that has complete knowledge of future access patterns while incurring a very modest storage overhead of only 124.4 KiB.

**Abstract:** Algorithms provide powerful tools for detecting and dissecting human bias and error. Here, we develop machine learning methods to to analyze how humans err in a particular high-stakes task: image interpretation. We leverage a unique dataset of 16,135,392 human predictions of whether a neighborhood voted for Donald Trump or Joe Biden in the 2020 US election, based on a Google Street View image. We show that by training a machine learning estimator of the Bayes optimal decision for each image, we can provide an actionable decomposition of human error into bias, variance, and noise terms, and further identify specific features (like pickup trucks) which lead humans astray. Our methods can be applied to ensure that human-in-the-loop decision-making is accurate and fair and are also applicable to black-box algorithmic systems.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning framework for continually learning representations for new sound classes. The proposed system relies on a continually trained neural encoder that is trained with similarity-based learning objectives without using labels. We show that representations learned with the proposed method generalize better and are less susceptible to catastrophic forgetting than fully-supervised approaches. Remarkably, our technique does not store past data or models and is more computationally efficient than distillation-based methods. To accurately assess the system performance, in addition to using existing protocols, we propose two realistic evaluation protocols that use only a small amount of labeled data to simulate practical use cases.

**Abstract:** Coreference resolution -- which is a crucial task for understanding discourse and language at large -- has yet to witness widespread benefits from large language models (LLMs). Moreover, coreference resolution systems largely rely on supervised labels, which are highly expensive and difficult to annotate, thus making it ripe for prompt engineering. In this paper, we introduce a QA-based prompt-engineering method and discern \textit{generative}, pre-trained LLMs' abilities and limitations toward the task of coreference resolution. Our experiments show that GPT-2 and GPT-Neo can return valid answers, but that their capabilities to identify coreferent mentions are limited and prompt-sensitive, leading to inconsistent results.

**Abstract:** A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to estimate the speed of a car driving in an urban area using as input a stream of measurements from a low-cost six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU). Three hours of data was collected by driving through the city of Ashdod, Israel in a car equipped with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real time kinematic (RTK) positioning device and a synchronized IMU. Ground truth labels for the car speed were calculated using the position measurements obtained at the high rate of 50 [Hz]. A DNN architecture with long short-term memory layers is proposed to enable high-frequency speed estimation that accounts for previous inputs history and the nonlinear relation between speed, acceleration, and angular velocity. A simplified aided dead reckoning localization scheme is formulated to assess the trained model which provides the speed pseudo-measurement. The trained model is shown to substantially improve the position accuracy during a 4 minutes drive without the use of GNSS position updates.

**Abstract:** The fast execution speed and energy efficiency of analog hardware has made them a strong contender for deployment of deep learning model at the edge. However, there are concerns about the presence of analog noise which causes changes to the weight of the models, leading to performance degradation of deep learning model, despite their inherent noise resistant characteristics. The effect of the popular batch normalization layer on the noise resistant ability of deep learning model is investigated in this work. This systematic study has been carried out by first training different models with and without batch normalization layer on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset. The weights of the resulting models are then injected with analog noise and the performance of the models on the test dataset is obtained and compared. The results show that the presence of batch normalization layer negatively impacts noise resistant property of deep learning model and the impact grows with the increase of the number of batch normalization layers.

**Abstract:** The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has attracted attention because it can explain why over-parameterized models often show high generalization ability. It is known that when we use iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), which is an algorithm to find sparse networks with high generalization ability that can be trained from the initial weights independently, called winning tickets, the initial large learning rate does not work well in deep neural networks such as ResNet. However, since the initial large learning rate generally helps the optimizer to converge to flatter minima, we hypothesize that the winning tickets have relatively sharp minima, which is considered a disadvantage in terms of generalization ability. In this paper, we confirm this hypothesis and show that the PAC-Bayesian theory can provide an explicit understanding of the relationship between LTH and generalization behavior. On the basis of our experimental findings that flatness is useful for improving accuracy and robustness to label noise and that the distance from the initial weights is deeply involved in winning tickets, we offer the PAC-Bayes bound using a spike-and-slab distribution to analyze winning tickets. Finally, we revisit existing algorithms for finding winning tickets from a PAC-Bayesian perspective and provide new insights into these methods.

**Abstract:** Deep-learning-based local feature extraction algorithms that combine detection and description have made significant progress in visible image matching. However, the end-to-end training of such frameworks is notoriously unstable due to the lack of strong supervision of detection and the inappropriate coupling between detection and description. The problem is magnified in cross-modal scenarios, in which most methods heavily rely on the pre-training. In this paper, we recouple independent constraints of detection and description of multimodal feature learning with a mutual weighting strategy, in which the detected probabilities of robust features are forced to peak and repeat, while features with high detection scores are emphasized during optimization. Different from previous works, those weights are detached from back propagation so that the detected probability of indistinct features would not be directly suppressed and the training would be more stable. Moreover, we propose the Super Detector, a detector that possesses a large receptive field and is equipped with learnable non-maximum suppression layers, to fulfill the harsh terms of detection. Finally, we build a benchmark that contains cross visible, infrared, near-infrared and synthetic aperture radar image pairs for evaluating the performance of features in feature matching and image registration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that features trained with the recoulped detection and description, named ReDFeat, surpass previous state-of-the-arts in the benchmark, while the model can be readily trained from scratch.

**Abstract:** Analysing music in the field of machine learning is a very difficult problem with numerous constraints to consider. The nature of audio data, with its very high dimensionality and widely varying scales of structure, is one of the primary reasons why it is so difficult to model. There are many applications of machine learning in music, like the classifying the mood of a piece of music, conditional music generation, or popularity prediction. The goal for this project was to develop a genre-conditional generative model of music based on Mel spectrograms and evaluate its performance by comparing it to existing generative music models that use note-based representations. We initially implemented an autoregressive, RNN-based generative model called MelNet . However, due to its slow speed and low fidelity output, we decided to create a new, fully convolutional architecture that is based on the MelGAN [4] and conditional GAN architectures, called cMelGAN.

**Abstract:** As robots are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios, a key question is how to best transfer knowledge learned in one environment to another, where shifting constraints and human preferences render adaptation challenging. A central challenge remains that often, it is difficult (perhaps even impossible) to capture the full complexity of the deployment environment, and therefore the desired tasks, at training time. Consequently, the representation, or abstraction, of the tasks the human hopes for the robot to perform in one environment may be misaligned with the representation of the tasks that the robot has learned in another. We postulate that because humans will be the ultimate evaluator of system success in the world, they are best suited to communicating the aspects of the tasks that matter to the robot. Our key insight is that effective learning from human input requires first explicitly learning good intermediate representations and then using those representations for solving downstream tasks. We highlight three areas where we can use this approach to build interactive systems and offer future directions of work to better create advanced collaborative robots.

<p>

**Abstract:** We assume that the state of a number of nodes in a network could be investigated if necessary, and study what configuration of those nodes could facilitate a better solution for the diffusion-source-localization (DSL) problem. In particular, we formulate a candidate set which contains the diffusion source for sure, and propose the method, Percolation-based Evolutionary Framework (PrEF), to minimize such set. Hence one could further conduct more intensive investigation on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSL problem and the network immunization problem. We find that the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both model and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve a much smaller candidate set compared to the state of the art in almost all cases. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it has similar performance irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and outbreak ranges. More importantly, our approach might provide a new framework to tackle the DSL problem in extreme large networks.

**Abstract:** Next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys are expected to provide valuable information about the primordial universe by creating maps of the mass along the line of sight. Traditional tools for creating these lensing convergence maps include the quadratic estimator and the maximum likelihood based iterative estimator. Here, we apply a generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct the lensing convergence field. We compare our results with a previous deep learning approach -- Residual-UNet -- and discuss the pros and cons of each. In the process, we use training sets generated by a variety of power spectra, rather than the one used in testing the methods.

**Abstract:** We explain equivariant neural networks, a notion underlying breakthroughs in machine learning from deep convolutional neural networks for computer vision to AlphaFold 2 for protein structure prediction, without assuming knowledge of equivariance or neural networks. The basic mathematical ideas are simple but are often obscured by engineering complications that come with practical realizations. We extract and focus on the mathematical aspects, and limit ourselves to a cursory treatment of the engineering issues at the end.

<p>

**Abstract:** Current approaches for controlling dialogue response generation are primarily focused on high-level attributes like style, sentiment, or topic. In this work, we focus on constrained long-term dialogue generation, which involves more fine-grained control and requires a given set of control words to appear in generated responses. This setting requires a model to not only consider the generation of these control words in the immediate context, but also produce utterances that will encourage the generation of the words at some time in the (possibly distant) future. We define the problem of constrained long-term control for dialogue generation, identify gaps in current methods for evaluation, and propose new metrics that better measure long-term control. We also propose a retrieval-augmented method that improves performance of long-term controlled generation via logit modification techniques. We show through experiments on three task-oriented dialogue datasets that our metrics better assess dialogue control relative to current alternatives and that our method outperforms state-of-the-art constrained generation baselines.

**Abstract:** Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in designing novel chemical compounds with desirable pharmaceutical properties. In this work, we focus on a new type of drug design problem -- generating a small "linker" to physically attach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main computational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional on the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from scratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the two molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures and orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes, for which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems, we propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to predict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures based on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know, there are no previous models that could achieve this task. We compare our model with multiple conditional generative models modified from other molecular design tasks and find that our model has a significantly higher rate in recovering molecular graphs, and more importantly, accurately predicting the 3D coordinates of all the atoms.

**Abstract:** This review presents a comprehensive study on the role of GANs in addressing the challenges related to COVID-19 data scarcity and diagnosis. It is the first review that summarizes the different GANs methods and the lungs images datasets for COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of GANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the availability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images data. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications of GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images. The cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures used in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies used CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47), the experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available data. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was reported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have great potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of COVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Besides, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs performance through the super-resolution of the images and segmentation. This review also identified key limitations of the potential transformation of GANs based methods in clinical applications.

**Abstract:** Binary neural network leverages the $Sign$ function to binarize real values, and its non-derivative property inevitably brings huge gradient errors during backpropagation. Although many hand-designed soft functions have been proposed to approximate gradients, their mechanism is not clear and there are still huge performance gaps between binary models and their full-precision counterparts. To address this, we propose to tackle network binarization as a binary classification problem and use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the classifier. The MLP-based classifier can fit any continuous function theoretically and is adaptively learned to binarize networks and backpropagate gradients without any specific soft function. With this view, we further prove experimentally that even a simple linear function can outperform previous complex soft functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields surprising performance both in image classification and human pose estimation tasks. Specifically, we achieve 65.7% top-1 accuracy of ResNet-34 on ImageNet dataset, with an absolute improvement of 2.8%. When evaluating on the challenging Microsoft COCO keypoint dataset, the proposed method enables binary networks to achieve a mAP of 60.6 for the first time, on par with some full-precision methods.

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a series of competent graph learning methods for diverse real-world scenarios, ranging from daily applications like recommendation systems and question answering to cutting-edge technologies such as drug discovery in life sciences and n-body simulation in astrophysics. However, task performance is not the only requirement for GNNs. Performance-oriented GNNs have exhibited potential adverse effects like vulnerability to adversarial attacks, unexplainable discrimination against disadvantaged groups, or excessive resource consumption in edge computing environments. To avoid these unintentional harms, it is necessary to build competent GNNs characterised by trustworthiness. To this end, we propose a comprehensive roadmap to build trustworthy GNNs from the view of the various computing technologies involved. In this survey, we introduce basic concepts and comprehensively summarise existing efforts for trustworthy GNNs from six aspects, including robustness, explainability, privacy, fairness, accountability, and environmental well-being. Additionally, we highlight the intricate cross-aspect relations between the above six aspects of trustworthy GNNs. Finally, we present a thorough overview of trending directions for facilitating the research and industrialisation of trustworthy GNNs.

**Abstract:** It is challenging to guide neural network (NN) learning with prior knowledge. In contrast, many known properties, such as spatial smoothness or seasonality, are straightforward to model by choosing an appropriate kernel in a Gaussian process (GP). Many deep learning applications could be enhanced by modeling such known properties. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are frequently used in remote sensing, which is subject to strong seasonal effects. We propose to blend the strengths of deep learning and the clear modeling capabilities of GPs by using a composite kernel that combines a kernel implicitly defined by a neural network with a second kernel function chosen to model known properties (e.g., seasonality). Then, we approximate the resultant GP by combining a deep network and an efficient mapping based on the Nystrom approximation, which we call Implicit Composite Kernel (ICK). ICK is flexible and can be used to include prior information in neural networks in many applications. We demonstrate the strength of our framework by showing its superior performance and flexibility on both synthetic and real-world data sets. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICK_NNGP-17C5/.

**Abstract:** Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide array of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media platforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment apps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority of our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of 'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets.

**Abstract:** Solving general Markov decision processes (MDPs) is a computationally hard problem. Solving finite-horizon MDPs, on the other hand, is highly tractable with well known polynomial-time algorithms. What drives this extreme disparity, and do problems exist that lie between these diametrically opposed complexities? In this paper we identify and analyse a sub-class of stochastic shortest path problems (SSPs) for general state-action spaces whose dynamics satisfy a particular drift condition. This construction generalises the traditional, temporal notion of a horizon via decreasing reachability: a property called reductivity. It is shown that optimal policies can be recovered in polynomial-time for reductive SSPs -- via an extension of backwards induction -- with an efficient analogue in reductive MDPs. The practical considerations of the proposed approach are discussed, and numerical verification provided on a canonical optimal liquidation problem.

**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have motivated a rapid growth of the domain of computer image synthesis. As almost all the existing image synthesis algorithms consider an image as a pixel matrix, the high-resolution image synthesis is complicated.A good alternative can be vector images. However, they belong to the highly sophisticated parametric space, which is a restriction for solving the task of synthesizing vector graphics by GANs. In this paper, we consider a specific application domain that softens this restriction dramatically allowing the usage of vector image synthesis.
  Music cover images should meet the requirements of Internet streaming services and printing standards, which imply high resolution of graphic materials without any additional requirements on the content of such images. Existing music cover image generation services do not analyze tracks themselves; however, some services mostly consider only genre tags. To generate music covers as vector images that reflect the music and consist of simple geometric objects, we suggest a GAN-based algorithm called CoverGAN. The assessment of resulting images is based on their correspondence to the music compared with AttnGAN and DALL-E text-to-image generation according to title or lyrics. Moreover, the significance of the patterns found by CoverGAN has been evaluated in terms of the correspondence of the generated cover images to the musical tracks. Listeners evaluate the music covers generated by the proposed algorithm as quite satisfactory and corresponding to the tracks. Music cover images generation code and demo are available at https://github.com/IzhanVarsky/CoverGAN.

**Abstract:** Model attributions are important in deep neural networks as they aid practitioners in understanding the models, but recent studies reveal that attributions can be easily perturbed by adding imperceptible noise to the input. The non-differentiable Kendall's rank correlation is a key performance index for attribution protection. In this paper, we first show that the expected Kendall's rank correlation is positively correlated to cosine similarity and then indicate that the direction of attribution is the key to attribution robustness. Based on these findings, we explore the vector space of attribution to explain the shortcomings of attribution defense methods using $\ell_p$ norm and propose integrated gradient regularizer (IGR), which maximizes the cosine similarity between natural and perturbed attributions. Our analysis further exposes that IGR encourages neurons with the same activation states for natural samples and the corresponding perturbed samples, which is shown to induce robustness to gradient-based attribution methods. Our experiments on different models and datasets confirm our analysis on attribution protection and demonstrate a decent improvement in adversarial robustness.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a simple method for controllable text generation based on weighting logits produced, namely CAIF sampling. Using an arbitrary third-party text classifier, we adjust a small part of a language model's logits and guide text generation towards or away from classifier prediction. We show that the proposed method significantly outperforms recent PPLM, GeDi, and DExperts on PPL and sentiment accuracy based on the external classifier of generated texts. A the same time, it is also easier to implement and tune, and has significantly fewer restrictions and requirements.

**Abstract:** Customers' reviews and comments are important for businesses to understand users' sentiment about the products and services. However, this data needs to be analyzed to assess the sentiment associated with topics/aspects to provide efficient customer assistance. LDA and LSA fail to capture the semantic relationship and are not specific to any domain. In this study, we evaluate BERTopic, a novel method that generates topics using sentence embeddings on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) data. Our work shows that BERTopic is flexible and yet provides meaningful and diverse topics compared to LDA and LSA. Furthermore, domain-specific pre-trained embeddings (FinBERT) yield even better topics. We evaluated the topics on coherence score (c_v) and UMass.

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent systems make optimal decisions dependent on states observed by agents, but a little uncertainty on the observations can possibly mislead agents into taking wrong actions. The mean-field actor-critic reinforcement learning (MFAC) is very famous in the multi-agent field since it can effectively handle the scalability problem. However, this paper finds that it is also sensitive to state perturbations which can significantly degrade the team rewards. This paper proposes a robust learning framework for MFAC called RoMFAC that has two innovations: 1) a new objective function of training actors, composed of a \emph{policy gradient function} that is related to the expected cumulative discount reward on sampled clean states and an \emph{action loss function} that represents the difference between actions taken on clean and adversarial states; and 2) a repetitive regularization of the action loss that ensures the trained actors obtain a good performance. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed action loss function is convergent. Experiments show that RoMFAC is robust against adversarial perturbations while maintaining its good performance in environments without perturbations.

**Abstract:** Maximum Tsallis entropy (MTE) framework in reinforcement learning has gained popularity recently by virtue of its flexible modeling choices including the widely used Shannon entropy and sparse entropy. However, non-Shannon entropies suffer from approximation error and subsequent underperformance either due to its sensitivity or the lack of closed-form policy expression. To improve the tradeoff between flexibility and empirical performance, we propose to strengthen their error-robustness by enforcing implicit Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in MTE motivated by Munchausen DQN (MDQN). We do so by drawing connection between MDQN and advantage learning, by which MDQN is shown to fail on generalizing to the MTE framework. The proposed method Tsallis Advantage Learning (TAL) is verified on extensive experiments to not only significantly improve upon Tsallis-DQN for various non-closed-form Tsallis entropies, but also exhibits comparable performance to state-of-the-art maximum Shannon entropy algorithms.

**Abstract:** We propose and experimentally motivate a new methodology to support decision-making processes in healthcare with artificial intelligence based on personal rankings of care decision making steps that can be identified with our methodology, questionnaire data and its statistical patterns. Our longitudinal quantitative cross-sectional three-stage study gathered self-ratings for 437 expression statements concerning healthcare situations on Likert scales in respect to "the need for help", "the advancement of health", "the hopefulness", "the indication of compassion" and "the health condition", and 45 answers about the person's demographics, health and wellbeing, also the duration of giving answers. Online respondents between 1 June 2020 and 29 June 2021 were recruited from Finnish patient and disabled people's organizations, other health-related organizations and professionals, and educational institutions (n=1075). With Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test (i.e., Mann-Whitney U test), Wilcoxon rank-sum pairwise test, Welch's t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between groups test we identified statistically significant differences of ratings and their durations for each expression statement in respect to respondent groupings based on the answer values of each background question. Frequencies of the later reordering of rating rankings showed dependencies with ratings given earlier in respect to various interpretation task entities, interpretation dimensions and respondent groupings. Our methodology, questionnaire data and its statistical patterns enable analyzing with self-rated expression statements the representations of decision making steps in healthcare situations and their chaining, agglomeration and branching in knowledge entities of personalized care paths. Our results support building artificial intelligence solutions to address the patient's needs concerning care.

**Abstract:** Measuring contributions is a classical problem in cooperative game theory where the Shapley value is the most well-known solution concept. In this paper, we establish the convergence property of the Shapley value in parametric Bayesian learning games where players perform a Bayesian inference using their combined data, and the posterior-prior KL divergence is used as the characteristic function. We show that for any two players, under some regularity conditions, their difference in Shapley value converges in probability to the difference in Shapley value of a limiting game whose characteristic function is proportional to the log-determinant of the joint Fisher information. As an application, we present an online collaborative learning framework that is asymptotically Shapley-fair. Our result enables this to be achieved without any costly computations of posterior-prior KL divergences. Only a consistent estimator of the Fisher information is needed. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated with experiments using real-world data.

**Abstract:** In recent years, learning-based image registration methods have gradually moved away from direct supervision with target warps to instead use self-supervision, with excellent results in several registration benchmarks. These approaches utilize a loss function that penalizes the intensity differences between the fixed and moving images, along with a suitable regularizer on the deformation. In this paper, we argue that the relative failure of supervised registration approaches can in part be blamed on the use of regular U-Nets, which are jointly tasked with feature extraction, feature matching, and estimation of deformation. We introduce one simple but crucial modification to the U-Net that disentangles feature extraction and matching from deformation prediction, allowing the U-Net to warp the features, across levels, as the deformation field is evolved. With this modification, direct supervision using target warps begins to outperform self-supervision approaches that require segmentations, presenting new directions for registration when images do not have segmentations. We hope that our findings in this preliminary workshop paper will re-ignite research interest in supervised image registration techniques.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the statistical limits in terms of Sobolev norms of gradient descent for solving inverse problem from randomly sampled noisy observations using a general class of objective functions. Our class of objective functions includes Sobolev training for kernel regression, Deep Ritz Methods (DRM), and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) as special cases. We consider a potentially infinite-dimensional parameterization of our model using a suitable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and a continuous parameterization of problem hardness through the definition of kernel integral operators. We prove that gradient descent over this objective function can also achieve statistical optimality and the optimal number of passes over the data increases with sample size. Based on our theory, we explain an implicit acceleration of using a Sobolev norm as the objective function for training, inferring that the optimal number of epochs of DRM becomes larger than the number of PINN when both the data size and the hardness of tasks increase, although both DRM and PINN can achieve statistical optimality.

<p>

**Abstract:** Harms resulting from the development and deployment of facial processing technologies (FPT) have been met with increasing controversy. Several states and cities in the U.S. have banned the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and governments, but FPT are still being developed and used in a wide variety of contexts where they primarily are regulated by state biometric information privacy laws. Among these laws, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has generated a significant amount of litigation. Yet, with most BIPA lawsuits reaching settlements before there have been meaningful clarifications of relevant technical intricacies and legal definitions, there remains a great degree of uncertainty as to how exactly this law applies to FPT. What we have found through applications of BIPA in FPT litigation so far, however, points to potential disconnects between technical and legal communities. This paper analyzes what we know based on BIPA court proceedings and highlights these points of tension: areas where the technical operationalization of BIPA may create unintended and undesirable incentives for FPT development, as well as areas where BIPA litigation can bring to light the limitations of solely technical methods in achieving legal privacy values. These factors are relevant for (i) reasoning about biometric information privacy laws as a governing mechanism for FPT, (ii) assessing the potential harms of FPT, and (iii) providing incentives for the mitigation of these harms. By illuminating these considerations, we hope to empower courts and lawmakers to take a more nuanced approach to regulating FPT and developers to better understand privacy values in the current U.S. legal landscape.

**Abstract:** Pseudo labeling and consistency regularization approaches with confidence-based thresholding have made great progress in semi-supervised learning (SSL). In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze the relationship between the unlabeled data distribution and the desirable confidence threshold. Our analysis shows that previous methods might fail to define favorable threshold since they either require a pre-defined / fixed threshold or an ad-hoc threshold adjusting scheme that does not reflect the learning effect well, resulting in inferior performance and slow convergence, especially for complicated unlabeled data distributions. We hence propose \emph{FreeMatch} to define and adjust the confidence threshold in a self-adaptive manner according to the model's learning status. To handle complicated unlabeled data distributions more effectively, we further propose a self-adaptive class fairness regularization method that encourages the model to produce diverse predictions during training. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of FreeMatch especially when the labeled data are extremely rare. FreeMatch achieves \textbf{5.78}\%, \textbf{13.59}\%, and \textbf{1.28}\% error rate reduction over the latest state-of-the-art method FlexMatch on CIFAR-10 with 1 label per class, STL-10 with 4 labels per class, and ImageNet with 100k labels respectively.

**Abstract:** Large pre-trained neural language models have supported the effectiveness of many NLP tasks, yet are still prone to generating toxic language hindering the safety of their use. Using empathetic data, we improve over recent work on controllable text generation that aims to reduce the toxicity of generated text. We find we are able to dramatically reduce the size of fine-tuning data to 7.5-30k samples while at the same time making significant improvements over state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation of up to 3.4% absolute reduction (26% relative) from the original work on 2.3m samples, by strategically sampling data based on empathy scores. We observe that the degree of improvement is subject to specific communication components of empathy. In particular, the cognitive components of empathy significantly beat the original dataset in almost all experiments, while emotional empathy was tied to less improvement and even underperforming random samples of the original data. This is a particularly implicative insight for NLP work concerning empathy as until recently the research and resources built for it have exclusively considered empathy as an emotional concept.

**Abstract:** Imperfect-Information Extensive-Form Games (IIEFGs) is a prevalent model for real-world games involving imperfect information and sequential plays. The Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as a natural solution concept for multi-player general-sum IIEFGs. However, existing algorithms for finding an EFCE require full feedback from the game, and it remains open how to efficiently learn the EFCE in the more challenging bandit feedback setting where the game can only be learned by observations from repeated playing.
  This paper presents the first sample-efficient algorithm for learning the EFCE from bandit feedback. We begin by proposing $K$-EFCE -- a more generalized definition that allows players to observe and deviate from the recommended actions for $K$ times. The $K$-EFCE includes the EFCE as a special case at $K=1$, and is an increasingly stricter notion of equilibrium as $K$ increases. We then design an uncoupled no-regret algorithm that finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K}/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations in the full feedback setting, where $X_i$ and $A_i$ are the number of information sets and actions for the $i$-th player. Our algorithm works by minimizing a wide-range regret at each information set that takes into account all possible recommendation histories. Finally, we design a sample-based variant of our algorithm that learns an $\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K+1}/\varepsilon^2)$ episodes of play in the bandit feedback setting. When specialized to $K=1$, this gives the first sample-efficient algorithm for learning EFCE from bandit feedback.

**Abstract:** The fairness characteristic is a critical attribute of trusted AI systems. A plethora of research has proposed diverse methods for individual fairness testing. However, they are suffering from three major limitations, i.e., low efficiency, low effectiveness, and model-specificity. This work proposes ExpGA, an explanationguided fairness testing approach through a genetic algorithm (GA). ExpGA employs the explanation results generated by interpretable methods to collect high-quality initial seeds, which are prone to derive discriminatory samples by slightly modifying feature values. ExpGA then adopts GA to search discriminatory sample candidates by optimizing a fitness value. Benefiting from this combination of explanation results and GA, ExpGA is both efficient and effective to detect discriminatory individuals. Moreover, ExpGA only requires prediction probabilities of the tested model, resulting in a better generalization capability to various models. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmarks, including tabular and text datasets, show that ExpGA presents higher efficiency and effectiveness than four state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** The Chernoff bound is a well-known tool for obtaining a high probability bound on the expectation of a Bernoulli random variable in terms of its sample average. This bound is commonly used in statistical learning theory to upper bound the generalisation risk of a hypothesis in terms of its empirical risk on held-out data, for the case of a binary-valued loss function. However, the extension of this bound to the case of random variables taking values in the unit interval is less well known in the community. In this note we provide a proof of this extension for convenience and future reference.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning AI that uses sound as the input on the DareFightingICE platform at the DareFightingICE Competition in IEEE CoG 2022. In this work, an AI that only uses sound as the input is called blind AI. While state-of-the-art AIs rely mostly on visual or structured observations provided by their environments, learning to play games from only sound is still new and thus challenging. We propose different approaches to process audio data and use the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm for our blind AI. We also propose to use our blind AI in evaluation of sound designs submitted to the competition and define three metrics for this task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of not only our blind AI but also the proposed three metrics.

**Abstract:** The Matrix-based Renyi's entropy enables us to directly measure information quantities from given data without the costly probability density estimation of underlying distributions, thus has been widely adopted in numerous statistical learning and inference tasks. However, exactly calculating this new information quantity requires access to the eigenspectrum of a semi-positive definite (SPD) matrix $A$ which grows linearly with the number of samples $n$, resulting in a $O(n^3)$ time complexity that is prohibitive for large-scale applications. To address this issue, this paper takes advantage of stochastic trace approximations for matrix-based Renyi's entropy with arbitrary $Î±\in R^+$ orders, lowering the complexity by converting the entropy approximation to a matrix-vector multiplication problem. Specifically, we develop random approximations for integer order $Î±$ cases and polynomial series approximations (Taylor and Chebyshev) for non-integer $Î±$ cases, leading to a $O(n^2sm)$ overall time complexity, where $s,m \ll n$ denote the number of vector queries and the polynomial order respectively. We theoretically establish statistical guarantees for all approximation algorithms and give explicit order of s and m with respect to the approximation error $\varepsilon$, showing optimal convergence rate for both parameters up to a logarithmic factor. Large-scale simulations and real-world applications validate the effectiveness of the developed approximations, demonstrating remarkable speedup with negligible loss in accuracy.

Motivated by applications in sensor networks, we assume that the dataset is mixed where each sample is taken from a finite pool of Markov chains. Our bounds for learning kernels admit $O(\sqrt{\log m})$ dependency on the number of base kernels and $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ dependency on the number of training samples. However, some $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ terms are added to compensate for the dependency among samples compared with existing generalization bounds for multi-kernel learning with i.i.d. datasets.

**Abstract:** We investigate graph neural networks on graphs with heterophily. Some existing methods amplify a node's neighborhood with multi-hop neighbors to include more nodes with homophily. However, it is a significant challenge to set personalized neighborhood sizes for different nodes. Further, for other homophilous nodes excluded in the neighborhood, they are ignored for information aggregation. To address these problems, we propose two models GloGNN and GloGNN++, which generate a node's embedding by aggregating information from global nodes in the graph. In each layer, both models learn a coefficient matrix to capture the correlations between nodes, based on which neighborhood aggregation is performed. The coefficient matrix allows signed values and is derived from an optimization problem that has a closed-form solution. We further accelerate neighborhood aggregation and derive a linear time complexity. We theoretically explain the models' effectiveness by proving that both the coefficient matrix and the generated node embedding matrix have the desired grouping effect. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our models against 11 other competitors on 15 benchmark datasets in a wide range of domains, scales and graph heterophilies. Experimental results show that our methods achieve superior performance and are also very efficient.

**Abstract:** The pre-trained language model is trained on large-scale unlabeled text and can achieve state-of-the-art results in many different downstream tasks. However, the current pre-trained language model is mainly concentrated in the Chinese and English fields. For low resource language such as Tibetan, there is lack of a monolingual pre-trained model. To promote the development of Tibetan natural language processing tasks, this paper collects the large-scale training data from Tibetan websites and constructs a vocabulary that can cover 99.95$\%$ of the words in the corpus by using Sentencepiece. Then, we train the Tibetan monolingual pre-trained language model named TiBERT on the data and vocabulary. Finally, we apply TiBERT to the downstream tasks of text classification and question generation, and compare it with classic models and multilingual pre-trained models, the experimental results show that TiBERT can achieve the best performance.

**Abstract:** Several recent studies attempt to address the biological implausibility of the well-known backpropagation (BP) method. While promising methods such as feedback alignment, direct feedback alignment, and their variants like sign-concordant feedback alignment tackle BP's weight transport problem, their validity remains controversial owing to a set of other unsolved issues. In this work, we answer the question of whether it is possible to realize random backpropagation solely based on mechanisms observed in neuroscience. We propose a hypothetical framework consisting of a new microcircuit architecture and its supporting Hebbian learning rules. Comprising three types of cells and two types of synaptic connectivity, the proposed microcircuit architecture computes and propagates error signals through local feedback connections and supports the training of multi-layered spiking neural networks with a globally defined spiking error function. We employ the Hebbian rule operating in local compartments to update synaptic weights and achieve supervised learning in a biologically plausible manner. Finally, we interpret the proposed framework from an optimization point of view and show its equivalence to sign-concordant feedback alignment. The proposed framework is benchmarked on several datasets including MNIST and CIFAR10, demonstrating promising BP-comparable accuracy.

**Abstract:** To solve complex real-world problems, heuristics and concept-based approaches can be used in order to incorporate information into the problem. In this study, a concept-based approach called variable functioning Fx is introduced to reduce the optimization variables and narrow down the search space. In this method, the relationships among one or more subset of variables are defined with functions using information prior to optimization; thus, instead of modifying the variables in the search process, the function variables are optimized. By using problem structure analysis technique and engineering expert knowledge, the $Fx$ method is used to enhance the steel frame design optimization process as a complex real-world problem. The proposed approach is coupled with particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithms and used for three case studies. The algorithms are applied to optimize the case studies by considering the relationships among column cross-section areas. The results show that $Fx$ can significantly improve both the convergence rate and the final design of a frame structure, even if it is only used for seeding.

**Abstract:** The compositionality and sparsity of high-throughput sequencing data poses a challenge for regression and classification. However, in microbiome research in particular, conditional modeling is an essential tool to investigate relationships between phenotypes and the microbiome. Existing techniques are often inadequate: they either rely on extensions of the linear log-contrast model (which adjusts for compositionality, but is often unable to capture useful signals), or they are based on black-box machine learning methods (which may capture useful signals, but ignore compositionality in downstream analyses).
  We propose KernelBiome, a kernel-based nonparametric regression and classification framework for compositional data. It is tailored to sparse compositional data and is able to incorporate prior knowledge, such as phylogenetic structure. KernelBiome captures complex signals, including in the zero-structure, while automatically adapting model complexity. We demonstrate on par or improved predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Additionally, our framework provides two key advantages: (i) We propose two novel quantities to interpret contributions of individual components and prove that they consistently estimate average perturbation effects of the conditional mean, extending the interpretability of linear log-contrast models to nonparametric models. (ii) We show that the connection between kernels and distances aids interpretability and provides a data-driven embedding that can augment further analysis. Finally, we apply the KernelBiome framework to two public microbiome studies and illustrate the proposed model analysis. KernelBiome is available as an open-source Python package at https://github.com/shimenghuang/KernelBiome.

**Abstract:** Most graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on the message passing paradigm to propagate node features and build interactions. Recent works point out that different graph learning tasks require different ranges of interactions between nodes. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we explore the capacity of GNNs to capture pairwise interactions between nodes under contexts with different complexities, especially for their graph-level and node-level applications in scientific domains like biochemistry and physics. When formulating pairwise interactions, we study two standard graph construction methods in scientific domains, i.e., K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs and fully-connected (FC) graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inductive bias introduced by KNN-graphs and FC-graphs inhibits GNNs from learning the most informative order of interactions. Such a phenomenon is broadly shared by several GNNs for different graph learning tasks and prevents GNNs from reaching the global minimum loss, so we name it a representation bottleneck. To overcome that, we propose a novel graph rewiring approach based on the pairwise interaction strengths to adjust the reception fields of each node dynamically. Extensive experiments in molecular property prediction and dynamic system forecast prove the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art GNN baselines. Besides, this paper provides a reasonable explanation of why subgraphs play a vital role in determining graph properties. The code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/bottleneck.

**Abstract:** Independence and Conditional Independence (CI) are two fundamental concepts in probability and statistics, which can be applied to solve many central problems of statistical inference. There are many existing independence and CI measures defined from diverse principles and concepts. In this paper, the 16 independence measures and 16 CI measures were reviewed and then evaluated with simulated and real data. For the independence measures, eight simulated data were generating from normal distribution, normal and Archimedean copula functions to compare the measures in bivariate or multivariate, linear or nonlinear settings. Two UCI dataset, including the heart disease data and the wine quality data, were used to test the power of the independence measures in real conditions. For the CI measures, two simulated data with normal distribution and Gumbel copula, and one real data (the Beijing air data) were utilized to test the CI measures in prespecified linear or nonlinear setting and real scenario. From the experimental results, we found that most of the measures work well on the simulated data by presenting the right monotonicity of the simulations. However, the independence and CI measures were differentiated on much complex real data respectively and only a few can be considered as working well with reference to domain knowledge. We also found that the measures tend to be separated into groups based on the similarity of the behaviors of them in each setting and in general. According to the experiments, we recommend CE as a good choice for both independence and CI measure. This is also due to its rigorous distribution-free definition and consistent nonparametric estimator.

**Abstract:** In the research area of offline model-based optimization, novel and promising methods are frequently developed. However, implementing such methods in real-world industrial systems such as production lines for process control is oftentimes a frustrating process. In this work, we address two important problems to extend the current success of offline model-based optimization to industrial process control problems: 1) how to learn a reliable dynamics model from offline data for industrial processes? 2) how to learn a reliable but not over-conservative control policy from offline data by utilizing existing model-based optimization algorithms? Specifically, we propose a dynamics model based on ensemble of conditional generative adversarial networks to achieve accurate reward calculation in industrial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose an epistemic-uncertainty-penalized reward evaluation function which can effectively avoid giving over-estimated rewards to out-of-distribution inputs during the learning/searching of the optimal control policy. We provide extensive experiments with the proposed method on two representative cases (a discrete control case and a continuous control case), showing that our method compares favorably to several baselines in offline policy learning for industrial process control.

**Abstract:** In the field of natural language processing, sentiment analysis via deep learning has a excellent performance by using large labeled datasets. Meanwhile, labeled data are insufficient in many sentiment analysis, and obtaining these data is time-consuming and laborious. Prompt learning devotes to resolving the data deficiency by reformulating downstream tasks with the help of prompt. In this way, the appropriate prompt is very important for the performance of the model. This paper proposes an adaptive prompting(AP) construction strategy using seq2seq-attention structure to acquire the semantic information of the input sequence. Then dynamically construct adaptive prompt which can not only improve the quality of the prompt, but also can effectively generalize to other fields by pre-trained prompt which is constructed by existing public labeled data. The experimental results on FewCLUE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method AP can effectively construct appropriate adaptive prompt regardless of the quality of hand-crafted prompt and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** In this paper we focus on comparing machine learning approaches for quantum graphs, which are metric graphs, i.e., graphs with dedicated edge lengths, and an associated differential operator. In our case the differential equation is a drift-diffusion model. Computational methods for quantum graphs require a careful discretization of the differential operator that also incorporates the node conditions, in our case Kirchhoff-Neumann conditions. Traditional numerical schemes are rather mature but have to be tailored manually when the differential equation becomes the constraint in an optimization problem. Recently, physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution of partial differential equations from a range of applications. They offer flexibility to solve parameter identification or optimization problems by only slightly changing the problem formulation used for the forward simulation. We compare several PINN approaches for solving the drift-diffusion on the metric graph.

**Abstract:** Increasing concerns about disparate effects of AI have motivated a great deal of work on fair machine learning. Existing works mainly focus on independence- and separation-based measures (e.g., demographic parity, equality of opportunity, equalized odds), while sufficiency-based measures such as predictive parity are much less studied. This paper considers predictive parity, which requires equalizing the probability of success given a positive prediction among different protected groups. We prove that, if the overall performances of different groups vary only moderately, all fair Bayes-optimal classifiers under predictive parity are group-wise thresholding rules. Perhaps surprisingly, this may not hold if group performance levels vary widely; in this case we find that predictive parity among protected groups may lead to within-group unfairness. We then propose an algorithm we call FairBayes-DPP, aiming to ensure predictive parity when our condition is satisfied. FairBayes-DPP is an adaptive thresholding algorithm that aims to achieve predictive parity, while also seeking to maximize test accuracy. We provide supporting experiments conducted on synthetic and empirical data.

**Abstract:** Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs), inspired from the mammalian neocortex, exhibit energy-efficient online sensory processing capabilities. Recent works have proposed a microarchitecture design framework for implementing TNNs and demonstrated competitive performance on vision and time-series applications. Building on them, this work proposes TNN7, a suite of nine highly optimized custom macros developed using a predictive 7nm Process Design Kit (PDK), to enhance the efficiency, modularity and flexibility of the TNN design framework. TNN prototypes for two applications are used for evaluation of TNN7. An unsupervised time-series clustering TNN delivering competitive performance can be implemented within 40 uW power and 0.05 mm^2 area, while a 4-layer TNN that achieves an MNIST error rate of 1% consumes only 18 mW and 24.63 mm^2. On average, the proposed macros reduce power, delay, area, and energy-delay product by 14%, 16%, 28%, and 45%, respectively. Furthermore, employing TNN7 significantly reduces the synthesis runtime of TNN designs (by more than 3x), allowing for highly-scaled TNN implementations to be realized.

**Abstract:** We examine the zero-temperature Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm as a tool for training a neural network by minimizing a loss function. We find that, as expected on theoretical grounds and shown empirically by other authors, Metropolis Monte Carlo can train a neural net with an accuracy comparable to that of gradient descent, if not necessarily as quickly. The Metropolis algorithm does not fail automatically when the number of parameters of a neural network is large. It can fail when a neural network's structure or neuron activations are strongly heterogenous, and we introduce an adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm, aMC, to overcome these limitations. The intrinsic stochasticity of the Monte Carlo method allows aMC to train neural networks in which the gradient is too small to allow training by gradient descent. We suggest that, as for molecular simulation, Monte Carlo methods offer a complement to gradient-based methods for training neural networks, allowing access to a distinct set of network architectures and principles.

**Abstract:** The nearing end of Moore's Law has been driving the development of domain-specific hardware tailored to solve a special set of problems. Along these lines, probabilistic computing with inherently stochastic building blocks (p-bits) have shown significant promise, particularly in the context of hard optimization and statistical sampling problems. p-bits have been proposed and demonstrated in different hardware substrates ranging from small-scale stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (sMTJs) in asynchronous architectures to large-scale CMOS in synchronous architectures. Here, we design and implement a truly asynchronous and medium-scale p-computer (with $\approx$ 800 p-bits) that closely emulates the asynchronous dynamics of sMTJs in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Using hard instances of the planted Ising glass problem on the Chimera lattice, we evaluate the performance of the asynchronous architecture against an ideal, synchronous design that performs parallelized (chromatic) exact Gibbs sampling. We find that despite the lack of any careful synchronization, the asynchronous design achieves parallelism with comparable algorithmic scaling in the ideal, carefully tuned and parallelized synchronous design. Our results highlight the promise of massively scaled p-computers with millions of free-running p-bits made out of nanoscale building blocks such as stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions.

**Abstract:** Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown remarkable learning capabilities when processing graph-structured data found inherently in many application areas. GCNs distribute the outputs of neural networks embedded in each vertex over multiple iterations to take advantage of the relations captured by the underlying graphs. Consequently, they incur a significant amount of computation and irregular communication overheads, which call for GCN-specific hardware accelerators. To this end, this paper presents a communication-aware in-memory computing architecture (COIN) for GCN hardware acceleration. Besides accelerating the computation using custom compute elements (CE) and in-memory computing, COIN aims at minimizing the intra- and inter-CE communication in GCN operations to optimize the performance and energy efficiency. Experimental evaluations with widely used datasets show up to 105x improvement in energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art GCN accelerator.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models are prone to overfitting their source (training) distributions, which is commonly believed to be why they falter in novel target domains. Here we examine the contrasting view that multi-source domain generalization (DG) is in fact a problem of mitigating source domain underfitting: models not adequately learning the signal in their multi-domain training data. Experiments on a reading comprehension DG benchmark show that as a model gradually learns its source domains better -- using known methods such as knowledge distillation from a larger model -- its zero-shot out-of-domain accuracy improves at an even faster rate. Improved source domain learning also demonstrates superior generalization over three popular domain-invariant learning methods that aim to counter overfitting.

**Abstract:** Most machine learning (ML) models are developed for prediction only; offering no option for causal interpretation of their predictions or parameters/properties. This can hamper the health systems' ability to employ ML models in clinical decision-making processes, where the need and desire for predicting outcomes under hypothetical investigations (i.e., counterfactual reasoning/explanation) is high. In this research, we introduce a new representation learning framework (i.e., partial concept bottleneck), which considers the provision of counterfactual explanations as an embedded property of the risk model. Despite architectural changes necessary for jointly optimising for prediction accuracy and counterfactual reasoning, the accuracy of our approach is comparable to prediction-only models. Our results suggest that our proposed framework has the potential to help researchers and clinicians improve personalised care (e.g., by investigating the hypothetical differential effects of interventions)

**Abstract:** Low Earth Obit (LEO) satellite constellations have seen a sharp increase of deployment in recent years, due to their distinctive capabilities of providing broadband Internet access and enabling global data acquisition as well as large-scale AI applications. To apply machine learning (ML) in such applications, the traditional way of downloading satellite data such as imagery to a ground station (GS) and then training a model in a centralized manner, is not desirable because of the limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity between satellites and the GS, and privacy concerns on transmitting raw data. Federated Learning (FL) as an emerging communication and computing paradigm provides a potentially supreme solution to this problem. However, we show that existing FL solutions do not fit well in such LEO constellation scenarios because of significant challenges such as excessive convergence delay and unreliable wireless channels. To this end, we propose to introduce high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers (PSs) and propose a synchronous FL algorithm, FedHAP, to accomplish model training in an efficient manner via inter-satellite collaboration. To accelerate convergence, we also propose a layered communication scheme between satellites and HAPs that FedHAP leverages. Our simulations demonstrate that FedHAP attains model convergence in much fewer communication rounds than benchmarks, cutting the training time substantially from several days down to a few hours with the same level of resulting accuracy.

**Abstract:** Compressive sensing (CS) based computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction aims at reducing the radiation risk through sparse-view projection data. It is usually challenging to achieve satisfying image quality from incomplete projections. Recently, the nonconvex ${L_ {1/2}} $-norm has achieved promising performance in sparse recovery, while the applications on imaging are unsatisfactory due to its nonconvexity. In this paper, we develop a ${L_ {1/2}} $-regularized nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) denoiser for CT reconstruction problem, which integrates low-rank approximation with group sparse coding (GSC) framework. Concretely, we first split the CT reconstruction problem into two subproblems, and then improve the CT image quality furtherly using our ${L_ {1/2}} $-regularized NSS denoiser. Instead of optimizing the nonconvex problem under the perspective of GSC, we particularly reconstruct CT image via low-rank minimization based on two simple yet essential schemes, which build the equivalent relationship between GSC based denoiser and low-rank minimization. Furtherly, the weighted singular value thresholding (WSVT) operator is utilized to optimize the resulting nonconvex ${L_ {1/2}} $ minimization problem. Following this, our proposed denoiser is integrated with the CT reconstruction problem by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive experimental results on typical clinical CT images have demonstrated that our approach can further achieve better performance than popular approaches.
