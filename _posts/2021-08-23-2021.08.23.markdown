**Abstract:** Image restoration is a long-standing low-level vision problem that aims to restore high-quality images from low-quality images (e.g., downscaled, noisy and compressed images). While state-of-the-art image restoration methods are based on convolutional neural networks, few attempts have been made with Transformers which show impressive performance on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline model SwinIR for image restoration based on the Swin Transformer. SwinIR consists of three parts: shallow feature extraction, deep feature extraction and high-quality image reconstruction. In particular, the deep feature extraction module is composed of several residual Swin Transformer blocks (RSTB), each of which has several Swin Transformer layers together with a residual connection. We conduct experiments on three representative tasks: image super-resolution (including classical, lightweight and real-world image super-resolution), image denoising (including grayscale and color image denoising) and JPEG compression artifact reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on different tasks by $\textbf{up to 0.14$\sim$0.45dB}$, while the total number of parameters can be reduced by $\textbf{up to 67%}$.

**Abstract:** Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural textto-speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle and often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading to missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive endto-end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper we leverage the alignment mechanism proposed in RAD-TTS as a generic alignment learning framework, easily applicable to a variety of neural TTS models. The framework combines forward-sum algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and a simple and efficient static prior. In our experiments, the alignment learning framework improves all tested TTS architectures, both autoregressive (Flowtron, Tacotron 2) and non-autoregressive (FastPitch, FastSpeech 2, RAD-TTS). Specifically, it improves alignment convergence speed of existing attention-based mechanisms, simplifies the training pipeline, and makes the models more robust to errors on long utterances. Most importantly, the framework improves the perceived speech synthesis quality, as judged by human evaluators.

**Abstract:** We present ComSum, a data set of 7 million commit messages for text summarization. When documenting commits, software code changes, both a message and its summary are posted. We gather and filter those to curate developers' work summarization data set. Along with its growing size, practicality and challenging language domain, the data set benefits from the living field of empirical software engineering. As commits follow a typology, we propose to not only evaluate outputs by Rouge, but by their meaning preservation.

**Abstract:** The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the amount of mis- and disinformation online, from targeted disinformation campaigns to influence politics, to the unintentional spreading of misinformation about public health. This development has spurred research in the area of automatic fact checking, from approaches to detect check-worthy claims and determining the stance of tweets towards claims, to methods to determine the veracity of claims given evidence documents. These automatic methods are often content-based, using natural language processing methods, which in turn utilise deep neural networks to learn higher-order features from text in order to make predictions. As deep neural networks are black-box models, their inner workings cannot be easily explained. At the same time, it is desirable to explain how they arrive at certain decisions, especially if they are to be used for decision making. While this has been known for some time, the issues this raises have been exacerbated by models increasing in size, and by EU legislation requiring models to be used for decision making to provide explanations, and, very recently, by legislation requiring online platforms operating in the EU to provide transparent reporting on their services. Despite this, current solutions for explainability are still lacking in the area of fact checking. This thesis presents my research on automatic fact checking, including claim check-worthiness detection, stance detection and veracity prediction. Its contributions go beyond fact checking, with the thesis proposing more general machine learning solutions for natural language processing in the area of learning with limited labelled data. Finally, the thesis presents some first solutions for explainable fact checking.

**Abstract:** Classic image scaling (e.g. bicubic) can be seen as one convolutional layer and a single upscaling filter. Its implementation is ubiquitous in all display devices and image processing software. In the last decade deep learning systems have been introduced for the task of image super-resolution (SR), using several convolutional layers and numerous filters. These methods have taken over the benchmarks of image quality for upscaling tasks. Would it be possible to replace classic upscalers with deep learning architectures on edge devices such as display panels, tablets, laptop computers, etc.? On one hand, the current trend in Edge-AI chips shows a promising future in this direction, with rapid development of hardware that can run deep-learning tasks efficiently. On the other hand, in image SR only few architectures have pushed the limit to extreme small sizes that can actually run on edge devices at real-time. We explore possible solutions to this problem with the aim to fill the gap between classic upscalers and small deep learning configurations. As a transition from classic to deep-learning upscaling we propose edge-SR (eSR), a set of one-layer architectures that use interpretable mechanisms to upscale images. Certainly, a one-layer architecture cannot reach the quality of deep learning systems. Nevertheless, we find that for high speed requirements, eSR becomes better at trading-off image quality and runtime performance. Filling the gap between classic and deep-learning architectures for image upscaling is critical for massive adoption of this technology. It is equally important to have an interpretable system that can reveal the inner strategies to solve this problem and guide us to future improvements and better understanding of larger networks.

**Abstract:** Isaac Gym offers a high performance learning platform to train policies for wide variety of robotics tasks directly on GPU. Both physics simulation and the neural network policy training reside on GPU and communicate by directly passing data from physics buffers to PyTorch tensors without ever going through any CPU bottlenecks. This leads to blazing fast training times for complex robotics tasks on a single GPU with 2-3 orders of magnitude improvements compared to conventional RL training that uses a CPU based simulator and GPU for neural networks.

**Abstract:** Recovering high-quality 3D human motion in complex scenes from monocular videos is important for many applications, ranging from AR/VR to robotics. However, capturing realistic human-scene interactions, while dealing with occlusions and partial views, is challenging; current approaches are still far from achieving compelling results. We address this problem by proposing LEMO: LEarning human MOtion priors for 4D human body capture. By leveraging the large-scale motion capture dataset AMASS, we introduce a novel motion smoothness prior, which strongly reduces the jitters exhibited by poses recovered over a sequence. Furthermore, to handle contacts and occlusions occurring frequently in body-scene interactions, we design a contact friction term and a contact-aware motion infiller obtained via per-instance self-supervised training. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed motion priors, we combine them into a novel pipeline for 4D human body capture in 3D scenes. With our pipeline, we demonstrate high-quality 4D human body capture, reconstructing smooth motions and physically plausible body-scene interactions. The code and data are available at https://sanweiliti.github.io/LEMO/LEMO.html.

**Abstract:** To make advanced learning machines such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) more transparent in decision making, explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide interpretations of DNNs' predictions. These interpretations are usually given in the form of heatmaps, each one illustrating relevant patterns regarding the prediction for a given instance. Bayesian approaches such as Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) so far have a limited form of transparency (model transparency) already built-in through their prior weight distribution, but notably, they lack explanations of their predictions for given instances. In this work, we bring together these two perspectives of transparency into a holistic explanation framework for explaining BNNs. Within the Bayesian framework, the network weights follow a probability distribution. Hence, the standard (deterministic) prediction strategy of DNNs extends in BNNs to a predictive distribution, and thus the standard explanation extends to an explanation distribution. Exploiting this view, we uncover that BNNs implicitly employ multiple heterogeneous prediction strategies. While some of these are inherited from standard DNNs, others are revealed to us by considering the inherent uncertainty in BNNs. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments on toy/benchmark data and real-world data from pathology show that the proposed approach of explaining BNNs can lead to more effective and insightful explanations.

**Abstract:** Language models (LM) have grown with non-stop in the last decade, from sequence-to-sequence architectures to the state-of-the-art and utter attention-based Transformers. In this work, we demonstrate how the inclusion of deep generative models within BERT can bring more versatile models, able to impute missing/noisy words with richer text or even improve BLEU score. More precisely, we use a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) as a regularizer layer and prove its effectiveness not only in Transformers but also in the most relevant encoder-decoder based LM, seq2seq with and without attention.

**Abstract:** Practical recommender systems experience a cold-start problem when observed user-item interactions in the history are insufficient. Meta learning, especially gradient based one, can be adopted to tackle this problem by learning initial parameters of the model and thus allowing fast adaptation to a specific task from limited data examples. Though with significant performance improvement, it commonly suffers from two critical issues: the non-compatibility with mainstream industrial deployment and the heavy computational burdens, both due to the inner-loop gradient operation. These two issues make them hard to be applied in practical recommender systems. To enjoy the benefits of meta learning framework and mitigate these problems, we propose a recommendation framework called Contextual Modulation Meta Learning (CMML). CMML is composed of fully feed-forward operations so it is computationally efficient and completely compatible with the mainstream industrial deployment. CMML consists of three components, including a context encoder that can generate context embedding to represent a specific task, a hybrid context generator that aggregates specific user-item features with task-level context, and a contextual modulation network, which can modulate the recommendation model to adapt effectively. We validate our approach on both scenario-specific and user-specific cold-start setting on various real-world datasets, showing CMML can achieve comparable or even better performance with gradient based methods yet with much higher computational efficiency and better interpretability.

**Abstract:** Learning deeper models is usually a simple and effective approach to improve model performance, but deeper models have larger model parameters and are more difficult to train. To get a deeper model, simply stacking more layers of the model seems to work well, but previous works have claimed that it cannot benefit the model. We propose to train a deeper model with recurrent mechanism, which loops the encoder and decoder blocks of Transformer in the depth direction. To address the increasing of model parameters, we choose to share parameters in different recursive moments. We conduct our experiments on WMT16 English-to-German and WMT14 English-to-France translation tasks, our model outperforms the shallow Transformer-Base/Big baseline by 0.35, 1.45 BLEU points, which is 27.23% of Transformer-Big model parameters. Compared to the deep Transformer(20-layer encoder, 6-layer decoder), our model has similar model performance and infer speed, but our model parameters are 54.72% of the former.

**Abstract:** This paper presents an innovative deep learning pipeline which estimates the relative pose of a spacecraft by incorporating the temporal information from a rendezvous sequence. It leverages the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) units in modelling sequences of data for the processing of features extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. Three distinct training strategies, which follow a coarse-to-fine funnelled approach, are combined to facilitate feature learning and improve end-to-end pose estimation by regression. The capability of CNNs to autonomously ascertain feature representations from images is exploited to fuse thermal infrared data with red-green-blue (RGB) inputs, thus mitigating the effects of artefacts from imaging space objects in the visible wavelength. Each contribution of the proposed framework, dubbed ChiNet, is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, and the complete pipeline is validated on experimental data.

**Abstract:** The increasing size of data generated by smartphones and IoT devices motivated the development of Federated Learning (FL), a framework for on-device collaborative training of machine learning models. First efforts in FL focused on learning a single global model with good average performance across clients, but the global model may be arbitrarily bad for a given client, due to the inherent heterogeneity of local data distributions. Federated multi-task learning (MTL) approaches can learn personalized models by formulating an opportune penalized optimization problem. The penalization term can capture complex relations among personalized models, but eschews clear statistical assumptions about local data distributions. In this work, we propose to study federated MTL under the flexible assumption that each local data distribution is a mixture of unknown underlying distributions. This assumption encompasses most of the existing personalized FL approaches and leads to federated EM-like algorithms for both client-server and fully decentralized settings. Moreover, it provides a principled way to serve personalized models to clients not seen at training time. The algorithms' convergence is analyzed through a novel federated surrogate optimization framework, which can be of general interest. Experimental results on FL benchmarks show that our approach provides models with higher accuracy and fairness than state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Accelerating deep neural network (DNN) inference on resource-limited devices is one of the most important barriers to ensuring a wider and more inclusive adoption. To alleviate this, DNN binary quantization for faster convolution and memory savings is one of the most promising strategies despite its serious drop in accuracy. The present paper therefore proposes a novel binary quantization function based on quantized compressed sensing (QCS). Theoretical arguments conjecture that our proposal preserves the practical benefits of standard methods, while reducing the quantization error and the resulting drop in accuracy.

**Abstract:** Today, according to the Cisco Annual Internet Report (2018-2023), the fastest-growing category of Internet traffic is machine-to-machine communication. In particular, machine-to-machine communication of images and videos represents a new challenge and opens up new perspectives in the context of data compression. One possible solution approach consists of adapting current human-targeted image and video coding standards to the use case of machine consumption. Another approach consists of developing completely new compression paradigms and architectures for machine-to-machine communications. In this paper, we focus on image compression and present an inference-time content-adaptive finetuning scheme that optimizes the latent representation of an end-to-end learned image codec, aimed at improving the compression efficiency for machine-consumption. The conducted experiments show that our online finetuning brings an average bitrate saving (BD-rate) of -3.66% with respect to our pretrained image codec. In particular, at low bitrate points, our proposed method results in a significant bitrate saving of -9.85%. Overall, our pretrained-and-then-finetuned system achieves -30.54% BD-rate over the state-of-the-art image/video codec Versatile Video Coding (VVC).

**Abstract:** Multimodal learning has achieved great successes in many scenarios. Compared with unimodal learning, it can effectively combine the information from different modalities to improve the performance of learning tasks. In reality, the multimodal data may have missing modalities due to various reasons, such as sensor failure and data transmission error. In previous works, the information of the modality-missing data has not been well exploited. To address this problem, we propose an efficient approach based on maximum likelihood estimation to incorporate the knowledge in the modality-missing data. Specifically, we design a likelihood function to characterize the conditional distribution of the modality-complete data and the modality-missing data, which is theoretically optimal. Moreover, we develop a generalized form of the softmax function to effectively implement maximum likelihood estimation in an end-to-end manner. Such training strategy guarantees the computability of our algorithm capably. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments on real-world multimodal datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, even when 95% of the training data has missing modality.

**Abstract:** We propose a general formulation for stochastic treatment recommendation problems in settings with clinical survival data, which we call the Deep Survival Dose Response Function (DeepSDRF). That is, we consider the problem of learning the conditional average dose response (CADR) function solely from historical data in which unobserved factors (confounders) affect both observed treatment and time-to-event outcomes. The estimated treatment effect from DeepSDRF enables us to develop recommender algorithms with explanatory insights. We compared two recommender approaches based on random search and reinforcement learning and found similar performance in terms of patient outcome. We tested the DeepSDRF and the corresponding recommender on extensive simulation studies and two empirical databases: 1) the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and 2) the eICU Research Institute (eRI) database. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that confounders are taken into consideration for addressing the stochastic treatment effect with observational data in a medical context.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a generative AI model for automated music composition with LSTM networks that takes a novel approach at encoding musical information which is based on movement in music rather than absolute pitch. Melodies are encoded as a series of intervals rather than a series of pitches, and chords are encoded as the set of intervals that each chord note makes with the melody at each timestep. Experimental results show promise as they sound musical and tonal. There are also weaknesses to this method, mainly excessive modulations in the compositions, but that is expected from the nature of the encoding. This issue is discussed later in the paper and is a potential topic for future work.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), which aims to separate an underlying low-multilinear-rank tensor and a sparse outlier tensor from their sum. In this work, we propose a fast non-convex algorithm, coined Robust Tensor CUR (RTCUR), for large-scale TRPCA problems. RTCUR considers a framework of alternating projections and utilizes the recently developed tensor Fiber CUR decomposition to dramatically lower the computational complexity. The performance advantage of RTCUR is empirically verified against the state-of-the-arts on the synthetic datasets and is further demonstrated on the real-world application such as color video background subtraction.

This solution can be run in real-time at the edge, achieving efficient inference in a low-powered IoT environment while also being able to track multiple different vessels.

**Abstract:** In a recent joint work, the author has developed a modification of Newton's method, named New Q-Newton's method, which can avoid saddle points and has quadratic rate of convergence. While good theoretical convergence guarantee has not been established for this method, experiments on small scale problems show that the method works very competitively against other well known modifications of Newton's method such as Adaptive Cubic Regularization and BFGS, as well as first order methods such as Unbounded Two-way Backtracking Gradient Descent.
  In this paper, we resolve the convergence guarantee issue by proposing a modification of New Q-Newton's method, named New Q-Newton's method Backtracking, which incorporates a more sophisticated use of hyperparameters and a Backtracking line search. This new method has very good theoretical guarantees, which for a {\bf Morse function} yields the following (which is unknown for New Q-Newton's method):
  {\bf Theorem.} Let $f:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function, that is all its critical points have invertible Hessian. Then for a sequence $\{x_n\}$ constructed by New Q-Newton's method Backtracking from a random initial point $x_0$, we have the following two alternatives:
  i) $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}||x_n||=\infty$,
  or
  ii) $\{x_n\}$ converges to a point $x_{\infty}$ which is a {\bf local minimum} of $f$, and the rate of convergence is {\bf quadratic}.
  Moreover, if $f$ has compact sublevels, then only case ii) happens.
  As far as we know, for Morse functions, this is the best theoretical guarantee for iterative optimization algorithms so far in the literature. We have tested in experiments on small scale, with some further simplified versions of New Q-Newton's method Backtracking, and found that the new method significantly improve New Q-Newton's method.

**Abstract:** In recent years, inductive graph embedding models, \emph{viz.}, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly accurate at link prediction (LP) in online social networks. The performance of such networks depends strongly on the input node features, which vary across networks and applications. Selecting appropriate node features remains application-dependent and generally an open question. Moreover, owing to privacy and ethical issues, use of personalized node features is often restricted. In fact, many publicly available data from online social network do not contain any node features (e.g., demography). In this work, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis which shows that harnessing a transductive technique (e.g., Node2Vec) for obtaining initial node representations, after which an inductive node embedding technique takes over, leads to substantial improvements in link prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that, for a wide variety of GNN variants, node representation vectors obtained from Node2Vec serve as high quality input features to GNNs, thereby improving LP performance.

**Abstract:** The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents unique and unknown problem complexities and modeling challenges, where an imperative task is to model both its process and data uncertainties, represented in implicit and high-proportional undocumented infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even more phenomenal in the overwhelming mutation-dominated resurgences with vaccinated but still susceptible populations. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach to (1) characterizing and distinguishing Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections by expanding the foundational compartmental epidemic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with two compartments, resulting in a new Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model; (2) characterizing the probabilistic density of infections by empowering SUDR to capture exogenous processes like clustering contagion interactions, superspreading and social reinforcement; and (3) approximating the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during the COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. We solve the modeling by sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, making SUDR suitable to handle the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks often make decisions based on the spurious correlations inherent in the dataset, failing to generalize in an unbiased data distribution. Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias to prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real dataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored augmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation without requiring supervision on the bias type. Assuming that the bias corresponds to the easy-to-learn attributes, we sort the training images based on how much a biased classifier can exploits them as shortcut and divide them into bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner. Afterwards, we integrate the style-transferring module of the image translation model with the class activation maps of such biased classifier, which enables to primarily transfer the bias attributes learned by the classifier. Therefore, given the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, BiaSwap generates the bias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary images, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. Given such augmented images, BiaSwap demonstrates the superiority in debiasing against the existing baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets. Even without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable performance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved generalization capability of the model.

**Abstract:** Over recent years, deep learning-based computer vision systems have been applied to images at an ever-increasing pace, oftentimes representing the only type of consumption for those images. Given the dramatic explosion in the number of images generated per day, a question arises: how much better would an image codec targeting machine-consumption perform against state-of-the-art codecs targeting human-consumption? In this paper, we propose an image codec for machines which is neural network (NN) based and end-to-end learned. In particular, we propose a set of training strategies that address the delicate problem of balancing competing loss functions, such as computer vision task losses, image distortion losses, and rate loss. Our experimental results show that our NN-based codec outperforms the state-of-the-art Versa-tile Video Coding (VVC) standard on the object detection and instance segmentation tasks, achieving -37.87% and -32.90% of BD-rate gain, respectively, while being fast thanks to its compact size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end learned machine-targeted image codec.

**Abstract:** There are essentially three kinds of approaches to Uncertainty Quantification (UQ): (A) robust optimization, (B) Bayesian, (C) decision theory. Although (A) is robust, it is unfavorable with respect to accuracy and data assimilation. (B) requires a prior, it is generally brittle and posterior estimations can be slow. Although (C) leads to the identification of an optimal prior, its approximation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the notion of risk is one that is averaged with respect to the distribution of the data. We introduce a 4th kind which is a hybrid between (A), (B), (C), and hypothesis testing. It can be summarized as, after observing a sample $x$, (1) defining a likelihood region through the relative likelihood and (2) playing a minmax game in that region to define optimal estimators and their risk. The resulting method has several desirable properties (a) an optimal prior is identified after measuring the data, and the notion of risk is a posterior one, (b) the determination of the optimal estimate and its risk can be reduced to computing the minimum enclosing ball of the image of the likelihood region under the quantity of interest map (which is fast and not subject to the curse of dimensionality). The method is characterized by a parameter in $ [0,1]$ acting as an assumed lower bound on the rarity of the observed data (the relative likelihood). When that parameter is near $1$, the method produces a posterior distribution concentrated around a maximum likelihood estimate with tight but low confidence UQ estimates. When that parameter is near $0$, the method produces a maximal risk posterior distribution with high confidence UQ estimates. In addition to navigating the accuracy-uncertainty tradeoff, the proposed method addresses the brittleness of Bayesian inference by navigating the robustness-accuracy tradeoff associated with data assimilation.

**Abstract:** Deep learning has become an integral part of various computer vision systems in recent years due to its outstanding achievements for object recognition, facial recognition, and scene understanding. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to be fooled with nearly high confidence by an adversary. In practice, the vulnerability of deep learning systems against carefully perturbed images, known as adversarial examples, poses a dire security threat in the physical world applications. To address this phenomenon, we present, what to our knowledge, is the first ever image set based adversarial defence approach. Image set classification has shown an exceptional performance for object and face recognition, owing to its intrinsic property of handling appearance variability. We propose a robust deep Bayesian image set classification as a defence framework against a broad range of adversarial attacks. We extensively experiment the performance of the proposed technique with several voting strategies. We further analyse the effects of image size, perturbation magnitude, along with the ratio of perturbed images in each image set. We also evaluate our technique with the recent state-of-the-art defence methods, and single-shot recognition task. The empirical results demonstrate superior performance on CIFAR-10, MNIST, ETH-80, and Tiny ImageNet datasets.

**Abstract:** Despite the tremendous progress recently made towards automatic sleep staging in adults, it is currently known if the most advanced algorithms generalize to the pediatric population, which displays distinctive characteristics in overnight polysomnography (PSG). To answer the question, in this work, we conduct a large-scale comparative study on the state-of-the-art deep learning methods for pediatric automatic sleep staging. A selection of six different deep neural networks with diverging features are adopted to evaluate a sample of more than 1,200 children across a wide spectrum of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity. Our experimental results show that the performance of automated pediatric sleep staging when evaluated on new subjects is equivalent to the expert-level one reported on adults, reaching an overall accuracy of 87.0%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.829, and a macro F1-score of 83.5% in case of single-channel EEG. The performance is further improved when dual-channel EEG$\cdot$EOG are used, reaching an accuracy of 88.2%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.844, and a macro F1-score of 85.1%. The results also show that the studied algorithms are robust to concept drift when the training and test data were recorded 7-months apart. Detailed analyses further demonstrate "almost perfect" agreement between the automatic scorers to one another and their similar behavioral patterns on the staging errors.

**Abstract:** Automating physical database design has remained a long-term interest in database research due to substantial performance gains afforded by optimised structures. Despite significant progress, a majority of today's commercial solutions are highly manual, requiring offline invocation by database administrators (DBAs) who are expected to identify and supply representative training workloads. Even the latest advancements like query stores provide only limited support for dynamic environments. This status quo is untenable: identifying representative static workloads is no longer realistic; and physical design tools remain susceptible to the query optimiser's cost misestimates. Furthermore, modern application environments such as hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems render analytical modelling next to impossible.
  We propose a self-driving approach to online index selection that eschews the DBA and query optimiser, and instead learns the benefits of viable structures through strategic exploration and direct performance observation. We view the problem as one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, specifically within the bandit learning setting. Multi-armed bandits balance exploration and exploitation to provably guarantee average performance that converges to policies that are optimal with perfect hindsight. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation against a state-of-the-art commercial tuning tool demonstrates up to 75% speed-up on shifting and ad-hoc workloads and up to 28% speed-up on static workloads in analytical processing environments. In HTAP environments, our solution provides up to 59% speed-up on shifting and 51% speed-up on static workloads. Furthermore, our bandit framework outperforms deep reinforcement learning (RL) in terms of convergence speed and performance volatility (providing up to 58% speed-up).

**Abstract:** Due to the rapid increase in the diversity of image data, the problem of domain generalization has received increased attention recently. While domain generalization is a challenging problem, it has achieved great development thanks to the fast development of AI techniques in computer vision. Most of these advanced algorithms are proposed with deep architectures based on convolution neural nets (CNN). However, though CNNs have a strong ability to find the discriminative features, they do a poor job of modeling the relations between different locations in the image due to the response to CNN filters are mostly local. Since these local and global spatial relationships are characterized to distinguish an object under consideration, they play a critical role in improving the generalization ability against the domain gap. In order to get the object parts relationships to gain better domain generalization, this work proposes to use the self attention model. However, the attention models are proposed for sequence, which are not expert in discriminate feature extraction for 2D images. Considering this, we proposed a hybrid architecture to discover the spatial relationships between these local features, and derive a composite representation that encodes both the discriminative features and their relationships to improve the domain generalization. Evaluation on three well-known benchmarks demonstrates the benefits of modeling relationships between the features of an image using the proposed method and achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance. More specifically, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.2% and 3.4% on PACS and Office-Home databases, respectively.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a deep relational metric learning (DRML) framework for image clustering and retrieval. Most existing deep metric learning methods learn an embedding space with a general objective of increasing interclass distances and decreasing intraclass distances. However, the conventional losses of metric learning usually suppress intraclass variations which might be helpful to identify samples of unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose to adaptively learn an ensemble of features that characterizes an image from different aspects to model both interclass and intraclass distributions. We further employ a relational module to capture the correlations among each feature in the ensemble and construct a graph to represent an image. We then perform relational inference on the graph to integrate the ensemble and obtain a relation-aware embedding to measure the similarities. Extensive experiments on the widely-used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets demonstrate that our framework improves existing deep metric learning methods and achieves very competitive results.

Researchers tackle these issues by introducing fairness metrics, or federated learning, or differential privacy. A first, this work presents an ethical federated learning model, incorporating all three measures simultaneously. Experiments on the Adult, Bank and Dutch datasets highlight the resulting ``empirical interplay" between accuracy, fairness, and privacy.

**Abstract:** This work investigates how to identify the source of impulsive noise events using a pair of wireless noise sensors. One sensor is placed at a known noise source, and another sensor is placed at the noise receiver. Machine learning models receive data from the two sensors and estimate whether a given noise event originates from the known noise source or another source. To avoid privacy issues, the approach uses on-edge preprocessing that converts the sound into privacy compatible spectrograms. The system was evaluated at a shooting range and explosives training facility, using data collected during noise emission testing. The combination of convolutional neural networks with cross-correlation achieved the best results. We created multiple alternative models using different spectrogram representations. The best model detected 70.8\% of the impulsive noise events and correctly predicted 90.3\% of the noise events in the optimal trade-off between recall and precision.

**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) are becoming a preferred model for data processing on irregular domains, yet their analysis and principles of operation are rarely examined due to the black box nature of NNs. To this end, we revisit the operation of GCNNs and show that their convolution layers effectively perform matched filtering of input data with the chosen patterns (features). This allows us to provide a unifying account of GCNNs through a matched filter perspective, whereby the nonlinear ReLU and max-pooling layers are also discussed within the matched filtering framework. This is followed by a step-by-step guide on information propagation and learning in GCNNs. It is also shown that standard CNNs and fully connected NNs can be obtained as a special case of GCNNs. A carefully chosen numerical example guides the reader through the various steps of GCNN operation and learning both visually and numerically.

**Abstract:** "Is it possible to predict expression levels of different genes at a given spatial location in the routine histology image of a tumor section by modeling its stain absorption characteristics?" In this work, we propose a "stain-aware" machine learning approach for prediction of spatial transcriptomic gene expression profiles using digital pathology image of a routine Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) histology section. Unlike recent deep learning methods which are used for gene expression prediction, our proposed approach termed Neural Stain Learning (NSL) explicitly models the association of stain absorption characteristics of the tissue with gene expression patterns in spatial transcriptomics by learning a problem-specific stain deconvolution matrix in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method with only 11 trainable weight parameters outperforms both classical regression models with cellular composition and morphological features as well as deep learning methods. We have found that the gene expression predictions from the proposed approach show higher correlations with true expression values obtained through sequencing for a larger set of genes in comparison to other approaches.

**Abstract:** Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for practical applications like chemistry and materials science on near-term quantum computers as they typically reduce quantum resource requirements. However, in order to implement VQAs, an efficient classical optimization strategy is required. Here we present a new stochastic gradient descent method using an adaptive number of shots at each step, called the global Coupled Adaptive Number of Shots (gCANS) method, which improves on prior art in both the number of iterations as well as the number of shots required. These improvements reduce both the time and money required to run VQAs on current cloud platforms. We analytically prove that in a convex setting gCANS achieves geometric convergence to the optimum. Further, we numerically investigate the performance of gCANS on some chemical configuration problems. We also consider finding the ground state for an Ising model with different numbers of spins to examine the scaling of the method. We find that for these problems, gCANS compares favorably to all of the other optimizers we consider.

**Abstract:** In recent years, filterbank learning has become an increasingly popular strategy for various audio-related machine learning tasks. This is partly due to its ability to discover task-specific audio characteristics which can be leveraged in downstream processing. It is also a natural extension of the nearly ubiquitous deep learning methods employed to tackle a diverse array of audio applications. In this work, several variations of a frontend filterbank learning module are investigated for piano transcription, a challenging low-level music information retrieval task. We build upon a standard piano transcription model, modifying only the feature extraction stage. The filterbank module is designed such that its complex filters are unconstrained 1D convolutional kernels with long receptive fields. Additional variations employ the Hilbert transform to render the filters intrinsically analytic and apply variational dropout to promote filterbank sparsity. Transcription results are compared across all experiments, and we offer visualization and analysis of the filterbanks.

**Abstract:** A structured variable selection problem is considered in which the covariates, divided into predefined groups, activate according to sparse patterns with few nonzero entries per group. Capitalizing on the concept of atomic norm, a composite norm can be properly designed to promote such exclusive group sparsity patterns. The resulting norm lends itself to efficient and flexible regularized optimization algorithms for support recovery, like the proximal algorithm. Moreover, an active set algorithm is proposed that builds the solution by successively including structure atoms into the estimated support. It is also shown that such an algorithm can be tailored to match more rigid structures than plain exclusive group sparsity. Asymptotic consistency analysis (with both the number of parameters as well as the number of groups growing with the observation size) establishes the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of signed support recovery under conventional assumptions. Finally, a set of numerical simulations further corroborates the results.

**Abstract:** Deep learning (DL) models are widely used to provide a more convenient and smarter life. However, biased algorithms will negatively influence us. For instance, groups targeted by biased algorithms will feel unfairly treated and even fearful of negative consequences of these biases. This work targets biased generative models' behaviors, identifying the cause of the biases and eliminating them. We can (as expected) conclude that biased data causes biased predictions of face frontalization models. Varying the proportions of male and female faces in the training data can have a substantial effect on behavior on the test data: we found that the seemingly obvious choice of 50:50 proportions was not the best for this dataset to reduce biased behavior on female faces, which was 71% unbiased as compared to our top unbiased rate of 84%. Failure in generation and generating incorrect gender faces are two behaviors of these models. In addition, only some layers in face frontalization models are vulnerable to biased datasets. Optimizing the skip-connections of the generator in face frontalization models can make models less biased. We conclude that it is likely to be impossible to eliminate all training bias without an unlimited size dataset, and our experiments show that the bias can be reduced and quantified. We believe the next best to a perfect unbiased predictor is one that has minimized the remaining known bias.

**Abstract:** We propose an information-fusion approach based on belief functions to combine convolutional neural networks. In this approach, several pre-trained DS-based CNN architectures extract features from input images and convert them into mass functions on different frames of discernment. A fusion module then aggregates these mass functions using Dempster's rule. An end-to-end learning procedure allows us to fine-tune the overall architecture using a learning set with soft labels, which further improves the classification performance. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated experimentally using three benchmark databases.

**Abstract:** Low-tubal-rank tensor approximation has been proposed to analyze large-scale and multi-dimensional data. However, finding such an accurate approximation is challenging in the streaming setting, due to the limited computational resources. To alleviate this issue, this paper extends a popular matrix sketching technique, namely Frequent Directions, for constructing an efficient and accurate low-tubal-rank tensor approximation from streaming data based on the tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, the new algorithm allows the tensor data to be observed slice by slice, but only needs to maintain and incrementally update a much smaller sketch which could capture the principal information of the original tensor. The rigorous theoretical analysis shows that the approximation error of the new algorithm can be arbitrarily small when the sketch size grows linearly. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real multi-dimensional data further reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other sketching algorithms for getting low-tubal-rank approximation, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

**Abstract:** Accurate detection of a drivers attention state can help develop assistive technologies that respond to unexpected hazards in real time and therefore improve road safety. This study compares the performance of several attention classifiers trained on participants brain activity. Participants performed a driving task in an immersive simulator where the car randomly deviated from the cruising lane. They had to correct the deviation and their response time was considered as an indicator of attention level. Participants repeated the task in two sessions; in one session they received kinesthetic feedback and in another session no feedback. Using their EEG signals, we trained three attention classifiers; a support vector machine (SVM) using EEG spectral band powers, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using either spectral features or the raw EEG data. Our results indicated that the CNN model trained on raw EEG data obtained under kinesthetic feedback achieved the highest accuracy (89%). While using a participants own brain activity to train the model resulted in the best performances, inter-subject transfer learning still performed high (75%), showing promise for calibration-free Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Our findings show that CNN and raw EEG signals can be employed for effective training of a passive BCI for real-time attention classification.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial images, while their robustness in text classification is rarely studied. Several lines of text attack methods have been proposed in the literature, including character-level, word-level, and sentence-level attacks. However, it is still a challenge to minimize the number of word changes necessary to induce misclassification, while simultaneously ensuring lexical correctness, syntactic soundness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose a Bigram and Unigram based adaptive Semantic Preservation Optimization (BU-SPO) method to examine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has four major merits. Firstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level but also at the bigram level which better keeps semantics and avoids producing meaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input words with options among both their synonyms candidates and sememe candidates, which greatly enriches the potential substitutions compared to only using synonyms. Thirdly, we design an optimization algorithm, i.e., Semantic Preservation Optimization (SPO), to determine the priority of word replacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost. Finally, we further improve the SPO with a semantic Filter (named SPOF) to find the adversarial example with the highest semantic similarity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our BU-SPO and BU-SPOF on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by attacking four popular DNNs models. Results show that our methods achieve the highest attack success rates and semantics rates by changing the smallest number of words compared with existing methods.

**Abstract:** Recent advances have been made in applying convolutional neural networks to achieve more precise prediction results for medical image segmentation problems. However, the success of existing methods has highly relied on huge computational complexity and massive storage, which is impractical in the real-world scenario. To deal with this problem, we propose an efficient architecture by distilling knowledge from well-trained medical image segmentation networks to train another lightweight network. This architecture empowers the lightweight network to get a significant improvement on segmentation capability while retaining its runtime efficiency. We further devise a novel distillation module tailored for medical image segmentation to transfer semantic region information from teacher to student network. It forces the student network to mimic the extent of difference of representations calculated from different tissue regions. This module avoids the ambiguous boundary problem encountered when dealing with medical imaging but instead encodes the internal information of each semantic region for transferring. Benefited from our module, the lightweight network could receive an improvement of up to 32.6% in our experiment while maintaining its portability in the inference phase. The entire structure has been verified on two widely accepted public CT datasets LiTS17 and KiTS19. We demonstrate that a lightweight network distilled by our method has non-negligible value in the scenario which requires relatively high operating speed and low storage usage.

In this paper, we develop a voxel-based network for point cloud completion by leveraging edge generation (VE-PCN). We first embed point clouds into regular voxel grids, and then generate complete objects with the help of the hallucinated shape edges. This decoupled architecture together with a multi-scale grid feature learning is able to generate more realistic on-surface details. We evaluate our model on the publicly available completion datasets and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract:** Wireless systems resource allocation refers to perpetual and challenging nonconvex constrained optimization tasks, which are especially timely in modern communications and networking setups involving multiple users with heterogeneous objectives and imprecise or even unknown models and/or channel statistics. In this paper, we propose a technically grounded and scalable primal-dual deterministic policy gradient method for efficiently learning optimal parameterized resource allocation policies. Our method not only efficiently exploits gradient availability of popular universal policy representations, such as deep neural networks, but is also truly model-free, as it relies on consistent zeroth-order gradient approximations of the associated random network services constructed via low-dimensional perturbations in action space, thus fully bypassing any dependence on critics. Both theory and numerical simulations confirm the efficacy and applicability of the proposed approach, as well as its superiority over the current state of the art in terms of both achieving near-optimal performance and scalability.

**Abstract:** Social science studies dealing with control in networks typically resort to heuristics or describing the static control distribution. Optimal policies, however, require interventions that optimize control over a socioeconomic network subject to real-world constraints. We integrate optimisation tools from deep-learning with network science into a framework that is able to optimize such interventions in real-world networks. We demonstrate the framework in the context of corporate control, where it allows to characterize the vulnerability of strategically important corporate networks to sensitive takeovers, an important contemporaneous policy challenge. The framework produces insights that are relevant for governing real-world socioeconomic networks, and opens up new research avenues for improving our understanding and control of such complex systems.

**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown a potential for having low energy with unsupervised learning capabilities due to their biologically-inspired computation. However, they may suffer from accuracy degradation if their processing is performed under the presence of hardware-induced faults in memories, which can come from manufacturing defects or voltage-induced approximation errors. Since recent works still focus on the fault-modeling and random fault injection in SNNs, the impact of memory faults in SNN hardware architectures on accuracy and the respective fault-mitigation techniques are not thoroughly explored. Toward this, we propose ReSpawn, a novel framework for mitigating the negative impacts of faults in both the off-chip and on-chip memories for resilient and energy-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of ReSpawn are: (1) analyzing the fault tolerance of SNNs; and (2) improving the SNN fault tolerance through (a) fault-aware mapping (FAM) in memories, and (b) fault-aware training-and-mapping (FATM). If the training dataset is not fully available, FAM is employed through efficient bit-shuffling techniques that place the significant bits on the non-faulty memory cells and the insignificant bits on the faulty ones, while minimizing the memory access energy. Meanwhile, if the training dataset is fully available, FATM is employed by considering the faulty memory cells in the data mapping and training processes. The experimental results show that, compared to the baseline SNN without fault-mitigation techniques, ReSpawn with a fault-aware mapping scheme improves the accuracy by up to 70% for a network with 900 neurons without retraining.

**Abstract:** Traditionally, 1D models based on scaling laws have been used to parameterized convective heat transfer rocks in the interior of terrestrial planets like Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus to tackle the computational bottleneck of high-fidelity forward runs in 2D or 3D. However, these are limited in the amount of physics they can model (e.g. depth dependent material properties) and predict only mean quantities such as the mean mantle temperature. We recently showed that feedforward neural networks (FNN) trained using a large number of 2D simulations can overcome this limitation and reliably predict the evolution of entire 1D laterally-averaged temperature profile in time for complex models. We now extend that approach to predict the full 2D temperature field, which contains more information in the form of convection structures such as hot plumes and cold downwellings. Using a dataset of 10,525 two-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution of the mantle of a Mars-like planet, we show that deep learning techniques can produce reliable parameterized surrogates (i.e. surrogates that predict state variables such as temperature based only on parameters) of the underlying partial differential equations. We first use convolutional autoencoders to compress the temperature fields by a factor of 142 and then use FNN and long-short term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the compressed fields. On average, the FNN predictions are 99.30% and the LSTM predictions are 99.22% accurate with respect to unseen simulations. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the LSTM and FNN predictions shows that despite a lower mean absolute relative accuracy, LSTMs capture the flow dynamics better than FNNs. When summed, the POD coefficients from FNN predictions and from LSTM predictions amount to 96.51% and 97.66% relative to the coefficients of the original simulations, respectively.

**Abstract:** Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent hematologic malignancy in children and adolescents. A strong prognostic factor in ALL is given by the Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), which is a measure for the number of leukemic cells persistent in a patient. Manual MRD assessment from Multiparameter Flow Cytometry (FCM) data after treatment is time-consuming and subjective. In this work, we present an automated method to compute the MRD value directly from FCM data. We present a novel neural network approach based on the transformer architecture that learns to directly identify blast cells in a sample. We train our method in a supervised manner and evaluate it on publicly available ALL FCM data from three different clinical centers. Our method reaches a median f1 score of ~0.93 when tested on 200 B-ALL samples.

**Abstract:** We give tight bounds on the relation between the primal and dual of various combinatorial dimensions, such as the pseudo-dimension and fat-shattering dimension, for multi-valued function classes. These dimensional notions play an important role in the area of learning theory. We first review some (folklore) results that bound the dual dimension of a function class in terms of its primal, and after that give (almost) matching lower bounds. In particular, we give an appropriate generalization to multi-valued function classes of a well-known bound due to Assouad (1983), that relates the primal and dual VC-dimension of a binary function class.

**Abstract:** Positive-feedback (PF) device and its operation scheme to implement pulse width modulation (PWM) function was proposed and demonstrated, and the device operation mechanism for implementing PWM function was analyzed. By adjusting the amount of the charge stored in the n- floating body (Qn), the potential of the floating body linearly changes with time. When Qn reaches to a threshold value (Qth), the PF device turns on abruptly. From the linear time-varying property of Qn and the gate bias dependency of Qth, fully functionable PWM neuron properties including voltage to pulse width conversion and hard-sigmoid activation function were successfully obtained from a single PF device. A PWM neuron can be implemented by using a single PF device, thus it is beneficial to extremely reduce the area of a PWM neuron circuit than the previously reported one.

**Abstract:** Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a popular scheme for non-linear non-parametric learning. However, existing implementations of KRR require that all the data is stored in the main memory, which severely limits the use of KRR in contexts where data size far exceeds the memory size. Such applications are increasingly common in data mining, bioinformatics, and control. A powerful paradigm for computing on data sets that are too large for memory is the streaming model of computation, where we process one data sample at a time, discarding each sample before moving on to the next one. In this paper, we propose StreaMRAK - a streaming version of KRR. StreaMRAK improves on existing KRR schemes by dividing the problem into several levels of resolution, which allows continual refinement to the predictions. The algorithm reduces the memory requirement by continuously and efficiently integrating new samples into the training model. With a novel sub-sampling scheme, StreaMRAK reduces memory and computational complexities by creating a sketch of the original data, where the sub-sampling density is adapted to the bandwidth of the kernel and the local dimensionality of the data. We present a showcase study on two synthetic problems and the prediction of the trajectory of a double pendulum. The results show that the proposed algorithm is fast and accurate.

**Abstract:** The standard semantics of multi-agent epistemic logic $S5$ is based on Kripke models whose accessibility relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive. This one dimensional structure contains implicit higher-dimensional information beyond pairwise interactions, that has been formalized as pure simplicial models in previous work from the authors. Here we extend the theory to encompass all simplicial models - including the ones that are not pure. The corresponding Kripke models are those where the accessibility relation is symmetric and transitive, but might not be reflexive. This yields the epistemic logic $KB4$ which can reason about situations where some of the agents may die.

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning has been widely used to train transformer-based vision-language models for video-text alignment and multi-modal representation learning. This paper presents a new algorithm called Token-Aware Cascade contrastive learning (TACo) that improves contrastive learning using two novel techniques. The first is the token-aware contrastive loss which is computed by taking into account the syntactic classes of words. This is motivated by the observation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as nouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the video than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to generate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation for multi-modal fusion layers. To validate the effectiveness of TACo, in our experiments we finetune pretrained models for a set of downstream tasks including text-video retrieval (YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet), video action step localization (CrossTask), video action segmentation (COIN). The results show that our models attain consistent improvements across different experimental settings over previous methods, setting new state-of-the-art on three public text-video retrieval benchmarks of YouCook2, MSR-VTT and ActivityNet.
