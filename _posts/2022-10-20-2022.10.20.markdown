**Abstract:** Training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent on a real-world robotics task remains generally impractical due to sample inefficiency. Multi-task RL and meta-RL aim to improve sample efficiency by generalizing over a distribution of related tasks. However, doing so is difficult in practice: In multi-task RL, state of the art methods often fail to outperform a degenerate solution that simply learns each task separately. Hypernetworks are a promising path forward since they replicate the separate policies of the degenerate solution while also allowing for generalization across tasks, and are applicable to meta-RL. However, evidence from supervised learning suggests hypernetwork performance is highly sensitive to the initialization. In this paper, we 1) show that hypernetwork initialization is also a critical factor in meta-RL, and that naive initializations yield poor performance; 2) propose a novel hypernetwork initialization scheme that matches or exceeds the performance of a state-of-the-art approach proposed for supervised settings, as well as being simpler and more general; and 3) use this method to show that hypernetworks can improve performance in meta-RL by evaluating on multiple simulated robotics benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Current deep learning methods for object recognition are purely data-driven and require a large number of training samples to achieve good results. Due to their sole dependence on image data, these methods tend to fail when confronted with new environments where even small deviations occur. Human perception, however, has proven to be significantly more robust to such distribution shifts. It is assumed that their ability to deal with unknown scenarios is based on extensive incorporation of contextual knowledge. Context can be based either on object co-occurrences in a scene or on memory of experience. In accordance with the human visual cortex which uses context to form different object representations for a seen image, we propose an approach that enhances deep learning methods by using external contextual knowledge encoded in a knowledge graph. Therefore, we extract different contextual views from a generic knowledge graph, transform the views into vector space and infuse it into a DNN. We conduct a series of experiments to investigate the impact of different contextual views on the learned object representations for the same image dataset. The experimental results provide evidence that the contextual views influence the image representations in the DNN differently and therefore lead to different predictions for the same images. We also show that context helps to strengthen the robustness of object recognition models for out-of-distribution images, usually occurring in transfer learning tasks or real-world scenarios.

**Abstract:** Many existing works on singing voice conversion (SVC) require clean recordings of target singer's voice for training. However, it is often difficult to collect them in advance and singing voices are often distorted with reverb and accompaniment music. In this work, we propose robust one-shot SVC (ROSVC) that performs any-to-any SVC robustly even on such distorted singing voices using less than 10s of a reference voice. To this end, we propose two-stage training method called Robustify. In the first stage, a novel one-shot SVC model based on a generative adversarial network is trained on clean data to ensure high-quality conversion. In the second stage, enhancement modules are introduced to the encoders of the model to improve the robustness against distortions in the feature space. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms one-shot SVC baselines for both seen and unseen singers and greatly improves the robustness against the distortions.

**Abstract:** Deep classifiers are known to rely on spurious features $\unicode{x2013}$ patterns which are correlated with the target on the training data but not inherently relevant to the learning problem, such as the image backgrounds when classifying the foregrounds. In this paper we evaluate the amount of information about the core (non-spurious) features that can be decoded from the representations learned by standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) and specialized group robustness training. Following recent work on Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR), we evaluate the feature representations by re-training the last layer of the model on a held-out set where the spurious correlation is broken. On multiple vision and NLP problems, we show that the features learned by simple ERM are highly competitive with the features learned by specialized group robustness methods targeted at reducing the effect of spurious correlations. Moreover, we show that the quality of learned feature representations is greatly affected by the design decisions beyond the training method, such as the model architecture and pre-training strategy. On the other hand, we find that strong regularization is not necessary for learning high quality feature representations. Finally, using insights from our analysis, we significantly improve upon the best results reported in the literature on the popular Waterbirds, CelebA hair color prediction and WILDS-FMOW problems, achieving 97%, 92% and 50% worst-group accuracies, respectively.

**Abstract:** Creation of 3D content by stylization is a promising yet challenging problem in computer vision and graphics research. In this work, we focus on stylizing photorealistic appearance renderings of a given surface mesh of arbitrary topology. Motivated by the recent surge of cross-modal supervision of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we propose TANGO, which transfers the appearance style of a given 3D shape according to a text prompt in a photorealistic manner. Technically, we propose to disentangle the appearance style as the spatially varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function, the local geometric variation, and the lighting condition, which are jointly optimized, via supervision of the CLIP loss, by a spherical Gaussians based differentiable renderer. As such, TANGO enables photorealistic 3D style transfer by automatically predicting reflectance effects even for bare, low-quality meshes, without training on a task-specific dataset. Extensive experiments show that TANGO outperforms existing methods of text-driven 3D style transfer in terms of photorealistic quality, consistency of 3D geometry, and robustness when stylizing low-quality meshes.

**Abstract:** Concerns about the reproducibility of deep learning research are more prominent than ever, with no clear solution in sight. The relevance of machine learning research can only be improved if we also employ empirical rigor that incorporates reproducibility guidelines, especially so in the medical imaging field. The Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) conference has made advancements in this direction by advocating open access, and recently also recommending authors to make their code public - both aspects being adopted by the majority of the conference submissions. This helps the reproducibility of the methods, however, there is currently little or no support for further evaluation of these supplementary material, making them vulnerable to poor quality, which affects the impact of the entire submission. We have evaluated all accepted full paper submissions to MIDL between 2018 and 2022 using established, but slightly adjusted guidelines on reproducibility and the quality of the public repositories. The evaluations show that publishing repositories and using public datasets are becoming more popular, which helps traceability, but the quality of the repositories has not improved over the years, leaving room for improvement in every aspect of designing repositories. Merely 22% of all submissions contain a repository that were deemed repeatable using our evaluations. From the commonly encountered issues during the evaluations, we propose a set of guidelines for machine learning-related research for medical imaging applications, adjusted specifically for future submissions to MIDL.

**Abstract:** We introduce Breaking Bad, a large-scale dataset of fractured objects. Our dataset consists of over one million fractured objects simulated from ten thousand base models. The fracture simulation is powered by a recent physically based algorithm that efficiently generates a variety of fracture modes of an object. Existing shape assembly datasets decompose objects according to semantically meaningful parts, effectively modeling the construction process. In contrast, Breaking Bad models the destruction process of how a geometric object naturally breaks into fragments. Our dataset serves as a benchmark that enables the study of fractured object reassembly and presents new challenges for geometric shape understanding. We analyze our dataset with several geometry measurements and benchmark three state-of-the-art shape assembly deep learning methods under various settings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the difficulty of our dataset, calling on future research in model designs specifically for the geometric shape assembly task. We host our dataset at https://breaking-bad-dataset.github.io/.

**Abstract:** The number of states in a dynamic process is exponential in the number of objects, making reinforcement learning (RL) difficult in complex, multi-object domains. For agents to scale to the real world, they will need to react to and reason about unseen combinations of objects. We argue that the ability to recognize and use local factorization in transition dynamics is a key element in unlocking the power of multi-object reasoning. To this end, we show that (1) known local structure in the environment transitions is sufficient for an exponential reduction in the sample complexity of training a dynamics model, and (2) a locally factored dynamics model provably generalizes out-of-distribution to unseen states and actions. Knowing the local structure also allows us to predict which unseen states and actions this dynamics model will generalize to. We propose to leverage these observations in a novel Model-based Counterfactual Data Augmentation (MoCoDA) framework. MoCoDA applies a learned locally factored dynamics model to an augmented distribution of states and actions to generate counterfactual transitions for RL. MoCoDA works with a broader set of local structures than prior work and allows for direct control over the augmented training distribution. We show that MoCoDA enables RL agents to learn policies that generalize to unseen states and actions. We use MoCoDA to train an offline RL agent to solve an out-of-distribution robotics manipulation task on which standard offline RL algorithms fail.

**Abstract:** Hypothesis testing and the usage of expert knowledge, or causal priors, has not been well explored in the context of generative models. We propose a novel set of generative architectures, Causal Gen and Causal Variational Gen, that can utilize nonparametric structural causal knowledge combined with a deep learning functional approximation. We show how, using a deliberate (non-random) split of training and testing data, these models can generalize better to similar, but out-of-distribution data points, than non-causal generative models and prediction models such as Variational autoencoders and Fully Connected Neural Networks. We explore using this generalization error as a proxy for causal model hypothesis testing. We further show how dropout can be used to learn functional relationships of structural models that are difficult to learn with traditional methods. We validate our methods on a synthetic pendulum dataset, as well as a trauma surgery ground level fall dataset.

**Abstract:** Masked image modeling (MIM) has been recognized as a strong and popular self-supervised pre-training approach in the vision domain. However, the interpretability of the mechanism and properties of the learned representations by such a scheme are so far not well-explored. In this work, through comprehensive experiments and empirical studies on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), we address two critical questions to explore the behaviors of the learned representations: (i) Are the latent representations in Masked Autoencoders linearly separable if the input is a mixture of two images instead of one? This can be concrete evidence used to explain why MAE-learned representations have superior performance on downstream tasks, as proven by many literature impressively. (ii) What is the degree of semantics encoded in the latent feature space by Masked Autoencoders? To explore these two problems, we propose a simple yet effective Interpretable MAE (i-MAE) framework with a two-way image reconstruction and a latent feature reconstruction with distillation loss to help us understand the behaviors inside MAE's structure. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K datasets to verify the observations we discovered. Furthermore, in addition to qualitatively analyzing the characteristics of the latent representations, we examine the existence of linear separability and the degree of semantics in the latent space by proposing two novel metrics. The surprising and consistent results across the qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that i-MAE is a superior framework design for interpretability research of MAE frameworks, as well as achieving better representational ability.

**Abstract:** A mainstream type of current self-supervised learning methods pursues a general-purpose representation that can be well transferred to downstream tasks, typically by optimizing on a given pretext task such as instance discrimination. In this work, we argue that existing pretext tasks inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation, which in turn leads to biased transfer performance on various downstream tasks. To cope with this issue, we propose Maximum Entropy Coding (MEC), a more principled objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to unseen downstream tasks. Inspired by the principle of maximum entropy in information theory, we hypothesize that a generalizable representation should be the one that admits the maximum entropy among all plausible representations. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a scalable reformulation of the objective that allows fast computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEC learns a more generalizable representation than previous methods based on specific pretext tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance consistently on various downstream tasks, including not only ImageNet linear probe, but also semi-supervised classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and object tracking. Interestingly, we show that existing batch-wise and feature-wise self-supervised objectives could be seen equivalent to low-order approximations of MEC. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/xinliu20/MEC.

**Abstract:** A natural goal in multiagent learning besides finding equilibria is to learn rationalizable behavior, where players learn to avoid iteratively dominated actions. However, even in the basic setting of multiplayer general-sum games, existing algorithms require a number of samples exponential in the number of players to learn rationalizable equilibria under bandit feedback. This paper develops the first line of efficient algorithms for learning rationalizable Coarse Correlated Equilibria (CCE) and Correlated Equilibria (CE) whose sample complexities are polynomial in all problem parameters including the number of players. To achieve this result, we also develop a new efficient algorithm for the simpler task of finding one rationalizable action profile (not necessarily an equilibrium), whose sample complexity substantially improves over the best existing results of Wu et al. (2021). Our algorithms incorporate several novel techniques to guarantee rationalizability and no (swap-)regret simultaneously, including a correlated exploration scheme and adaptive learning rates, which may be of independent interest. We complement our results with a sample complexity lower bound showing the sharpness of our guarantees.

**Abstract:** This work focuses on the apparent emotional reaction recognition (AERR) from the video-only input, conducted in a self-supervised fashion. The network is first pre-trained on different self-supervised pretext tasks and later fine-tuned on the downstream target task. Self-supervised learning facilitates the use of pre-trained architectures and larger datasets that might be deemed unfit for the target task and yet might be useful to learn informative representations and hence provide useful initializations for further fine-tuning on smaller more suitable data. Our presented contribution is two-fold: (1) an analysis of different state-of-the-art (SOTA) pretext tasks for the video-only apparent emotional reaction recognition architecture, and (2) an analysis of various combinations of the regression and classification losses that are likely to improve the performance further. Together these two contributions result in the current state-of-the-art performance for the video-only spontaneous apparent emotional reaction recognition with continuous annotations.

**Abstract:** We apply the PAC-Bayes theory to the setting of learning-to-optimize. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first framework to learn optimization algorithms with provable generalization guarantees (PAC-bounds) and explicit trade-off between a high probability of convergence and a high convergence speed. Even in the limit case, where convergence is guaranteed, our learned optimization algorithms provably outperform related algorithms based on a (deterministic) worst-case analysis. Our results rely on PAC-Bayes bounds for general, unbounded loss-functions based on exponential families. By generalizing existing ideas, we reformulate the learning procedure into a one-dimensional minimization problem and study the possibility to find a global minimum, which enables the algorithmic realization of the learning procedure. As a proof-of-concept, we learn hyperparameters of standard optimization algorithms to empirically underline our theory.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in self-supervised learning integrate Masked Modeling and Siamese Networks into a single framework to fully reap the advantages of both the two techniques. However, previous erasing-based masking scheme in masked image modeling is not originally designed for siamese networks. Existing approaches simply inherit the default loss design from previous siamese networks, and ignore the information loss and distance change after employing masking operation in the frameworks. In this paper, we propose a filling-based masking strategy called MixMask to prevent information loss due to the randomly erased areas of an image in vanilla masking method. We further introduce a dynamic loss function design with soft distance to adapt the integrated architecture and avoid mismatches between transformed input and objective in Masked Siamese ConvNets (MSCN). The dynamic loss distance is calculated according to the proposed mix-masking scheme. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets of CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better accuracy on linear probing, semi-supervised and {supervised finetuning}, which outperforms the state-of-the-art MSCN by a significant margin. We also show the superiority on downstream tasks of object detection and segmentation. Our source code is available at https://github.com/LightnessOfBeing/MixMask.

**Abstract:** A major problem of deep neural networks for image classification is their vulnerability to domain changes at test-time. Recent methods have proposed to address this problem with test-time training (TTT), where a two-branch model is trained to learn a main classification task and also a self-supervised task used to perform test-time adaptation. However, these techniques require defining a proxy task specific to the target application. To tackle this limitation, we propose TTTFlow: a Y-shaped architecture using an unsupervised head based on Normalizing Flows to learn the normal distribution of latent features and detect domain shifts in test examples. At inference, keeping the unsupervised head fixed, we adapt the model to domain-shifted examples by maximizing the log likelihood of the Normalizing Flow. Our results show that our method can significantly improve the accuracy with respect to previous works.

**Abstract:** The mean field variational inference (MFVI) formulation restricts the general Bayesian inference problem to the subspace of product measures. We present a framework to analyze MFVI algorithms, which is inspired by a similar development for general variational Bayesian formulations. Our approach enables the MFVI problem to be represented in three different manners: a gradient flow on Wasserstein space, a system of Fokker-Planck-like equations and a diffusion process. Rigorous guarantees are established to show that a time-discretized implementation of the coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm in the product Wasserstein space of measures yields a gradient flow in the limit. A similar result is obtained for their associated densities, with the limit being given by a quasi-linear partial differential equation. A popular class of practical algorithms falls in this framework, which provides tools to establish convergence. We hope this framework could be used to guarantee convergence of algorithms in a variety of approaches, old and new, to solve variational inference problems.

**Abstract:** An every increasing number of clinical trials features a time-to-event outcome and records non-tabular patient data, such as magnetic resonance imaging or text data in the form of electronic health records. Recently, several neural-network based solutions have been proposed, some of which are binary classifiers. Parametric, distribution-free approaches which make full use of survival time and censoring status have not received much attention. We present deep conditional transformation models (DCTMs) for survival outcomes as a unifying approach to parametric and semiparametric survival analysis. DCTMs allow the specification of non-linear and non-proportional hazards for both tabular and non-tabular data and extend to all types of censoring and truncation. On real and semi-synthetic data, we show that DCTMs compete with state-of-the-art DL approaches to survival analysis.

**Abstract:** A key function of auditory cognition is the association of characteristic sounds with their corresponding semantics over time. Humans attempting to discriminate between fine-grained audio categories, often replay the same discriminative sounds to increase their prediction confidence. We propose an end-to-end attention-based architecture that through selective repetition attends over the most discriminative sounds across the audio sequence. Our model initially uses the full audio sequence and iteratively refines the temporal segments replayed based on slot attention. At each playback, the selected segments are replayed using a smaller hop length which represents higher resolution features within these segments. We show that our method can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across three audio-classification benchmarks: AudioSet, VGG-Sound, and EPIC-KITCHENS-100.

**Abstract:** When applying differential privacy to sensitive data, a common way of getting improved performance is to use external information such as other sensitive data, public data, or human priors. We propose to use the algorithms with predictions framework -- previously applied largely to improve time complexity or competitive ratios -- as a powerful way of designing and analyzing privacy-preserving methods that can take advantage of such external information to improve utility. For four important tasks -- quantile release, its extension to multiple quantiles, covariance estimation, and data release -- we construct prediction-dependent differentially private methods whose utility scales with natural measures of prediction quality. The analyses enjoy several advantages, including minimal assumptions about the data, natural ways of adding robustness to noisy predictions, and novel "meta" algorithms that can learn predictions from other (potentially sensitive) data. Overall, our results demonstrate how to enable differentially private algorithms to make use of and learn noisy predictions, which holds great promise for improving utility while preserving privacy across a variety of tasks.

**Abstract:** Due to depth ambiguities and occlusions, lifting 2D poses to 3D is a highly ill-posed problem. Well-calibrated distributions of possible poses can make these ambiguities explicit and preserve the resulting uncertainty for downstream tasks. This study shows that previous attempts, which account for these ambiguities via multiple hypotheses generation, produce miscalibrated distributions. We identify that miscalibration can be attributed to the use of sample-based metrics such as minMPJPE. In a series of simulations, we show that minimizing minMPJPE, as commonly done, should converge to the correct mean prediction. However, it fails to correctly capture the uncertainty, thus resulting in a miscalibrated distribution. To mitigate this problem, we propose an accurate and well-calibrated model called Conditional Graph Normalizing Flow (cGNFs). Our model is structured such that a single cGNF can estimate both conditional and marginal densities within the same model - effectively solving a zero-shot density estimation problem. We evaluate cGNF on the Human~3.6M dataset and show that cGNF provides a well-calibrated distribution estimate while being close to state-of-the-art in terms of overall minMPJPE. Furthermore, cGNF outperforms previous methods on occluded joints while it remains well-calibrated.

**Abstract:** Voice conversion is a task to convert a non-linguistic feature of a given utterance. Since naturalness of speech strongly depends on its pitch pattern, in some applications, it would be desirable to keep the original rise/fall pitch pattern while changing the speaker identity. Some of the existing methods address this problem by either using a source-filter model or developing a neural network that takes an F0 pattern as input to the model. Although the latter approach can achieve relatively high sound quality compared to the former one, there is no consideration for discrepancy between the target and generated F0 patterns in its training process. In this paper, we propose a new variational-autoencoder-based voice conversion model accompanied by an auxiliary network, which ensures that the conversion result correctly reflects the specified F0/timbre information. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by objective and subjective evaluations.

**Abstract:** As a booming research area in the past decade, deep learning technologies have been driven by big data collected and processed on an unprecedented scale. However, the sensitive information in the collected training data raises privacy concerns. Recent research indicated that deep learning models are vulnerable to various privacy attacks, including membership inference attacks, attribute inference attacks, and gradient inversion attacks. It is noteworthy that the performance of the attacks varies from model to model. In this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to answer a fundamental question: Does model architecture affect model privacy? We investigate several representative model architectures from CNNs to Transformers, and show that Transformers are generally more vulnerable to privacy attacks than CNNs. We further demonstrate that the micro design of activation layers, stem layers, and bias parameters, are the major reasons why CNNs are more resilient to privacy attacks than Transformers. We also find that the presence of attention modules is another reason why Transformers are more vulnerable to privacy attacks. We hope our discovery can shed some new light on how to defend against the investigated privacy attacks and help the community build privacy-friendly model architectures.

**Abstract:** Recently, 3D scenes parsing with deep learning approaches has been a heating topic. However, current methods with fully-supervised models require manually annotated point-wise supervision which is extremely user-unfriendly and time-consuming to obtain. As such, training 3D scene parsing models with sparse supervision is an intriguing alternative. We term this task as data-efficient 3D scene parsing and propose an effective two-stage framework named VIBUS to resolve it by exploiting the enormous unlabeled points. In the first stage, we perform self-supervised representation learning on unlabeled points with the proposed Viewpoint Bottleneck loss function. The loss function is derived from an information bottleneck objective imposed on scenes under different viewpoints, making the process of representation learning free of degradation and sampling. In the second stage, pseudo labels are harvested from the sparse labels based on uncertainty-spectrum modeling. By combining data-driven uncertainty measures and 3D mesh spectrum measures (derived from normal directions and geodesic distances), a robust local affinity metric is obtained. Finite gamma/beta mixture models are used to decompose category-wise distributions of these measures, leading to automatic selection of thresholds. We evaluate VIBUS on the public benchmark ScanNet and achieve state-of-the-art results on both validation set and online test server. Ablation studies show that both Viewpoint Bottleneck and uncertainty-spectrum modeling bring significant improvements. Codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/VIBUS.

**Abstract:** In this note we demonstrate provable convergence of SGD to the global minima of appropriately regularized $\ell_2-$empirical risk of depth $2$ nets -- for arbitrary data and with any number of gates, if they are using adequately smooth and bounded activations like sigmoid and tanh. We build on the results in [1] and leverage a constant amount of Frobenius norm regularization on the weights, along with sampling of the initial weights from an appropriate distribution. We also give a continuous time SGD convergence result that also applies to smooth unbounded activations like SoftPlus. Our key idea is to show the existence loss functions on constant sized neural nets which are "Villani Functions". [1] Bin Shi, Weijie J. Su, and Michael I. Jordan.

**Abstract:** We introduce a modified version of the excess risk, which can be used to obtain tighter, fast-rate PAC-Bayesian generalisation bounds. This modified excess risk leverages information about the relative hardness of data examples to reduce the variance of its empirical counterpart, tightening the bound. We combine this with a new bound for $[-1, 1]$-valued (and potentially non-independent) signed losses, which is more favourable when they empirically have low variance around $0$. The primary new technical tool is a novel result for sequences of interdependent random vectors which may be of independent interest. We empirically evaluate these new bounds on a number of real-world datasets.

**Abstract:** Current adversarial attacks for motion estimation (optical flow) optimize small per-pixel perturbations, which are unlikely to appear in the real world. In contrast, we exploit a real-world weather phenomenon for a novel attack with adversarially optimized snow. At the core of our attack is a differentiable renderer that consistently integrates photorealistic snowflakes with realistic motion into the 3D scene. Through optimization we obtain adversarial snow that significantly impacts the optical flow while being indistinguishable from ordinary snow. Surprisingly, the impact of our novel attack is largest on methods that previously showed a high robustness to small L_p perturbations.

**Abstract:** The alfalfa crop is globally important as livestock feed, so highly efficient planting and harvesting could benefit many industries, especially as the global climate changes and traditional methods become less accurate. Recent work using machine learning (ML) to predict yields for alfalfa and other crops has shown promise. Previous efforts used remote sensing, weather, planting, and soil data to train machine learning models for yield prediction. However, while remote sensing works well, the models require large amounts of data and cannot make predictions until the harvesting season begins. Using weather and planting data from alfalfa variety trials in Kentucky and Georgia, our previous work compared feature selection techniques to find the best technique and best feature set. In this work, we trained a variety of machine learning models, using cross validation for hyperparameter optimization, to predict biomass yields, and we showed better accuracy than similar work that employed more complex techniques. Our best individual model was a random forest with a mean absolute error of 0.081 tons/acre and R{$^2$} of 0.941. Next, we expanded this dataset to include Wisconsin and Mississippi, and we repeated our experiments, obtaining a higher best R{$^2$} of 0.982 with a regression tree. We then isolated our testing datasets by state to explore this problem's eligibility for domain adaptation (DA), as we trained on multiple source states and tested on one target state. This Trivial DA (TDA) approach leaves plenty of room for improvement through exploring more complex DA techniques in forthcoming work.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we aim to design a quantitative similarity function between two neural architectures. Specifically, we define a model similarity using input gradient transferability. We generate adversarial samples of two networks and measure the average accuracy of the networks on adversarial samples of each other. If two networks are highly correlated, then the attack transferability will be high, resulting in high similarity. Using the similarity score, we investigate two topics: (1) Which network component contributes to the model diversity? (2) How does model diversity affect practical scenarios? We answer the first question by providing feature importance analysis and clustering analysis. The second question is validated by two different scenarios: model ensemble and knowledge distillation. Our findings show that model diversity takes a key role when interacting with different neural architectures. For example, we found that more diversity leads to better ensemble performance. We also observe that the relationship between teacher and student networks and distillation performance depends on the choice of the base architecture of the teacher and student networks. We expect our analysis tool helps a high-level understanding of differences between various neural architectures as well as practical guidance when using multiple architectures.

**Abstract:** While interacting with chatbots, users may elicit multiple intents in a single dialogue utterance. Instead of training a dedicated multi-intent detection model, we propose DialogUSR, a dialogue utterance splitting and reformulation task that first splits multi-intent user query into several single-intent sub-queries and then recovers all the coreferred and omitted information in the sub-queries. DialogUSR can serve as a plug-in and domain-agnostic module that empowers the multi-intent detection for the deployed chatbots with minimal efforts. We collect a high-quality naturally occurring dataset that covers 23 domains with a multi-step crowd-souring procedure. To benchmark the proposed dataset, we propose multiple action-based generative models that involve end-to-end and two-stage training, and conduct in-depth analyses on the pros and cons of the proposed baselines.

**Abstract:** The automatic synthesis of a policy through reinforcement learning (RL) from a given set of formal requirements depends on the construction of a reward signal and consists of the iterative application of many policy-improvement steps. The synthesis algorithm has to balance target, safety, and comfort requirements in a single objective and to guarantee that the policy improvement does not increase the number of safety-requirements violations, especially for safety-critical applications. In this work, we present a solution to the synthesis problem by solving its two main challenges: reward-shaping from a set of formal requirements and safe policy update. For the former, we propose an automatic reward-shaping procedure, defining a scalar reward signal compliant with the task specification. For the latter, we introduce an algorithm ensuring that the policy is improved in a safe fashion with high-confidence guarantees. We also discuss the adoption of a model-based RL algorithm to efficiently use the collected data and train a model-free agent on the predicted trajectories, where the safety violation does not have the same impact as in the real world. Finally, we demonstrate in standard control benchmarks that the resulting learning procedure is effective and robust even under heavy perturbations of the hyperparameters.

**Abstract:** Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs the translation while receiving the source inputs, and hence needs to balance the received source information and translated target information to make a reasonable decision between waiting for inputs or outputting translation. Previous methods always balance source and target information at the token level, either directly waiting for a fixed number of tokens or adjusting the waiting based on the current token. In this paper, we propose a Wait-info Policy to balance source and target at the information level. We first quantify the amount of information contained in each token, named info. Then during simultaneous translation, the decision of waiting or outputting is made based on the comparison results between the total info of previous target outputs and received source inputs. Experiments show that our method outperforms strong baselines under and achieves better balance via the proposed info.

**Abstract:** Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to discern outliers from the intended data distribution, which is crucial to maintaining high reliability and a good user experience. Most recent studies in OOD detection utilize the information from a single representation that resides in the penultimate layer to determine whether the input is anomalous or not. Although such a method is straightforward, the potential of diverse information in the intermediate layers is overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on contrastive learning that encourages intermediate features to learn layer-specialized representations and assembles them implicitly into a single representation to absorb rich information in the pre-trained language model. Extensive experiments in various intent classification and OOD datasets demonstrate that our approach is significantly more effective than other works.

**Abstract:** A common approach to transfer learning under distribution shift is to fine-tune the last few layers of a pre-trained model, preserving learned features while also adapting to the new task. This paper shows that in such settings, selectively fine-tuning a subset of layers (which we term surgical fine-tuning) matches or outperforms commonly used fine-tuning approaches. Moreover, the type of distribution shift influences which subset is more effective to tune: for example, for image corruptions, fine-tuning only the first few layers works best. We validate our findings systematically across seven real-world data tasks spanning three types of distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove that for two-layer neural networks in an idealized setting, first-layer tuning can outperform fine-tuning all layers. Intuitively, fine-tuning more parameters on a small target dataset can cause information learned during pre-training to be forgotten, and the relevant information depends on the type of shift.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Deep Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) reconstruction method (PIDD). PIDD contains two main components: The multi-shot DWI data synthesis and a deep learning reconstruction network. For data synthesis, we first mathematically analyze the motion during the multi-shot data acquisition and approach it by a simplified physical motion model. The motion model inspires a polynomial model for motion-induced phase synthesis. Then, lots of synthetic phases are combined with a few real data to generate a large amount of training data. For reconstruction network, we exploit the smoothness property of each shot image phase as learnable convolution kernels in the k-space and complementary sparsity in the image domain. Results on both synthetic and in vivo brain data show that, the proposed PIDD trained on synthetic data enables sub-second ultra-fast, high-quality, and robust reconstruction with different b-values and undersampling patterns.

**Abstract:** We present and analyze the Krylov-Bellman Boosting (KBB) algorithm for policy evaluation in general state spaces. It alternates between fitting the Bellman residual using non-parametric regression (as in boosting), and estimating the value function via the least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) procedure applied with a feature set that grows adaptively over time. By exploiting the connection to Krylov methods, we equip this method with two attractive guarantees. First, we provide a general convergence bound that allows for separate estimation errors in residual fitting and LSTD computation. Consistent with our numerical experiments, this bound shows that convergence rates depend on the restricted spectral structure, and are typically super-linear. Second, by combining this meta-result with sample-size dependent guarantees for residual fitting and LSTD computation, we obtain concrete statistical guarantees that depend on the sample size along with the complexity of the function class used to fit the residuals. We illustrate the behavior of the KBB algorithm for various types of policy evaluation problems, and typically find large reductions in sample complexity relative to the standard approach of fitted value iterationn.

**Abstract:** We propose a generalization of the synthetic controls and synthetic interventions methodology to incorporate network interference. We consider the estimation of unit-specific treatment effects from panel data where there are spillover effects across units and in the presence of unobserved confounding. Key to our approach is a novel latent factor model that takes into account network interference and generalizes the factor models typically used in panel data settings. We propose an estimator, "network synthetic interventions", and show that it consistently estimates the mean outcomes for a unit under an arbitrary sequence of treatments for itself and its neighborhood, given certain observation patterns hold in the data. We corroborate our theoretical findings with simulations.

**Abstract:** Real world datasets contain incorrectly labeled instances that hamper the performance of the model and, in particular, the ability to generalize out of distribution. Also, each example might have different contribution towards learning. This motivates studies to better understanding of the role of data instances with respect to their contribution in good metrics in models. In this paper we propose a method based on metrics computed from training dynamics of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs) to assess the behavior of each training example. We focus on datasets containing mostly tabular or structured data, for which the use of Decision Trees ensembles are still the state-of-the-art in terms of performance. We show results on detecting noisy labels in order to either remove them, improving models' metrics in synthetic and real datasets, as well as a productive dataset. Our methods achieved the best results overall when compared with confident learning and heuristics.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning is applied to solve actual complex tasks from high-dimensional, sensory inputs. The last decade has developed a long list of reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent progress benefits from deep learning for raw sensory signal representation. One question naturally arises: how well do they perform concerning different robotic manipulation tasks? Benchmarks use objective performance metrics to offer a scientific way to compare algorithms. In this paper, we present RMBench, the first benchmark for robotic manipulations, which have high-dimensional continuous action and state spaces. We implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that directly use observed pixels as inputs. We report their average performance and learning curves to show their performance and stability of training. Our study concludes that none of the studied algorithms can handle all tasks well, soft Actor-Critic outperforms most algorithms in average reward and stability, and an algorithm combined with data augmentation may facilitate learning policies.

**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) model continuous time dynamics as differential equations parametrized with neural networks. Thanks to their modeling flexibility, they have been adopted for multiple tasks where the continuous time nature of the process is specially relevant, as in system identification and time series analysis. When applied in a control setting, it is possible to adapt their use to approximate optimal nonlinear feedback policies. This formulation follows the same approach as policy gradients in reinforcement learning, covering the case where the environment consists of known deterministic dynamics given by a system of differential equations. The white box nature of the model specification allows the direct calculation of policy gradients through sensitivity analysis, avoiding the inexact and inefficient gradient estimation through sampling. In this work we propose the use of a neural control policy posed as a Neural ODE to solve general nonlinear optimal control problems while satisfying both state and control constraints, which are crucial for real world scenarios. Since the state feedback policy partially modifies the model dynamics, the whole space phase of the system is reshaped upon the optimization. This approach is a sensible approximation to the historically intractable closed loop solution of nonlinear control problems that efficiently exploits the availability of a dynamical system model.

**Abstract:** Spectroscopic data may often contain unwanted extrinsic signals. For example, in ARPES experiment, a wire mesh is typically placed in front of the CCD to block stray photo-electrons, but could cause a grid-like structure in the spectra during quick measurement mode. In the past, this structure was often removed using the mathematical Fourier filtering method by erasing the periodic structure. However, this method may lead to information loss and vacancies in the spectra because the grid structure is not strictly linearly superimposed. Here, we propose a deep learning method to effectively overcome this problem. Our method takes advantage of the self-correlation information within the spectra themselves and can greatly optimize the quality of the spectra while removing the grid structure and noise simultaneously. It has the potential to be extended to all spectroscopic measurements to eliminate other extrinsic signals and enhance the spectral quality based on the self-correlation of the spectra solely.

**Abstract:** Filter pruning of a CNN is typically achieved by applying discrete masks on the CNN's filter weights or activation maps, post-training. Here, we present a new filter-importance-scoring concept named pruning by active attention manipulation (PAAM), that sparsifies the CNN's set of filters through a particular attention mechanism, during-training. PAAM learns analog filter scores from the filter weights by optimizing a cost function regularized by an additive term in the scores. As the filters are not independent, we use attention to dynamically learn their correlations. Moreover, by training the pruning scores of all layers simultaneously, PAAM can account for layer inter-dependencies, which is essential to finding a performant sparse sub-network. PAAM can also train and generate a pruned network from scratch in a straightforward, one-stage training process without requiring a pre-trained network. Finally, PAAM does not need layer-specific hyperparameters and pre-defined layer budgets, since it can implicitly determine the appropriate number of filters in each layer. Our experimental results on different network architectures suggest that PAAM outperforms state-of-the-art structured-pruning methods (SOTA). On CIFAR-10 dataset, without requiring a pre-trained baseline network, we obtain 1.02% and 1.19% accuracy gain and 52.3% and 54% parameters reduction, on ResNet56 and ResNet110, respectively. Similarly, on the ImageNet dataset, PAAM achieves 1.06% accuracy gain while pruning 51.1% of the parameters on ResNet50. For Cifar-10, this is better than the SOTA with a margin of 9.5% and 6.6%, respectively, and on ImageNet with a margin of 11%.

**Abstract:** Accurately extracting driving events is the way to maximize computational efficiency and anomaly detection performance in the tire frictional nose-based anomaly detection task. This study proposes a concise and highly useful method for improving the precision of the event extraction that is hindered by extra noise such as wind noise, which is difficult to characterize clearly due to its randomness. The core of the proposed method is based on the identification of the road friction sound corresponding to the frequency of interest and removing the opposite characteristics with several frequency filters. Our method enables precision maximization of driving event extraction while improving anomaly detection performance by an average of 8.506%. Therefore, we conclude our method is a practical solution suitable for road surface anomaly detection purposes in outdoor edge computing environments.

**Abstract:** As a basic research problem for building effective recommender systems, post-click conversion rate (CVR) estimation has long been plagued by sample selection bias and data sparsity issues. To address the data sparsity issue, prevalent methods based on entire space multi-task model leverage the sequential pattern of user actions, i.e. exposure $\rightarrow$ click $\rightarrow$ conversion to construct auxiliary learning tasks. However, they still fall short of guaranteeing the unbiasedness of CVR estimates. This paper theoretically demonstrates two defects of these entire space multi-task models: (1) inherent estimation bias (IEB) for CVR estimation, where the CVR estimate is inherently higher than the ground truth; (2) potential independence priority (PIP) for CTCVR estimation, where the causality from click to conversion might be overlooked. This paper further proposes a principled method named entire space counterfactual multi-task model (ESCM$^2$), which employs a counterfactual risk minimizer to handle both IEB and PIP issues at once. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, this paper explores its parameter tuning in practice, derives its analytic properties, and showcases its effectiveness in industrial CVR estimation, where ESCM$^2$ can effectively alleviate the intrinsic IEB and PIP issues and outperform baseline models.

**Abstract:** In this work, we tackle the problem of open-ended learning by introducing a method that simultaneously evolves agents and increasingly challenging environments. Unlike previous open-ended approaches that optimize agents using a fixed neural network topology, we hypothesize that generalization can be improved by allowing agents' controllers to become more complex as they encounter more difficult environments. Our method, Augmentative Topology EPOET (ATEP), extends the Enhanced Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (EPOET) algorithm by allowing agents to evolve their own neural network structures over time, adding complexity and capacity as necessary. Empirical results demonstrate that ATEP results in general agents capable of solving more environments than a fixed-topology baseline. We also investigate mechanisms for transferring agents between environments and find that a species-based approach further improves the performance and generalization of agents.

**Abstract:** This study addresses the problem of selecting dynamically, at each time instance, the ``optimal'' p-norm to combat outliers in linear adaptive filtering without any knowledge on the potentially time-varying probability distribution function of the outliers. To this end, an online and data-driven framework is designed via kernel-based reinforcement learning (KBRL). Novel Bellman mappings on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) are introduced that need no knowledge on transition probabilities of Markov decision processes, and are nonexpansive with respect to the underlying Hilbertian norm. An approximate policy-iteration framework is finally offered via the introduction of a finite-dimensional affine superset of the fixed-point set of the proposed Bellman mappings. The well-known ``curse of dimensionality'' in RKHSs is addressed by building a basis of vectors via an approximate linear dependency criterion. Numerical tests on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed framework selects always the ``optimal'' p-norm for the outlier scenario at hand, outperforming at the same time several non-RL and KBRL schemes.

**Abstract:** Many car accidents are caused by human distractions, including cognitive distractions. In-vehicle human-machine interfaces (HMIs) have evolved throughout the years, providing more and more functions. Interaction with the HMIs can, however, also lead to further distractions and, as a consequence, accidents. To tackle this problem, we propose using adaptive HMIs that change according to the mental workload of the driver. In this work, we present the current status as well as preliminary results of a user study using naturalistic secondary tasks while driving (i.e., the primary task) that attempt to understand the effects of one such interface.

**Abstract:** Timely detected anomalies in the chemical technological processes, as well as the earliest detection of the cause of the fault, significantly reduce the production cost in the industrial factories. Data on the state of the technological process and the operation of production equipment are received by a large number of different sensors. To better predict the behavior of the process and equipment, it is necessary not only to consider the behavior of the signals in each sensor separately, but also to take into account their correlation and hidden relationships with each other. Graph-based data representation helps with this. The graph nodes can be represented as data from the different sensors, and the edges can display the influence of these data on each other. In this work, the possibility of applying graph neural networks to the problem of fault diagnosis in a chemical process is studied. It was proposed to construct a graph during the training of graph neural network. This allows to train models on data where the dependencies between the sensors are not known in advance. In this work, several methods for obtaining adjacency matrices were considered, as well as their quality was studied. It has also been proposed to use multiple adjacency matrices in one model. We showed state-of-the-art performance on the fault diagnosis task with the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset. The proposed graph neural networks outperformed the results of recurrent neural networks.

**Abstract:** Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in scenarios such as games and has emerged as a potential solution for control tasks. That is due to its ability to leverage scalability and handle complex dynamics. However, few works have targeted environments grounded in real-world settings. Indeed, real-world scenarios can be challenging, especially when faced with the high dimensionality of the state space and unknown reward function. We release a testbed consisting of an environment simulator and demonstrations of human operation concerning pump scheduling of a real-world water distribution facility to facilitate research. The pump scheduling problem can be viewed as a decision process to decide when to operate pumps to supply water while limiting electricity consumption and meeting system constraints. To provide a starting point, we release a well-documented codebase, present an overview of some challenges that can be addressed and provide a baseline representation of the problem. The code and dataset are available at https://gitlab.com/hdonancio/pumpscheduling.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly ubiquitous in numerous applications and systems, necessitating explanations of their predictions, especially when making critical decisions. However, explaining GNNs is challenging due to the complexity of graph data and model execution. Despite additional computational costs, post-hoc explanation approaches have been widely adopted due to the generality of their architectures. Intrinsically interpretable models provide instant explanations but are usually model-specific, which can only explain particular GNNs. Therefore, we propose a novel GNN explanation framework named SCALE, which is general and fast for explaining predictions. SCALE trains multiple specialty learners to explain GNNs since constructing one powerful explainer to examine attributions of interactions in input graphs is complicated. In training, a black-box GNN model guides learners based on an online knowledge distillation paradigm. In the explanation phase, explanations of predictions are provided by multiple explainers corresponding to trained learners. Specifically, edge masking and random walk with restart procedures are executed to provide structural explanations for graph-level and node-level predictions, respectively. A feature attribution module provides overall summaries and instance-level feature contributions. We compare SCALE with state-of-the-art baselines via quantitative and qualitative experiments to prove its explanation correctness and execution performance. We also conduct a series of ablation studies to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed framework.

**Abstract:** AUCMEDI is a Python-based framework for medical image classification. In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of AUCMEDI, by applying it to multiple datasets. Datasets were specifically chosen to cover a variety of medical disciplines and imaging modalities. We designed a simple pipeline using Jupyter notebooks and applied it to all datasets. Results show that AUCMEDI was able to train a model with accurate classification capabilities for each dataset: Averaged AUC per dataset range between 0.82 and 1.0, averaged F1 scores range between 0.61 and 1.0. With its high adaptability and strong performance, AUCMEDI proves to be a powerful instrument to build widely applicable neural networks. The notebooks serve as application examples for AUCMEDI.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate a novel problem of building contextual bandits in the vertical federated setting, i.e., contextual information is vertically distributed over different departments. This problem remains largely unexplored in the research community. To this end, we carefully design a customized encryption scheme named orthogonal matrix-based mask mechanism(O3M) for encrypting local contextual information while avoiding expensive conventional cryptographic techniques. We further apply the mechanism to two commonly-used bandit algorithms, LinUCB and LinTS, and instantiate two practical protocols for online recommendation under the vertical federated setting. The proposed protocols can perfectly recover the service quality of centralized bandit algorithms while achieving a satisfactory runtime efficiency, which is theoretically proved and analyzed in this paper. By conducting extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of privacy protection and recommendation performance.

**Abstract:** Causal discovery aims to recover causal structures generating the observational data. Despite its success in certain problems, in many real-world scenarios the observed variables are not the target variables of interest, but the imperfect measures of the target variables. Causal discovery under measurement error aims to recover the causal graph among unobserved target variables from observations made with measurement error. We consider a specific formulation of the problem, where the unobserved target variables follow a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, and the measurement process follows the random measurement error model. Existing methods on this formulation rely on non-scalable over-complete independent component analysis (OICA). In this work, we propose the Transformed Independent Noise (TIN) condition, which checks for independence between a specific linear transformation of some measured variables and certain other measured variables. By leveraging the non-Gaussianity and higher-order statistics of data, TIN is informative about the graph structure among the unobserved target variables. By utilizing TIN, the ordered group decomposition of the causal model is identifiable. In other words, we could achieve what once required OICA to achieve by only conducting independence tests. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of our method.

**Abstract:** Understanding and modelling children's cognitive processes and their behaviour in the context of their interaction with robots and social artificial intelligence systems is a fundamental prerequisite for meaningful and effective robot interventions. However, children's development involve complex faculties such as exploration, creativity and curiosity which are challenging to model. Also, often children express themselves in a playful way which is different from a typical adult behaviour. Different children also have different needs, and it remains a challenge in the current state of the art that those of neurodiverse children are under-addressed. With this workshop, we aim to promote a common ground among different disciplines such as developmental sciences, artificial intelligence and social robotics and discuss cutting-edge research in the area of user modelling and adaptive systems for children.

**Abstract:** Cameras capture sensor RAW images and transform them into pleasant RGB images, suitable for the human eyes, using their integrated Image Signal Processor (ISP). Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain (e.g. image denoising, white balance) due to its linear relationship with the scene irradiance, wide-range of information at 12bits, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public RGB datasets.
  This paper introduces the AIM 2022 Challenge on Reversed Image Signal Processing and RAW Reconstruction. We aim to recover raw sensor images from the corresponding RGBs without metadata and, by doing this, "reverse" the ISP transformation. The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for this low-level vision inverse problem, and generating realistic raw sensor readings can potentially benefit other tasks such as denoising and super-resolution.

**Abstract:** A confidence sequence (CS) is an anytime-valid sequential inference primitive which produces an adapted sequence of sets for a predictable parameter sequence with a time-uniform coverage guarantee. This work constructs a non-parametric non-asymptotic lower CS for the running average conditional expectation whose slack converges to zero given non-negative right heavy-tailed observations with bounded mean. Specifically, when the variance is finite the approach dominates the empirical Bernstein supermartingale of Howard et. al.; with infinite variance, can adapt to a known or unknown $(1 + Î´)$-th moment bound; and can be efficiently approximated using a sublinear number of sufficient statistics. In certain cases this lower CS can be converted into a closed-interval CS whose width converges to zero, e.g., any bounded realization, or post contextual-bandit inference with bounded rewards and unbounded importance weights. A reference implementation and example simulations demonstrate the technique.

**Abstract:** Image super-resolution reconstruction is an important task in the field of image processing technology, which can restore low resolution image to high quality image with high resolution. In recent years, deep learning has been applied in the field of image super-resolution reconstruction. With the continuous development of deep neural network, the quality of the reconstructed images has been greatly improved, but the model complexity has also been increased. In this paper, we propose two lightweight models named as MSwinSR and UGSwinSR based on Swin Transformer. The most important structure in MSwinSR is called Multi-size Swin Transformer Block (MSTB), which mainly contains four parallel multi-head self-attention (MSA) blocks. UGSwinSR combines U-Net and GAN with Swin Transformer. Both of them can reduce the model complexity, but MSwinSR can reach a higher objective quality, while UGSwinSR can reach a higher perceptual quality. The experimental results demonstrate that MSwinSR increases PSNR by $\mathbf{0.07dB}$ compared with the state-of-the-art model SwinIR, while the number of parameters can reduced by $\mathbf{30.68\%}$, and the calculation cost can reduced by $\mathbf{9.936\%}$. UGSwinSR can effectively reduce the amount of calculation of the network, which can reduced by $\mathbf{90.92\%}$ compared with SwinIR.

**Abstract:** We introduce ObSynth, an interactive system leveraging the domain knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs) to help users design object models from high level natural language prompts. This is an example of specification reification, the process of taking a high-level, potentially vague specification and reifying it into a more concrete form. We evaluate ObSynth via a user study, leading to three key findings: first, object models designed using ObSynth are more detailed, showing that it often synthesizes fields users might have otherwise omitted. Second, a majority of objects, methods, and fields generated by ObSynth are kept by the user in the final object model, highlighting the quality of generated components. Third, ObSynth altered the workflow of participants: they focus on checking that synthesized components were correct rather than generating them from scratch, though ObSynth did not reduce the time participants took to generate object models.

**Abstract:** A cognitive radar is a constrained utility maximizer that adapts its sensing mode in response to a changing environment. If an adversary can estimate the utility function of a cognitive radar, it can determine the radar's sensing strategy and mitigate the radar performance via electronic countermeasures (ECM). This paper discusses how a cognitive radar can {\em hide} its strategy from an adversary that detects cognition. The radar does so by transmitting purposefully designed sub-optimal responses to spoof the adversary's Neyman-Pearson detector. We provide theoretical guarantees by ensuring the Type-I error probability of the adversary's detector exceeds a pre-defined level for a specified tolerance on the radar's performance loss. We illustrate our cognition masking scheme via numerical examples involving waveform adaptation and beam allocation. We show that small purposeful deviations from the optimal strategy of the radar confuse the adversary by significant amounts, thereby masking the radar's cognition. Our approach uses novel ideas from revealed preference in microeconomics and adversarial inverse reinforcement learning. Our proposed algorithms provide a principled approach for system-level electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) to mask the radar's cognition, i.e., hide the radar's strategy from an adversary. We also provide performance bounds for our cognition masking scheme when the adversary has misspecified measurements of the radar's response.

**Abstract:** Communication and computation are often viewed as separate tasks. This approach is very effective from the perspective of engineering as isolated optimizations can be performed. On the other hand, there are many cases where the main interest is a function of the local information at the devices instead of the local information itself. For such scenarios, information theoretical results show that harnessing the interference in a multiple-access channel for computation, i.e., over-the-air computation (OAC), can provide a significantly higher achievable computation rate than the one with the separation of communication and computation tasks. Besides, the gap between OAC and separation in terms of computation rate increases with more participating nodes. Given this motivation, in this study, we provide a comprehensive survey on practical OAC methods. After outlining fundamentals related to OAC, we discuss the available OAC schemes with their pros and cons. We then provide an overview of the enabling mechanisms and relevant metrics to achieve reliable computation in the wireless channel. Finally, we summarize the potential applications of OAC and point out some future directions.

**Abstract:** Policy Optimization (PO) algorithms have been proven particularly suited to handle the high-dimensionality of real-world continuous control tasks. In this context, Trust Region Policy Optimization methods represent a popular approach to stabilize the policy updates. These usually rely on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to limit the change in the policy. The Wasserstein distance represents a natural alternative, in place of the KL divergence, to define trust regions or to regularize the objective function. However, state-of-the-art works either resort to its approximations or do not provide an algorithm for continuous state-action spaces, reducing the applicability of the method. In this paper, we explore optimal transport discrepancies (which include the Wasserstein distance) to define trust regions, and we propose a novel algorithm - Optimal Transport Trust Region Policy Optimization (OT-TRPO) - for continuous state-action spaces. We circumvent the infinite-dimensional optimization problem for PO by providing a one-dimensional dual reformulation for which strong duality holds. We then analytically derive the optimal policy update given the solution of the dual problem. This way, we bypass the computation of optimal transport costs and of optimal transport maps, which we implicitly characterize by solving the dual formulation. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our approach across various control tasks. Our results show that optimal transport discrepancies can offer an advantage over state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** Registration of pre-operative and follow-up brain MRI scans is challenging due to the large variation of tissue appearance and missing correspondences in tumour recurrence regions caused by tumour mass effect. Although recent deep learning-based deformable registration methods have achieved remarkable success in various medical applications, most of them are not capable of registering images with pathologies. In this paper, we propose a 3-step registration pipeline for pre-operative and follow-up brain MRI scans that consists of 1) a multi-level affine registration, 2) a conditional deep Laplacian pyramid image registration network (cLapIRN) with forward-backward consistency constraint, and 3) a non-linear instance optimization method. We apply the method to the Brain Tumor Sequence Registration (BraTS-Reg) Challenge. Our method achieves accurate and robust registration of brain MRI scans with pathologies, which achieves a median absolute error of 1.64 mm and 88% of successful registration rate in the validation set of BraTS-Reg challenge.

**Abstract:** Scaling language models improves performance but comes with significant computational costs. This paper proposes UL2R, a method that substantially improves existing language models and their scaling curves with a relatively tiny amount of extra compute. The key idea is to continue training a state-of-the-art large language model (e.g., PaLM) on a few more steps with UL2's mixture-of-denoiser objective. We show that, with almost negligible extra computational costs and no new sources of data, we are able to substantially improve the scaling properties of large language models on downstream metrics. In this paper, we continue training PaLM with UL2R, introducing a new set of models at 8B, 62B, and 540B scale which we call U-PaLM. Impressively, at 540B scale, we show an approximately 2x computational savings rate where U-PaLM achieves the same performance as the final PaLM 540B model at around half its computational budget (i.e., saving $\sim$4.4 million TPUv4 hours). We further show that this improved scaling curve leads to 'emergent abilities' on challenging BIG-Bench tasks -- for instance, U-PaLM does much better than PaLM on some tasks or demonstrates better quality at much smaller scale (62B as opposed to 540B). Overall, we show that U-PaLM outperforms PaLM on many few-shot setups, i.e., English NLP tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, question answering), reasoning tasks with chain-of-thought (e.g., GSM8K), multilingual tasks (MGSM, TydiQA), MMLU and challenging BIG-Bench tasks. Finally, we provide qualitative examples showing the new capabilities of U-PaLM for single and multi-span infilling.

**Abstract:** Two-stage robust optimization problems constitute one of the hardest optimization problem classes. One of the solution approaches to this class of problems is $K$-adaptability. This approach simultaneously seeks the best partitioning of the uncertainty set of scenarios into $K$ subsets, and optimizes decisions corresponding to each of these subsets. In general case, it is solved using the $K$-adaptability branch-and-bound algorithm, which requires exploration of exponentially-growing solution trees. To accelerate finding high-quality solutions in such trees, we propose a machine learning-based node selection strategy. In particular, we construct a feature engineering scheme based on general two-stage robust optimization insights that allows us to train our machine learning tool on a database of resolved B\&B trees, and to apply it as-is to problems of different sizes and/or types. We experimentally show that using our learned node selection strategy outperforms a vanilla, random node selection strategy when tested on problems of the same type as the training problems, also in case the $K$-value or the problem size differs from the training ones.
