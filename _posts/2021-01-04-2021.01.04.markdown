**Abstract:** Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.

**Abstract:** In physical science, sensor data are collected over time to produce timeseries data. However, depending on the real-world condition and underlying physics of the sensor, data might be noisy. Besides, the limitation of sample-time on sensors may not allow collecting data over all the timepoints, may require some form of interpolation. Interpolation may not be smooth enough, fail to denoise data, and derivative operation on noisy sensor data may be poor that do not reveal any high order dynamics. In this article, we propose to use AutoEncoder to perform interpolation that also denoise data simultaneously. A brief example using a real-world is also provided.

**Abstract:** Embedding static graphs in low-dimensional vector spaces plays a key role in network analytics and inference, supporting applications like node classification, link prediction, and graph visualization. However, many real-world networks present dynamic behavior, including topological evolution, feature evolution, and diffusion. Therefore, several methods for embedding dynamic graphs have been proposed to learn network representations over time, facing novel challenges, such as time-domain modeling, temporal features to be captured, and the temporal granularity to be embedded. In this survey, we overview dynamic graph embedding, discussing its fundamentals and the recent advances developed so far. We introduce the formal definition of dynamic graph embedding, focusing on the problem setting and introducing a novel taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding input and output. We further explore different dynamic behaviors that may be encompassed by embeddings, classifying by topological evolution, feature evolution, and processes on networks. Afterward, we describe existing techniques and propose a taxonomy for dynamic graph embedding techniques based on algorithmic approaches, from matrix and tensor factorization to deep learning, random walks, and temporal point processes. We also elucidate main applications, including dynamic link prediction, anomaly detection, and diffusion prediction, and we further state some promising research directions in the area.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a model for semantic memory that allows machines to collect information and experiences to become more proficient with time. Post semantic analysis of the sensory and other related data, the processed information is stored in the knowledge graph which is then used to comprehend the work instructions expressed in natural language. This imparts industrial robots cognitive behavior to execute the required tasks in a deterministic manner. The paper outlines the architecture of the system along with an implementation of the proposal.

**Abstract:** We investigate large-scale latent variable models (LVMs) for neural story generation -- an under-explored application for open-domain long text -- with objectives in two threads: generation effectiveness and controllability. LVMs, especially the variational autoencoder (VAE), have achieved both effective and controllable generation through exploiting flexible distributional latent representations. Recently, Transformers and its variants have achieved remarkable effectiveness without explicit latent representation learning, thus lack satisfying controllability in generation. In this paper, we advocate to revive latent variable modeling, essentially the power of representation learning, in the era of Transformers to enhance controllability without hurting state-of-the-art generation effectiveness. Specifically, we integrate latent representation vectors with a Transformer-based pre-trained architecture to build conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Model components such as encoder, decoder and the variational posterior are all built on top of pre-trained language models -- GPT2 specifically in this paper. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art conditional generation ability of our model, as well as its excellent representation learning capability and controllability.

**Abstract:** The record-breaking performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) comes with heavy parameterization, leading to external dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) for storage. The prohibitive energy of DRAM accesses makes it non-trivial to deploy DNN on resource-constrained devices, calling for minimizing the weight and data movements to improve the energy efficiency. We present SmartDeal (SD), an algorithm framework to trade higher-cost memory storage/access for lower-cost computation, in order to aggressively boost the storage and energy efficiency, for both inference and training. The core of SD is a novel weight decomposition with structural constraints, carefully crafted to unleash the hardware efficiency potential. Specifically, we decompose each weight tensor as the product of a small basis matrix and a large structurally sparse coefficient matrix whose non-zeros are quantized to power-of-2. The resulting sparse and quantized DNNs enjoy greatly reduced energy for data movement and weight storage, incurring minimal overhead to recover the original weights thanks to the sparse bit-operations and cost-favorable computations. Beyond inference, we take another leap to embrace energy-efficient training, introducing innovative techniques to address the unique roadblocks arising in training while preserving the SD structures. We also design a dedicated hardware accelerator to fully utilize the SD structure to improve the real energy efficiency and latency. We conduct experiments on both multiple tasks, models and datasets in different settings. Results show that: 1) applied to inference, SD achieves up to 2.44x energy efficiency as evaluated via real hardware implementations; 2) applied to training, SD leads to 10.56x and 4.48x reduction in the storage and training energy, with negligible accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art training baselines. Our source codes are available online.

**Abstract:** Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been rapidly adopted by smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to their powerful decision-making capabilities. However, they are vulnerable to various security and reliability threats, at both hardware and software levels, that compromise their accuracy. These threats get aggravated in emerging edge ML devices that have stringent constraints in terms of resources (e.g., compute, memory, power/energy), and that therefore cannot employ costly security and reliability measures. Security, reliability, and vulnerability mitigation techniques span from network security measures to hardware protection, with an increased interest towards formal verification of trained ML models.
  This paper summarizes the prominent vulnerabilities of modern ML systems, highlights successful defenses and mitigation techniques against these vulnerabilities, both at the cloud (i.e., during the ML training phase) and edge (i.e., during the ML inference stage), discusses the implications of a resource-constrained design on the reliability and security of the system, identifies verification methodologies to ensure correct system behavior, and describes open research challenges for building secure and reliable ML systems at both the edge and the cloud.

**Abstract:** The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has exposed many flaws in the decision-making strategies used to distribute resources to combat global health crises. In this paper, we leverage reinforcement learning and optimization to improve upon the allocation strategies for various resources. In particular, we consider a problem where a central controller must decide where to send testing kits to learn about the uncertain states of the world (active learning); then, use the new information to construct beliefs about the states and decide where to allocate resources. We propose a general model coupled with a tunable lookahead policy for making vaccine allocation decisions without perfect knowledge about the state of the world. The lookahead policy is compared to a population-based myopic policy which is more likely to be similar to the present strategies in practice. Each vaccine allocation policy works in conjunction with a testing kit allocation policy to perform active learning. Our simulation results demonstrate that an optimization-based lookahead decision making strategy will outperform the presented myopic policy.

**Abstract:** Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world and affects nearly 10 percent of the global adult population. Fortunately, powerful new technologies allow for a consistent and reliable treatment plan for people with diabetes. One major development is a system called continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM). In this review, we look at three different continuous meal detection algorithms that were developed using given CGM data from patients with diabetes. From this analysis, an initial meal prediction algorithm was also developed utilizing these methods.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been increasingly used in the implementation of advanced Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Research demonstrated the potential usefulness of AI-powered CDSS (AI-CDSS) in clinical decision making scenarios. However, post-adoption user perception and experience remain understudied, especially in developing countries. Through observations and interviews with 22 clinicians from 6 rural clinics in China, this paper reports the various tensions between the design of an AI-CDSS system ("Brilliant Doctor") and the rural clinical context, such as the misalignment with local context and workflow, the technical limitations and usability barriers, as well as issues related to transparency and trustworthiness of AI-CDSS. Despite these tensions, all participants expressed positive attitudes toward the future of AI-CDSS, especially acting as "a doctor's AI assistant" to realize a Human-AI Collaboration future in clinical settings. Finally we draw on our findings to discuss implications for designing AI-CDSS interventions for rural clinical contexts in developing countries.

**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an arrange of two neural networks -- the generator and the discriminator -- that are jointly trained to generate artificial data, such as images, from random inputs. The quality of these generated images has recently reached such levels that can often lead both machines and humans into mistaking fake for real examples. However, the process performed by the generator of the GAN has some limitations when we want to condition the network to generate images from subcategories of a specific class. Some recent approaches tackle this \textit{conditional generation} by introducing extra information prior to the training process, such as image semantic segmentation or textual descriptions. While successful, these techniques still require defining beforehand the desired subcategories and collecting large labeled image datasets representing them to train the GAN from scratch. In this paper we present a novel and alternative method for guiding generic non-conditional GANs to behave as conditional GANs. Instead of re-training the GAN, our approach adds into the mix an encoder network to generate the high-dimensional random input vectors that are fed to the generator network of a non-conditional GAN to make it generate images from a specific subcategory. In our experiments, when compared to training a conditional GAN from scratch, our guided GAN is able to generate artificial images of perceived quality comparable to that of non-conditional GANs after training the encoder on just a few hundreds of images, which substantially accelerates the process and enables adding new subcategories seamlessly.

**Abstract:** Membership inference (MI) attacks affect user privacy by inferring whether given data samples have been used to train a target learning model, e.g., a deep neural network. There are two types of MI attacks in the literature, i.e., these with and without shadow models. The success of the former heavily depends on the quality of the shadow model, i.e., the transferability between the shadow and the target; the latter, given only blackbox probing access to the target model, cannot make an effective inference of unknowns, compared with MI attacks using shadow models, due to the insufficient number of qualified samples labeled with ground truth membership information.
  In this paper, we propose an MI attack, called BlindMI, which probes the target model and extracts membership semantics via a novel approach, called differential comparison. The high-level idea is that BlindMI first generates a dataset with nonmembers via transforming existing samples into new samples, and then differentially moves samples from a target dataset to the generated, non-member set in an iterative manner. If the differential move of a sample increases the set distance, BlindMI considers the sample as non-member and vice versa.
  BlindMI was evaluated by comparing it with state-of-the-art MI attack algorithms. Our evaluation shows that BlindMI improves F1-score by nearly 20% when compared to state-of-the-art on some datasets, such as Purchase-50 and Birds-200, in the blind setting where the adversary does not know the target model's architecture and the target dataset's ground truth labels. We also show that BlindMI can defeat state-of-the-art defenses.

**Abstract:** A key component of deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) is word embeddings. Word embeddings that effectively capture the meaning and context of the word that they represent can significantly improve the performance of downstream DL models for various NLP tasks. Many existing word embeddings techniques capture the context of words based on word co-occurrence in documents and text; however, they often cannot capture broader domain-specific relationships between concepts that may be crucial for the NLP task at hand. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate external knowledge from medical terminology ontologies into the context captured by word embeddings. Specifically, we use a medical knowledge graph, such as the unified medical language system (UMLS), to find connections between clinical terms in cancer pathology reports. This approach aims to minimize the distance between connected clinical concepts. We evaluate the proposed approach using a Multitask Convolutional Neural Network (MT-CNN) to extract six cancer characteristics -- site, subsite, laterality, behavior, histology, and grade -- from a dataset of ~900K cancer pathology reports. The results show that the MT-CNN model which uses our domain informed embeddings outperforms the same MT-CNN using standard word2vec embeddings across all tasks, with an improvement in the overall micro- and macro-F1 scores by 4.97\%and 22.5\%, respectively.

**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves three fundamental subtasks: aspect term extraction, opinion term extraction, and aspect-level sentiment classification. Early works only focused on solving one of these subtasks individually. Some recent work focused on solving a combination of two subtasks, e.g., extracting aspect terms along with sentiment polarities or extracting the aspect and opinion terms pair-wisely. More recently, the triple extraction task has been proposed, i.e., extracting the (aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) triples from a sentence. However, previous approaches fail to solve all subtasks in a unified end-to-end framework. In this paper, we propose a complete solution for ABSA. We construct two machine reading comprehension (MRC) problems and solve all subtasks by joint training two BERT-MRC models with parameters sharing. We conduct experiments on these subtasks, and results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for person Re-Identification (Re-ID) rely on target domain samples to model the marginal distribution of the data. To deal with the lack of target domain labels, UDA methods leverage information from labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples. A promising approach relies on the use of unsupervised learning as part of the pipeline, such as clustering methods. The quality of the clusters clearly plays a major role in methods performance, but this point has been overlooked. In this work, we propose a multi-step pseudo-label refinement method to select the best possible clusters and keep improving them so that these clusters become closer to the class divisions without knowledge of the class labels. Our refinement method includes a cluster selection strategy and a camera-based normalization method which reduces the within-domain variations caused by the use of multiple cameras in person Re-ID. This allows our method to reach state-of-the-art UDA results on DukeMTMC-Market1501 (source-target). We surpass state-of-the-art for UDA Re-ID by 3.4% on Market1501-DukeMTMC datasets, which is a more challenging adaptation setup because the target domain (DukeMTMC) has eight distinct cameras. Furthermore, the camera-based normalization method causes a significant reduction in the number of iterations required for training convergence.

**Abstract:** Anomalous activity recognition deals with identifying the patterns and events that vary from the normal stream. In a surveillance paradigm, these events range from abuse to fighting and road accidents to snatching, etc. Due to the sparse occurrence of anomalous events, anomalous activity recognition from surveillance videos is a challenging research task. The approaches reported can be generally categorized as handcrafted and deep learning-based. Most of the reported studies address binary classification i.e. anomaly detection from surveillance videos. But these reported approaches did not address other anomalous events e.g. abuse, fight, road accidents, shooting, stealing, vandalism, and robbery, etc. from surveillance videos. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an effective framework for the recognition of different real-world anomalies from videos. This study provides a simple, yet effective approach for learning spatiotemporal features using deep 3-dimensional convolutional networks (3D ConvNets) trained on the University of Central Florida (UCF) Crime video dataset. Firstly, the frame-level labels of the UCF Crime dataset are provided, and then to extract anomalous spatiotemporal features more efficiently a fine-tuned 3D ConvNets is proposed. Findings of the proposed study are twofold 1)There exist specific, detectable, and quantifiable features in UCF Crime video feed that associate with each other 2) Multiclass learning can improve generalizing competencies of the 3D ConvNets by effectively learning frame-level information of dataset and can be leveraged in terms of better results by applying spatial augmentation.

**Abstract:** To date, the privacy-protection intended pixelation tasks are still labor-intensive and yet to be studied. With the prevailing of video live streaming, establishing an online face pixelation mechanism during streaming is an urgency. In this paper, we develop a new method called Face Pixelation in Video Live Streaming (FPVLS) to generate automatic personal privacy filtering during unconstrained streaming activities. Simply applying multi-face trackers will encounter problems in target drifting, computing efficiency, and over-pixelation. Therefore, for fast and accurate pixelation of irrelevant people's faces, FPVLS is organized in a frame-to-video structure of two core stages. On individual frames, FPVLS utilizes image-based face detection and embedding networks to yield face vectors. In the raw trajectories generation stage, the proposed Positioned Incremental Affinity Propagation (PIAP) clustering algorithm leverages face vectors and positioned information to quickly associate the same person's faces across frames. Such frame-wise accumulated raw trajectories are likely to be intermittent and unreliable on video level. Hence, we further introduce the trajectory refinement stage that merges a proposal network with the two-sample test based on the Empirical Likelihood Ratio (ELR) statistic to refine the raw trajectories. A Gaussian filter is laid on the refined trajectories for final pixelation. On the video live streaming dataset we collected, FPVLS obtains satisfying accuracy, real-time efficiency, and contains the over-pixelation problems.

**Abstract:** Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) lays a new paradigm for the concept of Industry 4.0 and paves an insight for new industrial era. Nowadays smart machines and smart factories use machine learning/deep learning based models for incurring intelligence. However, storing and communicating the data to the cloud and end device leads to issues in preserving privacy. In order to address this issue, federated learning (FL) technology is implemented in IIoT by the researchers nowadays to provide safe, accurate, robust and unbiased models. Integrating FL in IIoT ensures that no local sensitive data is exchanged, as the distribution of learning models over the edge devices has become more common with FL. Therefore, only the encrypted notifications and parameters are communicated to the central server. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on integrating FL with IIoT in terms of privacy, resource and data management. The survey starts by articulating IIoT characteristics and fundamentals of distributive and FL. The motivation behind integrating IIoT and FL for achieving data privacy preservation and on-device learning are summarized. Then we discuss the potential of using machine learning, deep learning and blockchain techniques for FL in secure IIoT. Further we analyze and summarize the ways to handle the heterogeneous and huge data. Comprehensive background on data and resource management are then presented, followed by applications of IIoT with FL in healthcare and automobile industry. Finally, we shed light on challenges, some possible solutions and potential directions for future research.

**Abstract:** Chatbots systems, despite their popularity in today's HCI and CSCW research, fall short for one of the two reasons: 1) many of the systems use a rule-based dialog flow, thus they can only respond to a limited number of pre-defined inputs with pre-scripted responses; or 2) they are designed with a focus on single-user scenarios, thus it is unclear how these systems may affect other users or the community. In this paper, we develop a generalizable chatbot architecture (CASS) to provide social support for community members in an online health community. The CASS architecture is based on advanced neural network algorithms, thus it can handle new inputs from users and generate a variety of responses to them. CASS is also generalizable as it can be easily migrate to other online communities. With a follow-up field experiment, CASS is proven useful in supporting individual members who seek emotional support. Our work also contributes to fill the research gap on how a chatbot may influence the whole community's engagement.

**Abstract:** We consider a one-hidden-layer leaky ReLU network of arbitrary width trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) following an arbitrary initialization. We prove that SGD produces neural networks that have classification accuracy competitive with that of the best halfspace over the distribution for a broad class of distributions that includes log-concave isotropic and hard margin distributions. Equivalently, such networks can generalize when the data distribution is linearly separable but corrupted with adversarial label noise, despite the capacity to overfit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show that overparameterized neural networks trained by SGD can generalize when the data is corrupted with adversarial label noise.

**Abstract:** Machine Learning has been applied in a wide range of tasks throughout the last years, ranging from image classification to autonomous driving and natural language processing. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) has received recent attention and relies on an energy-based structure to model data probability distributions. Notwithstanding, such a technique is susceptible to adversarial manipulation, i.e., slightly or profoundly modified data. An alternative to overcome the adversarial problem lies in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), capable of modeling data distributions and generating adversarial data that resemble the original ones. Therefore, this work proposes to artificially generate RBMs using Adversarial Learning, where pre-trained weight matrices serve as the GAN inputs. Furthermore, it proposes to sample copious amounts of matrices and combine them into ensembles, alleviating the burden of training new models'. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach under image reconstruction and image classification tasks, and describe how artificial-based ensembles are alternatives to pre-training vast amounts of RBMs.

**Abstract:** Existing malware detection approaches suffer from a simplistic trade-off between false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) due to a single tier classification approach, where the two measures adversely affect one another. The practical implication for malware detection is that FPR must be kept at an acceptably low level while TPR remains high. To this end, we propose a two-tiered learning, called ``Echelon", from raw byte data with no need for hand-crafted features. The first tier locks FPR at a specified target level, whereas the second tier improves TPR while maintaining the locked FPR. The core of Echelon lies at extracting activation information of the hidden layers of first tier model for constructing a stronger second tier model. Echelon is a framework in that it allows any existing CNN based model to be adapted in both tiers. We present experimental results of evaluating Echelon by adapting the state-of-the-art malware detection model ``Malconv" in the first and second tiers.

**Abstract:** Reading and writing research papers is one of the most privileged abilities that a qualified researcher should master. However, it is difficult for new researchers (\eg{students}) to fully {grasp} this ability. It would be fascinating if we could train an intelligent agent to help people read and summarize papers, and perhaps even discover and exploit the potential knowledge clues to write novel papers. Although there have been existing works focusing on summarizing (\emph{i.e.}, reading) the knowledge in a given text or generating (\emph{i.e.}, writing) a text based on the given knowledge, the ability of simultaneously reading and writing is still under development. Typically, this requires an agent to fully understand the knowledge from the given text materials and generate correct and fluent novel paragraphs, which is very challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a Deep ReAder-Writer (DRAW) network, which consists of a \textit{Reader} that can extract knowledge graphs (KGs) from input paragraphs and discover potential knowledge, a graph-to-text \textit{Writer} that generates a novel paragraph, and a \textit{Reviewer} that reviews the generated paragraph from three different aspects. Extensive experiments show that our DRAW network outperforms considered baselines and several state-of-the-art methods on AGENDA and M-AGENDA datasets. Our code and supplementary are released at https://github.com/menggehe/DRAW.

**Abstract:** Large-scale pretrained language models have shown thrilling generation capabilities, especially when they generate consistent long text in thousands of words with ease. However, users of these models can only control the prefix of sentences or certain global aspects of generated text. It is challenging to simultaneously achieve fine-grained controllability and preserve the state-of-the-art unconditional text generation capability. In this paper, we first propose a new task named "Outline to Story" (O2S) as a test bed for fine-grained controllable generation of long text, which generates a multi-paragraph story from cascaded events, i.e. a sequence of outline events that guide subsequent paragraph generation. We then create dedicate datasets for future benchmarks, built by state-of-the-art keyword extraction techniques. Finally, we propose an extremely simple yet strong baseline method for the O2S task, which fine tunes pre-trained language models on augmented sequences of outline-story pairs with simple language modeling objective. Our method does not introduce any new parameters or perform any architecture modification, except several special tokens as delimiters to build augmented sequences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art conditional story generation performance with our model, achieving better fine-grained controllability and user flexibility. Our paper is among the first ones by our knowledge to propose a model and to create datasets for the task of "outline to story". Our work also instantiates research interest of fine-grained controllable generation of open-domain long text, where controlling inputs are represented by short text.

**Abstract:** Following the recent initiatives for the democratization of AI, deep fake generators have become increasingly popular and accessible, causing dystopian scenarios towards social erosion of trust. A particular domain, such as biological signals, attracted attention towards detection methods that are capable of exploiting authenticity signatures in real videos that are not yet faked by generative approaches. In this paper, we first propose several prominent eye and gaze features that deep fakes exhibit differently. Second, we compile those features into signatures and analyze and compare those of real and fake videos, formulating geometric, visual, metric, temporal, and spectral variations. Third, we generalize this formulation to the deep fake detection problem by a deep neural network, to classify any video in the wild as fake or real. We evaluate our approach on several deep fake datasets, achieving 92.48% accuracy on FaceForensics++, 80.0% on Deep Fakes (in the wild), 88.35% on CelebDF, and 99.27% on DeeperForensics datasets. Our approach outperforms most deep and biological fake detectors with complex network architectures without the proposed gaze signatures. We conduct ablation studies involving different features, architectures, sequence durations, and post-processing artifacts.

**Abstract:** We show that the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) formulation of Arjovsky et al. (2019) can fail to capture "natural" invariances, at least when used in its practical "linear" form, and even on very simple problems which directly follow the motivating examples for IRM. This can lead to worse generalization on new environments, even when compared to unconstrained ERM. The issue stems from a significant gap between the linear variant (as in their concrete method IRMv1) and the full non-linear IRM formulation. Additionally, even when capturing the "right" invariances, we show that it is possible for IRM to learn a sub-optimal predictor, due to the loss function not being invariant across environments. The issues arise even when measuring invariance on the population distributions, but are exacerbated by the fact that IRM is extremely fragile to sampling.

**Abstract:** In the social media, there are a large amount of potential zombie accounts which may has negative impact on the public opinion. In tradition, PageRank algorithm is used to detect zombie accounts. However, problems such as it requires a large RAM to store adjacent matrix or adjacent list and the value of importance may approximately to zero for large graph exist. To solve the first problem, since the structure of social media makes the graph divisible, we conducted a community detection algorithm Louvain to decompose the whole graph into 1,002 subgraphs. The modularity of 0.58 shows the result is effective. To solve the second problem, we performed the uneven assignation PageRank algorithm to calculate the importance of node in each community. Then, a threshold is set to distinguish the zombie account and normal accounts. The result shows that about 20% accounts in the dataset are zombie accounts and they center in tier-one cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In the future, a classification algorithm with semi-supervised learning can be used to detect zombie accounts.

**Abstract:** What is the creative process through which an artist goes from an original image to a painting? Can we examine this process using techniques from computer vision and pattern recognition? Here we set the first preliminary steps to algorithmically deconstruct some of the transformations that an artist applies to an original image in order to establish centres of interest, which are focal areas of a painting that carry meaning. We introduce a comparative methodology that first cuts out the minimal segment from the original image on which the painting is based, then aligns the painting with this source, investigates micro-differences to identify centres of interest and attempts to understand their role. In this paper we focus exclusively on micro-differences with respect to edges. We believe that research into where and how artists create centres of interest in paintings is valuable for curators, art historians, viewers, and art educators, and might even help artists to understand and refine their own artistic method.

**Abstract:** The Multi-armed bandit offer the advantage to learn and exploit the already learnt knowledge at the same time. This capability allows this approach to be applied in different domains, going from clinical trials where the goal is investigating the effects of different experimental treatments while minimizing patient losses, to adaptive routing where the goal is to minimize the delays in a network. This article provides a review of the recent results on applying bandit to real-life scenario and summarize the state of the art for each of these fields. Different techniques has been proposed to solve this problem setting, like epsilon-greedy, Upper confident bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling (TS). We are showing here how this algorithms were adapted to solve the different problems of exploration exploitation.

**Abstract:** Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is used to predict the dynamic motion path of a moving platform based on the location coordinates and the precise mapping of the physical environment. SLAM has great potential in augmented reality (AR), autonomous vehicles, viz. self-driving cars, drones, Autonomous navigation robots (ANR). This work introduces a hybrid learning model that explores beyond feature fusion and conducts a multimodal weight sewing strategy towards improving the performance of a baseline SLAM algorithm. It carries out weight enhancement of the front end feature extractor of the SLAM via mutation of different deep networks' top layers. At the same time, the trajectory predictions from independently trained models are amalgamated to refine the location detail. Thus, the integration of the aforesaid early and late fusion techniques under a hybrid learning framework minimizes the translation and rotation errors of the SLAM model. This study exploits some well-known deep learning (DL) architectures, including ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, VGG19, and AlexNet for experimental analysis. An extensive experimental analysis proves that hybrid learner (HL) achieves significantly better results than the unimodal approaches and multimodal approaches with early or late fusion strategies. Hence, it is found that the Apolloscape dataset taken in this work has never been used in the literature under SLAM with fusion techniques, which makes this work unique and insightful.

**Abstract:** Efficient and accurate object detection in video and image analysis is one of the major beneficiaries of the advancement in computer vision systems with the help of deep learning. With the aid of deep learning, more powerful tools evolved, which are capable to learn high-level and deeper features and thus can overcome the existing problems in traditional architectures of object detection algorithms. The work in this thesis aims to achieve high accuracy in object detection with good real-time performance.
  In the area of computer vision, a lot of research is going into the area of detection and processing of visual information, by improving the existing algorithms. The binarized neural network has shown high performance in various vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST), Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and Street View House Numbers (SVHN) datasets are used which is implemented using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that is 22 layers deep. Supervised learning is used in the work, which classifies the particular dataset with the proper structure of the model. In still images, to improve accuracy, Googlenet is used. The final layer of the Googlenet is replaced with the transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the Googlenet. At the same time, the accuracy in moving images can be maintained by transfer learning techniques. Hardware is the main backbone for any model to obtain faster results with a large number of datasets. Here, Nvidia Jetson Nano is used which is a graphics processing unit (GPU), that can handle a large number of computations in the process of object detection. Results show that the accuracy of objects detected by the transfer learning method is more when compared to the existing methods.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of inferring communication structures that can solve cooperative multi-agent planning problems while minimizing the amount of communication. We quantify the amount of communication as the maximum degree of the communication graph; this metric captures settings where agents have limited bandwidth. Minimizing communication is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of both the decision space and the objective; for instance, we cannot solve this problem by training neural networks using gradient descent. We propose a novel algorithm that synthesizes a control policy that combines a programmatic communication policy used to generate the communication graph with a transformer policy network used to choose actions. Our algorithm first trains the transformer policy, which implicitly generates a "soft" communication graph; then, it synthesizes a programmatic communication policy that "hardens" this graph, forming a neurosymbolic transformer. Our experiments demonstrate how our approach can synthesize policies that generate low-degree communication graphs while maintaining near-optimal performance.

**Abstract:** This work addresses adversarial robustness in deep learning by considering deep networks with stochastic local winner-takes-all (LWTA) activations. This type of network units result in sparse representations from each model layer, as the units are organized in blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The main operating principle of the introduced units lies on stochastic arguments, as the network performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the winner. We combine these LWTA arguments with tools from the field of Bayesian non-parametrics, specifically the stick-breaking construction of the Indian Buffet Process, to allow for inferring the sub-part of each layer that is essential for modeling the data at hand. Then, inference is performed by means of stochastic variational Bayes. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of our model using benchmark datasets. As we show, our method achieves high robustness to adversarial perturbations, with state-of-the-art performance in powerful adversarial attack schemes.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks have threatened the application of deep neural networks in security-sensitive scenarios. Most existing black-box attacks fool the target model by interacting with it many times and producing global perturbations. However, global perturbations change the smooth and insignificant background, which not only makes the perturbation more easily be perceived but also increases the query overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to perturb the discriminative areas of clean examples only within limited queries in black-box attacks. Our framework is constructed based on two types of transferability. The first one is the transferability of model interpretations. Based on this property, we identify the discriminative areas of a given clean example easily for local perturbations. The second is the transferability of adversarial examples. It helps us to produce a local pre-perturbation for improving query efficiency. After identifying the discriminative areas and pre-perturbing, we generate the final adversarial examples from the pre-perturbed example by querying the targeted model with two kinds of black-box attack techniques, i.e., gradient estimation and random search. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our framework can significantly improve the query efficiency during black-box perturbing with a high attack success rate. Experimental results show that our attacks outperform state-of-the-art black-box attacks under various system settings.

**Abstract:** Differential privacy is a formal, mathematical definition of data privacy that has gained traction in academia, industry, and government. The task of correctly constructing differentially private algorithms is non-trivial, and mistakes have been made in foundational algorithms. Currently, there is no automated support for converting an existing, non-private program into a differentially private version. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically learning an accurate and differentially private version of a given non-private program. We show how to solve this difficult program synthesis problem via a combination of techniques: carefully picking representative example inputs, reducing the problem to continuous optimization, and mapping the results back to symbolic expressions. We demonstrate that our approach is able to learn foundational algorithms from the differential privacy literature and significantly outperforms natural program synthesis baselines.

**Abstract:** In this paper we study the adversarial combinatorial bandit with a known non-linear reward function, extending existing work on adversarial linear combinatorial bandit. {The adversarial combinatorial bandit with general non-linear reward is an important open problem in bandit literature, and it is still unclear whether there is a significant gap from the case of linear reward, stochastic bandit, or semi-bandit feedback.} We show that, with $N$ arms and subsets of $K$ arms being chosen at each of $T$ time periods, the minimax optimal regret is $\widetildeŒò_{d}(\sqrt{N^d T})$ if the reward function is a $d$-degree polynomial with $d< K$, and $Œò_K(\sqrt{N^K T})$ if the reward function is not a low-degree polynomial. {Both bounds are significantly different from the bound $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{poly}(N,K)T})$ for the linear case, which suggests that there is a fundamental gap between the linear and non-linear reward structures.} Our result also finds applications to adversarial assortment optimization problem in online recommendation. We show that in the worst-case of adversarial assortment problem, the optimal algorithm must treat each individual $\binom{N}{K}$ assortment as independent.

**Abstract:** We present a high-bandwidth, lightweight, and nonlinear output tracking technique for soft actuators that combines parsimonious recursive layers for forward output predictions and online optimization using Newton-Raphson. This technique allows for reduced model sizes and increased control loop frequencies when compared with conventional RNN models. Experimental results of this controller prototype on a single soft actuator with soft positional sensors indicate effective tracking of referenced spatial trajectories and rejection of mechanical and electromagnetic disturbances. These are evidenced by root mean squared path tracking errors (RMSE) of 1.8mm using a fully connected (FC) substructure, 1.62mm using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) and 2.11mm using a long short term memory (LSTM) unit, all averaged over three tasks. Among these models, the highest flash memory requirement is 2.22kB enabling co-location of controller and actuator.

**Abstract:** Gaussian processes provide a powerful probabilistic kernel learning framework, which allows learning high quality nonparametric regression models via methods such as Gaussian process regression. Nevertheless, the learning phase of Gaussian process regression requires massive computations which are not realistic for large datasets. In this paper, we present a Gauss-Legendre quadrature based approach for scaling up Gaussian process regression via a low rank approximation of the kernel matrix. We utilize the structure of the low rank approximation to achieve effective hyperparameter learning, training and prediction. Our method is very much inspired by the well-known random Fourier features approach, which also builds low-rank approximations via numerical integration. However, our method is capable of generating high quality approximation to the kernel using an amount of features which is poly-logarithmic in the number of training points, while similar guarantees will require an amount that is at the very least linear in the number of training points when random Fourier features. Furthermore, the structure of the low-rank approximation that our method builds is subtly different from the one generated by random Fourier features, and this enables much more efficient hyperparameter learning. The utility of our method for learning with low-dimensional datasets is demonstrated using numerical experiments.

**Abstract:** Computing Wasserstein barycenters (a.k.a. Optimal Transport barycenters) is a fundamental problem in geometry which has recently attracted considerable attention due to many applications in data science. While there exist polynomial-time algorithms in any fixed dimension, all known running times suffer exponentially in the dimension. It is an open question whether this exponential dependence is improvable to a polynomial dependence. This paper proves that unless P=NP, the answer is no. This uncovers a "curse of dimensionality" for Wasserstein barycenter computation which does not occur for Optimal Transport computation. Moreover, our hardness results for computing Wasserstein barycenters extend to approximate computation, to seemingly simple cases of the problem, and to averaging probability distributions in other Optimal Transport metrics.

**Abstract:** First-order methods for solving convex optimization problems have been at the forefront of mathematical optimization in the last 20 years. The rapid development of this important class of algorithms is motivated by the success stories reported in various applications, including most importantly machine learning, signal processing, imaging and control theory. First-order methods have the potential to provide low accuracy solutions at low computational complexity which makes them an attractive set of tools in large-scale optimization problems. In this survey we cover a number of key developments in gradient-based optimization methods. This includes non-Euclidean extensions of the classical proximal gradient method, and its accelerated versions. Additionally we survey recent developments within the class of projection-free methods, and proximal versions of primal-dual schemes. We give complete proofs for various key results, and highlight the unifying aspects of several optimization algorithms.

**Abstract:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is the workhorse tool for dimensionality reduction in this era of big data. While often overlooked, the purpose of PCA is not only to reduce data dimensionality, but also to yield features that are uncorrelated. Furthermore, the ever-increasing volume of data in the modern world often requires storage of data samples across multiple machines, which precludes the use of centralized PCA algorithms. This paper focuses on the dual objective of PCA, namely, dimensionality reduction and decorrelation of features, but in a distributed setting. This requires estimating the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix, as opposed to only estimating the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors, when data is distributed across a network of machines. Although a few distributed solutions to the PCA problem have been proposed recently, convergence guarantees and/or communications overhead of these solutions remain a concern. With an eye towards communications efficiency, this paper introduces a feedforward neural network-based one time-scale distributed PCA algorithm termed Distributed Sanger's Algorithm (DSA) that estimates the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix when data is distributed across an undirected and arbitrarily connected network of machines. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is shown to converge linearly to a neighborhood of the true solution. Numerical results are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution.

**Abstract:** Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) leverages distributed and non-dedicated sensing concepts by utilizing sensors imbedded in a large number of mobile smart devices. However, the openness and distributed nature of MCS leads to various vulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious user submitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume resources from any number of participants' devices; as well as attempting to clog the MCS server. In this paper, a novel approach that is based on horizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks that contain a number of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection devices are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a machine learning (ML) module, and an associated training dataset. Furthermore, the aggregation module collects the prediction results from individual devices and determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing the prediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect to misclassification, where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach where the risk is formulated as a function of the utility loss. Experimental results demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate task detection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection performance of the traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher performance of detection and lower loss of utility can be achieved by the proposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100%detection accuracy using small training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly over an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.

**Abstract:** The precision anticipated from next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys will create opportunities for characteristically new insights into cosmology. Secondary anisotropies of the CMB will have an increased importance in forthcoming surveys, due both to the cosmological information they encode and the role they play in obscuring our view of the primary fluctuations. Quadratic estimators have become the standard tools for reconstructing the fields that distort the primary CMB and produce secondary anisotropies. While successful for lensing reconstruction with current data, quadratic estimators will be sub-optimal for the reconstruction of lensing and other effects at the expected sensitivity of the upcoming CMB surveys. In this paper we describe a convolutional neural network, ResUNet-CMB, that is capable of the simultaneous reconstruction of two sources of secondary CMB anisotropies, gravitational lensing and patchy reionization. We show that the ResUNet-CMB network significantly outperforms the quadratic estimator at low noise levels and is not subject to the lensing-induced bias on the patchy reionization reconstruction that would be present with a straightforward application of the quadratic estimator.

**Abstract:** Aiming at the traditional grasping method for manipulators based on 2D camera, when faced with the scene of gathering or covering, it can hardly perform well in unstructured scenes that appear as gathering and covering, for the reason that can't recognize objects accurately in cluster scenes from a single perspective and the manipulators can't make the environment better for grasping. In this case, a novel method of pushing-grasping collaborative based on the deep Q-network in dual perspectives is proposed in this paper. This method adopts an improved deep Q network algorithm, with an RGB-D camera to obtain the information of objects' RGB images and point clouds from two perspectives, and combines the pushing and grasping actions so that the trained manipulator can make the scenes better for grasping so that it can perform well in more complicated grasping scenes. What's more, we improved the reward function of the deep Q-network and propose the piecewise reward function to speed up the convergence of the deep Q-network. We trained different models and tried different methods in the V-REP simulation environment, and it concluded that the method proposed in this paper converges quickly and the success rate of grasping objects in unstructured scenes raises up to 83.5%. Besides, it shows the generalization ability and well performance when novel objects appear in the scenes that the manipulator has never grasped before.

**Abstract:** Microarray technology is known as one of the most important tools for collecting DNA expression data. This technology allows researchers to investigate and examine types of diseases and their origins. However, microarray data are often associated with challenges such as small sample size, a significant number of genes, imbalanced data, etc. that make classification models inefficient. Thus, a new hybrid solution based on multi-filter and adaptive chaotic multi-objective forest optimization algorithm (AC-MOFOA) is presented to solve the gene selection problem and construct the Ensemble Classifier. In the proposed solution, to reduce the dataset's dimensions, a multi-filter model uses a combination of five filter methods to remove redundant and irrelevant genes. Then, an AC-MOFOA based on the concepts of non-dominated sorting, crowding distance, chaos theory, and adaptive operators is presented. AC-MOFOA as a wrapper method aimed at reducing dataset dimensions, optimizing KELM, and increasing the accuracy of the classification, simultaneously. Next, in this method, an ensemble classifier model is presented using AC-MOFOA results to classify microarray data. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on nine public microarray datasets, and its results were compared in terms of the number of selected genes, classification efficiency, execution time, time complexity, and hypervolume indicator criterion with five hybrid multi-objective methods. According to the results, the proposed hybrid method could increase the accuracy of the KELM in most datasets by reducing the dataset's dimensions and achieve similar or superior performance compared to other multi-objective methods. Furthermore, the proposed Ensemble Classifier model could provide better classification accuracy and generalizability in microarray data compared to conventional ensemble methods.

**Abstract:** It is suggested that low-light image enhancement realizes one-to-many mapping since we have different definitions of NORMAL-light given application scenarios or users' aesthetic. However, most existing methods ignore subjectivity of the task, and simply produce one result with fixed brightness. This paper proposes a neural network for multi-level low-light image enhancement, which is user-friendly to meet various requirements by selecting different images as brightness reference. Inspired by style transfer, our method decomposes an image into two low-coupling feature components in the latent space, which allows the concatenation feasibility of the content components from low-light images and the luminance components from reference images. In such a way, the network learns to extract scene-invariant and brightness-specific information from a set of image pairs instead of learning brightness differences. Moreover, information except for the brightness is preserved to the greatest extent to alleviate color distortion. Extensive results show strong capacity and superiority of our network against existing methods.

**Abstract:** Data privacy is an important issue for organizations and enterprises to securely outsource data storage, sharing, and computation on clouds / fogs. However, data encryption is complicated in terms of the key management and distribution; existing secure computation techniques are expensive in terms of computational / communication cost and therefore do not scale to big data computation. Tensor network decomposition and distributed tensor computation have been widely used in signal processing and machine learning for dimensionality reduction and large-scale optimization. However, the potential of distributed tensor networks for big data privacy preservation have not been considered before, this motivates the current study. Our primary intuition is that tensor network representations are mathematically non-unique, unlinkable, and uninterpretable; tensor network representations naturally support a range of multilinear operations for compressed and distributed / dispersed computation. Therefore, we propose randomized algorithms to decompose big data into randomized tensor network representations and analyze the privacy leakage for 1D to 3D data tensors. The randomness mainly comes from the complex structural information commonly found in big data; randomization is based on controlled perturbation applied to the tensor blocks prior to decomposition. The distributed tensor representations are dispersed on multiple clouds / fogs or servers / devices with metadata privacy, this provides both distributed trust and management to seamlessly secure big data storage, communication, sharing, and computation. Experiments show that the proposed randomization techniques are helpful for big data anonymization and efficient for big data storage and computation.

**Abstract:** The millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems with discrete lens arrays (DLA) have received great attention due to their simple hardware implementation and excellent performance. In this work, we investigate the joint design of beam selection and digital precoding matrices for mmWave MU-MIMO systems with DLA to maximize the sum-rate subject to the transmit power constraint and the constraints of the selection matrix structure. The investigated non-convex problem with discrete variables and coupled constraints is challenging to solve and an efficient framework of joint neural network (NN) design is proposed to tackle it. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based NN and a deep-unfolding NN, which are employed to optimize the beam selection and digital precoding matrices, respectively. As for the DRL-based NN, we formulate the beam selection problem as a Markov decision process and a double deep Q-network algorithm is developed to solve it. The base station is considered to be an agent, where the state, action, and reward function are carefully designed. Regarding the design of the digital precoding matrix, we develop an iterative weighted minimum mean-square error algorithm induced deep-unfolding NN, which unfolds this algorithm into a layerwise structure with introduced trainable parameters. Simulation results verify that this jointly trained NN remarkably outperforms the existing iterative algorithms with reduced complexity and stronger robustness.

**Abstract:** Control of the stochastic dynamics of a quantum system is indispensable in fields such as quantum information processing and metrology. However, there is no general ready-made approach to the design of efficient control strategies. Here, we propose a framework for the automated design of control schemes based on differentiable programming ($\partial \mathrm{P}$). We apply this approach to the state preparation and stabilization of a qubit subjected to homodyne detection. To this end, we formulate the control task as an optimization problem where the loss function quantifies the distance from the target state, and we employ neural networks (NNs) as controllers. The system's time evolution is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To implement efficient training, we backpropagate the gradient information from the loss function through the SDE solver using adjoint sensitivity methods. As a first example, we feed the quantum state to the controller and focus on different methods of obtaining gradients. As a second example, we directly feed the homodyne detection signal to the controller. The instantaneous value of the homodyne current contains only very limited information on the actual state of the system, masked by unavoidable photon-number fluctuations. Despite the resulting poor signal-to-noise ratio, we can train our controller to prepare and stabilize the qubit to a target state with a mean fidelity of around 85%. We also compare the solutions found by the NN to a hand-crafted control strategy.

Computational experiments show that they are competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics, notably on large instances.

**Abstract:** We present a methodology combining neural networks with physical principle constraints in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach allows to train neural networks while respecting the PDEs as a strong constraint in the optimisation as apposed to making them part of the loss function. The resulting models are discretised in space by the finite element method (FEM). The method applies to both stationary and transient as well as linear/nonlinear PDEs. We describe implementation of the approach as an extension of the existing FEM framework FEniCS and its algorithmic differentiation tool dolfin-adjoint. Through series of examples we demonstrate capabilities of the approach to recover coefficients and missing PDE operators from observations. Further, the proposed method is compared with alternative methodologies, namely, physics informed neural networks and standard PDE-constrained optimisation. Finally, we demonstrate the method on a complex cardiac cell model problem using deep neural networks.

**Abstract:** Multiple works have applied deep learning to fringe projection profilometry (FPP) in recent years. However, to obtain a large amount of data from actual systems for training is still a tricky problem, and moreover, the network design and optimization still worth exploring. In this paper, we introduce computer graphics to build virtual FPP systems in order to generate the desired datasets conveniently and simply. The way of constructing a virtual FPP system is described in detail firstly, and then some key factors to set the virtual FPP system much close to the reality are analyzed. With the aim of accurately estimating the depth image from only one fringe image, we also design a new loss function to enhance the quality of the overall and detailed information restored. And two representative networks, U-Net and pix2pix, are compared in multiple aspects. The real experiments prove the good accuracy and generalization of the network trained by the data from our virtual systems and the designed loss, implying the potential of our method for applications.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the L1/L2 minimization on the gradient for imaging applications. Several recent works have demonstrated that L1/L2 is better than the L1 norm when approximating the L0 norm to promote sparsity. Consequently, we postulate that applying L1/L2 on the gradient is better than the classic total variation (the L1 norm on the gradient) to enforce the sparsity of the image gradient. To verify our hypothesis, we consider a constrained formulation to reveal empirical evidence on the superiority of L1/L2 over L1 when recovering piecewise constant signals from low-frequency measurements. Numerically, we design a specific splitting scheme, under which we can prove subsequential and global convergence for the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) under certain conditions. Experimentally, we demonstrate visible improvements of L1/L2 over L1 and other nonconvex regularizations for image recovery from low-frequency measurements and two medical applications of MRI and CT reconstruction. All the numerical results show the efficiency of our proposed approach.

**Abstract:** Database indexes facilitate data retrieval and benefit broad applications in real-world systems. Recently, a new family of index, named learned index, is proposed to learn hidden yet useful data distribution and incorporate such information into the learning of indexes, which leads to promising performance improvements. However, the "learning" process of learned indexes is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a formal machine learning based framework to quantify the index learning objective, and study two general and pluggable techniques to enhance the learning efficiency and learning effectiveness for learned indexes. With the guidance of the formal learning objective, we can efficiently learn index by incorporating the proposed sampling technique, and learn precise index with enhanced generalization ability brought by the proposed result-driven gap insertion technique.
  We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and compare several indexing methods from the perspective of the index learning objective. The results show the ability of the proposed framework to help to design suitable indexes for different scenarios. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling technique, which achieves up to 78x construction speedup while maintaining non-degraded indexing performance. Finally, we show the gap insertion technique can enhance both the static and dynamic indexing performances of existing learned index methods with up to 1.59x query speedup. We will release our codes and processed data for further study, which can enable more exploration of learned indexes from both the perspectives of machine learning and database.

**Abstract:** The conventional federated learning (FedL) architecture distributes machine learning (ML) across worker devices by having them train local models that are periodically aggregated by a server. FedL ignores two important characteristics of contemporary wireless networks, however: (i) the network may contain heterogeneous communication/computation resources, while (ii) there may be significant overlaps in devices' local data distributions. In this work, we develop a novel optimization methodology that jointly accounts for these factors via intelligent device sampling complemented by device-to-device (D2D) offloading. Our optimization aims to select the best combination of sampled nodes and data offloading configuration to maximize FedL training accuracy subject to realistic constraints on the network topology and device capabilities. Theoretical analysis of the D2D offloading subproblem leads to new FedL convergence bounds and an efficient sequential convex optimizer. Using this result, we develop a sampling methodology based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) which learns the relationship between network attributes, sampled nodes, and resulting offloading that maximizes FedL accuracy. Through evaluation on real-world datasets and network measurements from our IoT testbed, we find that our methodology while sampling less than 5% of all devices outperforms conventional FedL substantially both in terms of trained model accuracy and required resource utilization.

**Abstract:** This paper primarily focuses on computing the Euclidean projection of a vector onto the $\ell_{p}$ ball in which $p\in(0,1)$. Such a problem emerges as the core building block in statistical machine learning and signal processing tasks because of its ability to promote sparsity. However, efficient numerical algorithms for finding the projections are still not available, particularly in large-scale optimization. To meet this challenge, we first derive the first-order necessary optimality conditions of this problem. Based on this characterization, we develop a novel numerical approach for computing the stationary point through solving a sequence of projections onto the reweighted $\ell_{1}$-balls. This method is practically simple to implement and computationally efficient. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to converge uniquely under mild conditions and has a worst-case $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

**Abstract:** Direct policy search serves as one of the workhorses in modern reinforcement learning (RL), and its applications in continuous control tasks have recently attracted increasing attention. In this work, we investigate the convergence theory of policy gradient (PG) methods for learning the linear risk-sensitive and robust controller. In particular, we develop PG methods that can be implemented in a derivative-free fashion by sampling system trajectories, and establish both global convergence and sample complexity results in the solutions of two fundamental settings in risk-sensitive and robust control: the finite-horizon linear exponential quadratic Gaussian, and the finite-horizon linear-quadratic disturbance attenuation problems. As a by-product, our results also provide the first sample complexity for the global convergence of PG methods on solving zero-sum linear-quadratic dynamic games, a nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem that serves as a baseline setting in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with continuous spaces. One feature of our algorithms is that during the learning phase, a certain level of robustness/risk-sensitivity of the controller is preserved, which we termed as the implicit regularization property, and is an essential requirement in safety-critical control systems.

**Abstract:** Attempt to fully discover the temporal diversity and chronological characteristics for self-supervised video representation learning, this work takes advantage of the temporal dependencies within videos and further proposes a novel self-supervised method named Temporal Contrastive Graph Learning (TCGL). In contrast to the existing methods that ignore modeling elaborate temporal dependencies, our TCGL roots in a hybrid graph contrastive learning strategy to jointly regard the inter-snippet and intra-snippet temporal dependencies as self-supervision signals for temporal representation learning. To model multi-scale temporal dependencies, our TCGL integrates the prior knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into graph structures, i.e., the intra-/inter- snippet temporal contrastive graphs. By randomly removing edges and masking nodes of the intra-snippet graphs or inter-snippet graphs, our TCGL can generate different correlated graph views. Then, specific contrastive learning modules are designed to maximize the agreement between nodes in different views. To adaptively learn the global context representation and recalibrate the channel-wise features, we introduce an adaptive video snippet order prediction module, which leverages the relational knowledge among video snippets to predict the actual snippet orders. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TCGL over the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks.
