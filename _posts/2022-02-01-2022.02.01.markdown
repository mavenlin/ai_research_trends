**Abstract:** Computer graphics has experienced a recent surge of data-centric approaches for photorealistic and controllable content creation. StyleGAN in particular sets new standards for generative modeling regarding image quality and controllability. However, StyleGAN's performance severely degrades on large unstructured datasets such as ImageNet. StyleGAN was designed for controllability; hence, prior works suspect its restrictive design to be unsuitable for diverse datasets. In contrast, we find the main limiting factor to be the current training strategy. Following the recently introduced Projected GAN paradigm, we leverage powerful neural network priors and a progressive growing strategy to successfully train the latest StyleGAN3 generator on ImageNet. Our final model, StyleGAN-XL, sets a new state-of-the-art on large-scale image synthesis and is the first to generate images at a resolution of $1024^2$ at such a dataset scale. We demonstrate that this model can invert and edit images beyond the narrow domain of portraits or specific object classes.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate that co-training (Blum & Mitchell, 1998) can improve the performance of prompt-based learning by using unlabeled data. While prompting has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot and zero-shot learning, it is often brittle and requires much larger models compared to the standard supervised setup. We find that co-training makes it possible to improve the original prompt model and at the same time learn a smaller, downstream task-specific model. In the case where we only have partial access to a prompt model (e.g., output probabilities from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)) we learn a calibration model over the prompt outputs. When we have full access to the prompt model's gradients but full finetuning remains prohibitively expensive (e.g., T0 (Sanh et al., 2021)), we learn a set of soft prompt continuous vectors to iteratively update the prompt model. We find that models trained in this manner can significantly improve performance on challenging datasets where there is currently a large gap between prompt-based learning and fully-supervised models.

**Abstract:** Recommender systems typically suggest to users content similar to what they consumed in the past. If a user happens to be exposed to strongly polarized content, she might subsequently receive recommendations which may steer her towards more and more radicalized content, eventually being trapped in what we call a "radicalization pathway". In this paper, we study the problem of mitigating radicalization pathways using a graph-based approach. Specifically, we model the set of recommendations of a "what-to-watch-next" recommender as a d-regular directed graph where nodes correspond to content items, links to recommendations, and paths to possible user sessions. We measure the "segregation" score of a node representing radicalized content as the expected length of a random walk from that node to any node representing non-radicalized content. High segregation scores are associated to larger chances to get users trapped in radicalization pathways. Hence, we define the problem of reducing the prevalence of radicalization pathways by selecting a small number of edges to "rewire", so to minimize the maximum of segregation scores among all radicalized nodes, while maintaining the relevance of the recommendations. We prove that the problem of finding the optimal set of recommendations to rewire is NP-hard and NP-hard to approximate within any factor. Therefore, we turn our attention to heuristics, and propose an efficient yet effective greedy algorithm based on the absorbing random walk theory. Our experiments on real-world datasets in the context of video and news recommendations confirm the effectiveness of our proposal.

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have recently shown great promise for generative modeling, outperforming GANs on perceptual quality and autoregressive models at density estimation. A remaining downside is their slow sampling time: generating high quality samples takes many hundreds or thousands of model evaluations. Here we make two contributions to help eliminate this downside: First, we present new parameterizations of diffusion models that provide increased stability when using few sampling steps. Second, we present a method to distill a trained deterministic diffusion sampler, using many steps, into a new diffusion model that takes half as many sampling steps. We then keep progressively applying this distillation procedure to our model, halving the number of required sampling steps each time. On standard image generation benchmarks like CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and LSUN, we start out with state-of-the-art samplers taking as many as 8192 steps, and are able to distill down to models taking as few as 4 steps without losing much perceptual quality; achieving, for example, a FID of 3.0 on CIFAR-10 in 4 steps. Finally, we show that the full progressive distillation procedure does not take more time than it takes to train the original model, thus representing an efficient solution for generative modeling using diffusion at both train and test time.

<p>

**Abstract:** Recent work suggests that representations learned by adversarially robust networks are more human perceptually-aligned than non-robust networks via image manipulations. Despite appearing closer to human visual perception, it is unclear if the constraints in robust DNN representations match biological constraints found in human vision. Human vision seems to rely on texture-based/summary statistic representations in the periphery, which have been shown to explain phenomena such as crowding and performance on visual search tasks. To understand how adversarially robust optimizations/representations compare to human vision, we performed a psychophysics experiment using a set of metameric discrimination tasks where we evaluated how well human observers could distinguish between images synthesized to match adversarially robust representations compared to non-robust representations and a texture synthesis model of peripheral vision (Texforms). We found that the discriminability of robust representation and texture model images decreased to near chance performance as stimuli were presented farther in the periphery. Moreover, performance on robust and texture-model images showed similar trends within participants, while performance on non-robust representations changed minimally across the visual field. These results together suggest that (1) adversarially robust representations capture peripheral computation better than non-robust representations and (2) robust representations capture peripheral computation similar to current state-of-the-art texture peripheral vision models. More broadly, our findings support the idea that localized texture summary statistic representations may drive human invariance to adversarial perturbations and that the incorporation of such representations in DNNs could give rise to useful properties like adversarial robustness.

**Abstract:** Despite the non-convex optimization landscape, over-parametrized shallow networks are able to achieve global convergence under gradient descent. The picture can be radically different for narrow networks, which tend to get stuck in badly-generalizing local minima. Here we investigate the cross-over between these two regimes in the high-dimensional setting, and in particular investigate the connection between the so-called mean-field/hydrodynamic regime and the seminal approach of Saad & Solla. Focusing on the case of Gaussian data, we study the interplay between the learning rate, the time scale, and the number of hidden units in the high-dimensional dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our work builds on a deterministic description of SGD in high-dimensions from statistical physics, which we extend and for which we provide rigorous convergence rates.

**Abstract:** Despite achieving incredibly low perplexities on myriad natural language corpora, today's language models still often underperform when used to generate text. This dichotomy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language as a communication channel (√† la Shannon, 1948) can provide new insights into the behaviors of probabilistic language generators, e.g., why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive. Humans use language as a means of communicating information, and do so in an efficient yet error-minimizing manner, choosing each word in a string with this (perhaps subconscious) goal in mind. We propose that generation from probabilistic models should mimic this behavior. Rather than always choosing words from the high-probability region of the distribution--which have a low Shannon information content--we sample from the set of words with an information content close to its expected value, i.e., close to the conditional entropy of our model. This decision criterion can be realized through a simple and efficient implementation, which we call typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations show that, in comparison to nucleus and top-k sampling, typical sampling offers competitive performance in terms of quality while consistently reducing the number of degenerate repetitions.

<p>

**Abstract:** We report the Regression Transformer (RT), a method that abstracts regression as a conditional sequence modeling problem. The RT casts continuous properties as sequences of numerical tokens and encodes them jointly with conventional tokens. This yields a dichotomous model that can seamlessly transition between solving regression tasks and conditional generation tasks; solely governed by the mask location. We propose several extensions to the XLNet objective and adopt an alternating training scheme to concurrently optimize property prediction and conditional text generation based on a self-consistency loss.
  Our experiments on both chemical and protein languages demonstrate that the performance of traditional regression models can be surpassed despite training with cross entropy loss. Importantly, priming the same model with continuous properties yields a highly competitive conditional generative models that outperforms specialized approaches in a constrained property optimization benchmark. In sum, the Regression Transformer opens the door for "swiss army knife" models that excel at both regression and conditional generation. This finds application particularly in property-driven, local exploration of the chemical or protein space.

**Abstract:** Natural language understanding and generation models follow one of the two dominant architectural paradigms: language models (LMs) that process concatenated sequences in a single stack of layers, and encoder-decoder models (EncDec) that utilize separate layer stacks for input and output processing. In machine translation, EncDec has long been the favoured approach, but with few studies investigating the performance of LMs. In this work, we thoroughly examine the role of several architectural design choices on the performance of LMs on bilingual, (massively) multilingual and zero-shot translation tasks, under systematic variations of data conditions and model sizes. Our results show that: (i) Different LMs have different scaling properties, where architectural differences often have a significant impact on model performance at small scales, but the performance gap narrows as the number of parameters increases, (ii) Several design choices, including causal masking and language-modeling objectives for the source sequence, have detrimental effects on translation quality, and (iii) When paired with full-visible masking for source sequences, LMs could perform on par with EncDec on supervised bilingual and multilingual translation tasks, and improve greatly on zero-shot directions by facilitating the reduction of off-target translations.

**Abstract:** While deep networks can learn complex functions such as classifiers, detectors, and trackers, many applications require models that continually adapt to changing input distributions, changing tasks, and changing environmental conditions. Indeed, this ability to continuously accrue knowledge and use past experience to learn new tasks quickly in continual settings is one of the key properties of an intelligent system. For complex and high-dimensional problems, simply updating the model continually with standard learning algorithms such as gradient descent may result in slow adaptation. Meta-learning can provide a powerful tool to accelerate adaptation yet is conventionally studied in batch settings. In this paper, we study how meta-learning can be applied to tackle online problems of this nature, simultaneously adapting to changing tasks and input distributions and meta-training the model in order to adapt more quickly in the future. Extending meta-learning into the online setting presents its own challenges, and although several prior methods have studied related problems, they generally require a discrete notion of tasks, with known ground-truth task boundaries. Such methods typically adapt to each task in sequence, resetting the model between tasks, rather than adapting continuously across tasks. In many real-world settings, such discrete boundaries are unavailable, and may not even exist. To address these settings, we propose a Fully Online Meta-Learning (FOML) algorithm, which does not require any ground truth knowledge about the task boundaries and stays fully online without resetting back to pre-trained weights. Our experiments show that FOML was able to learn new tasks faster than the state-of-the-art online learning methods on Rainbow-MNIST, CIFAR100 and CELEBA datasets.

**Abstract:** Simulation models, in particular agent-based models, are gaining popularity in economics. The considerable flexibility they offer, as well as their capacity to reproduce a variety of empirically observed behaviours of complex systems, give them broad appeal, and the increasing availability of cheap computing power has made their use feasible. Yet a widespread adoption in real-world modelling and decision-making scenarios has been hindered by the difficulty of performing parameter estimation for such models. In general, simulation models lack a tractable likelihood function, which precludes a straightforward application of standard statistical inference techniques. Several recent works have sought to address this problem through the application of likelihood-free inference techniques, in which parameter estimates are determined by performing some form of comparison between the observed data and simulation output. However, these approaches are (a) founded on restrictive assumptions, and/or (b) typically require many hundreds of thousands of simulations. These qualities make them unsuitable for large-scale simulations in economics and can cast doubt on the validity of these inference methods in such scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of two classes of black-box approximate Bayesian inference methods that have recently drawn significant attention within the probabilistic machine learning community: neural posterior estimation and neural density ratio estimation. We present benchmarking experiments in which we demonstrate that neural network based black-box methods provide state of the art parameter inference for economic simulation models, and crucially are compatible with generic multivariate time-series data. In addition, we suggest appropriate assessment criteria for future benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference procedures for economic simulation models.

**Abstract:** A large body of research in continual learning is devoted to overcoming the catastrophic forgetting of neural networks by designing new algorithms that are robust to the distribution shifts. However, the majority of these works are strictly focused on the "algorithmic" part of continual learning for a "fixed neural network architecture", and the implications of using different architectures are mostly neglected. Even the few existing continual learning methods that modify the model assume a fixed architecture and aim to develop an algorithm that efficiently uses the model throughout the learning experience. However, in this work, we show that the choice of architecture can significantly impact the continual learning performance, and different architectures lead to different trade-offs between the ability to remember previous tasks and learning new ones. Moreover, we study the impact of various architectural decisions, and our findings entail best practices and recommendations that can improve the continual learning performance.

**Abstract:** We present a conceptual framework, datamodeling, for analyzing the behavior of a model class in terms of the training data. For any fixed "target" example $x$, training set $S$, and learning algorithm, a datamodel is a parameterized function $2^S \to \mathbb{R}$ that for any subset of $S' \subset S$ -- using only information about which examples of $S$ are contained in $S'$ -- predicts the outcome of training a model on $S'$ and evaluating on $x$. Despite the potential complexity of the underlying process being approximated (e.g., end-to-end training and evaluation of deep neural networks), we show that even simple linear datamodels can successfully predict model outputs. We then demonstrate that datamodels give rise to a variety of applications, such as: accurately predicting the effect of dataset counterfactuals; identifying brittle predictions; finding semantically similar examples; quantifying train-test leakage; and embedding data into a well-behaved and feature-rich representation space. Data for this paper (including pre-computed datamodels as well as raw predictions from four million trained deep neural networks) is available at https://github.com/MadryLab/datamodels-data .

**Abstract:** Learning causal relationships in high-dimensional data (images, videos) is a hard task, as they are often defined on low dimensional manifolds and must be extracted from complex signals dominated by appearance, lighting, textures and also spurious correlations in the data. We present a method for learning counterfactual reasoning of physical processes in pixel space, which requires the prediction of the impact of interventions on initial conditions. Going beyond the identification of structural relationships, we deal with the challenging problem of forecasting raw video over long horizons. Our method does not require the knowledge or supervision of any ground truth positions or other object or scene properties. Our model learns and acts on a suitable hybrid latent representation based on a combination of dense features, sets of 2D keypoints and an additional latent vector per keypoint. We show that this better captures the dynamics of physical processes than purely dense or sparse representations. We introduce a new challenging and carefully designed counterfactual benchmark for predictions in pixel space and outperform strong baselines in physics-inspired ML and video prediction.

**Abstract:** There is currently a debate within the neuroscience community over the likelihood of the brain performing backpropagation (BP). To better mimic the brain, training a network \textit{one layer at a time} with only a "single forward pass" has been proposed as an alternative to bypass BP; we refer to these networks as "layer-wise" networks. We continue the work on layer-wise networks by answering two outstanding questions. First, $\textit{do they have a closed-form solution?}$ Second, $\textit{how do we know when to stop adding more layers?}$ This work proves that the Kernel Mean Embedding is the closed-form weight that achieves the network global optimum while driving these networks to converge towards a highly desirable kernel for classification; we call it the $\textit{Neural Indicator Kernel}$.

**Abstract:** Driver behavior profiling is one of the main issues in the insurance industries and fleet management, thus being able to classify the driver behavior with low-cost mobile applications remains in the spotlight of autonomous driving. However, using mobile sensors may face the challenge of security, privacy, and trust issues. To overcome those challenges, we propose to collect data sensors using Carla Simulator available in smartphones (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, GPS) in order to classify the driver behavior using speed, acceleration, direction, the 3-axis rotation angles (Yaw, Pitch, Roll) taking into account the speed limit of the current road and weather conditions to better identify the risky behavior. Secondly, after fusing inter-axial data from multiple sensors into a single file, we explore different machine learning algorithms for time series classification to evaluate which algorithm results in the highest performance.

**Abstract:** Mining the latent intentions from large volumes of natural language inputs is a key step to help data analysts design and refine Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) for customer service and sales support. We created a flexible and scalable clustering pipeline within the Verint Intent Manager (VIM) that integrates the fine-tuning of language models, a high performing k-NN library and community detection techniques to help analysts quickly surface and organize relevant user intentions from conversational texts. The fine-tuning step is necessary because pre-trained language models cannot encode texts to efficiently surface particular clustering structures when the target texts are from an unseen domain or the clustering task is not topic detection. We describe the pipeline and demonstrate its performance using BERT on three real-world text mining tasks. As deployed in the VIM application, this clustering pipeline produces high quality results, improving the performance of data analysts and reducing the time it takes to surface intentions from customer service data, thereby reducing the time it takes to build and deploy IVAs in new domains.

**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have proven effective in modeling sequential user feedbacks for recommender systems. However, they usually focus solely on item relevance and fail to effectively explore diverse items for users, therefore harming the system performance in the long run. To address this problem, we propose a new type of recurrent neural networks, dubbed recurrent exploration networks (REN), to jointly perform representation learning and effective exploration in the latent space. REN tries to balance relevance and exploration while taking into account the uncertainty in the representations. Our theoretical analysis shows that REN can preserve the rate-optimal sublinear regret even when there exists uncertainty in the learned representations. Our empirical study demonstrates that REN can achieve satisfactory long-term rewards on both synthetic and real-world recommendation datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

**Abstract:** Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy(American Cancer Society) which is primarily diagnosed visually, starting with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic(related to skin) analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Skin cancer occurs when errors (mutations) occur in the DNA of skin cells. The mutations cause the cells to grow out of control and form a mass of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to try to classify images of skin lesions with the help of convolutional neural networks. The deep neural networks show humongous potential for image classification while taking into account the large variability exhibited by the environment. Here we trained images based on the pixel values and classified them on the basis of disease labels. The dataset was acquired from an Open Source Kaggle Repository(Kaggle Dataset)which itself was acquired from ISIC(International Skin Imaging Collaboration) Archive. The training was performed on multiple models accompanied with Transfer Learning. The highest model accuracy achieved was over 86.65%. The dataset used is publicly available to ensure credibility and reproducibility of the aforementioned result.

**Abstract:** Optimization is a ubiquitous modeling tool that is often deployed in settings that repeatedly solve similar instances of the same problem. Amortized optimization methods use learning to predict the solutions to problems in these settings. This leverages the shared structure between similar problem instances. In this tutorial, we will discuss the key design choices behind amortized optimization, roughly categorizing 1) models into fully-amortized and semi-amortized approaches, and 2) learning methods into regression-based and objective-based. We then view existing applications through these foundations to draw connections between them, including for manifold optimization, variational inference, sparse coding, meta-learning, control, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, and deep equilibrium networks. This framing enables us easily see, for example, that the amortized inference in variational autoencoders is conceptually identical to value gradients in control and reinforcement learning as they both use fully-amortized models with a objective-based loss.

**Abstract:** Keypoint detection and description play a central role in computer vision. Most existing methods are in the form of scene-level prediction, without returning the object classes of different keypoints. In this paper, we propose the object-centric formulation, which, beyond the conventional setting, requires further identifying which object each interest point belongs to. With such fine-grained information, our framework enables more downstream potentials, such as object-level matching and pose estimation in a clustered environment. To get around the difficulty of label collection in the real world, we develop a sim2real contrastive learning mechanism that can generalize the model trained in simulation to real-world applications. The novelties of our training method are three-fold: (i) we integrate the uncertainty into the learning framework to improve feature description of hard cases, e.g., less-textured or symmetric patches; (ii) we decouple the object descriptor into two output branches -- intra-object salience and inter-object distinctness, resulting in a better pixel-wise description; (iii) we enforce cross-view semantic consistency for enhanced robustness in representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on image matching and 6D pose estimation verify the encouraging generalization ability of our method from simulation to reality. Particularly for 6D pose estimation, our method significantly outperforms typical unsupervised/sim2real methods, achieving a closer gap with the fully supervised counterpart.

**Abstract:** Signal-background classification is a central problem in High-Energy Physics, that plays a major role for the discovery of new fundamental particles. A recent method -- the Parametric Neural Network (pNN) -- leverages multiple signal mass hypotheses as an additional input feature to effectively replace a whole set of individual classifier, each providing (in principle) the best response for a single mass hypothesis. In this work we aim at deepening the understanding of pNNs in light of real-world usage. We discovered several peculiarities of parametric networks, providing intuition, metrics, and guidelines to them. We further propose an alternative parametrization scheme, resulting in a new parametrized neural network architecture: the AffinePNN; along with many other generally applicable improvements. Finally, we extensively evaluate our models on the HEPMASS dataset, along its imbalanced version (called HEPMASS-IMB) we provide here for the first time to further validate our approach. Provided results are in terms of the impact of the proposed design decisions, classification performance, and interpolation capability as well.

**Abstract:** FO(.) (aka FO-dot) is a language that extends classical first-order logic with constructs to allow complex knowledge to be represented in a natural and elaboration-tolerant way.
  IDP-Z3 is a new reasoning engine for the FO(.) language: it can perform a variety of generic computational tasks using knowledge represented in FO(.). It supersedes IDP3, its predecessor, with new capabilities such as support for linear arithmetic over reals and quantification over concepts.
  We present four knowledge-intensive industrial use cases, and show that IDP-Z3 delivers real value to its users at low development costs: it supports interactive applications in a variety of problem domains, with a response time typically below 3 seconds.

**Abstract:** We explore active audio-visual separation for dynamic sound sources, where an embodied agent moves intelligently in a 3D environment to continuously isolate the time-varying audio stream being emitted by an object of interest. The agent hears a mixed stream of multiple time-varying audio sources (e.g., multiple people conversing and a band playing music at a noisy party). Given a limited time budget, it needs to extract the target sound using egocentric audio-visual observations. We propose a reinforcement learning agent equipped with a novel transformer memory that learns motion policies to control its camera and microphone to recover the dynamic target audio, improving its own estimates for past timesteps via self-attention. Using highly realistic acoustic SoundSpaces simulations in real-world scanned Matterport3D environments, we show that our model is able to learn efficient behavior to carry out continuous separation of a time-varying audio target.

**Abstract:** Data-driven approaches to modeling physical systems fail to generalize to unseen systems that share the same general dynamics with the learning domain, but correspond to different physical contexts. We propose a new framework for this key problem, context-informed dynamics adaptation (CoDA), which takes into account the distributional shift across systems for fast and efficient adaptation to new dynamics. CoDA leverages multiple environments, each associated to a different dynamic, and learns to condition the dynamics model on contextual parameters, specific to each environment. The conditioning is performed via a hypernetwork, learned jointly with a context vector from observed data. The proposed formulation constrains the search hypothesis space to foster fast adaptation and better generalization across environments. It extends the expressivity of existing methods. We theoretically motivate our approach and show state-ofthe-art generalization results on a set of nonlinear dynamics, representative of a variety of application domains. We also show, on these systems, that new system parameters can be inferred from context vectors with minimal supervision.

**Abstract:** We study algorithms for learning low-rank neural networks -- networks where the weight parameters are re-parameterized by products of two low-rank matrices. First, we present a provably efficient algorithm which learns an optimal low-rank approximation to a single-hidden-layer ReLU network up to additive error $Œµ$ with probability $\ge 1 - Œ¥$, given access to noiseless samples with Gaussian marginals in polynomial time and samples. Thus, we provide the first example of an algorithm which can efficiently learn a neural network up to additive error without assuming the ground truth is realizable. To solve this problem, we introduce an efficient SVD-based $\textit{Nonlinear Kernel Projection}$ algorithm for solving a nonlinear low-rank approximation problem over Gaussian space. Inspired by the efficiency of our algorithm, we propose a novel low-rank initialization framework for training low-rank $\textit{deep}$ networks, and prove that for ReLU networks, the gap between our method and existing schemes widens as the desired rank of the approximating weights decreases, or as the dimension of the inputs increases (the latter point holds when network width is superlinear in dimension). Finally, we validate our theory by training ResNet and EfficientNet models on ImageNet.

**Abstract:** Machine learning has the potential to automate molecular design and drastically accelerate the discovery of new functional compounds. Towards this goal, generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) using string and graph representations have been successfully used to search for novel molecules. However, these approaches are limited since their representations ignore the three-dimensional (3D) structure of molecules. In fact, geometry plays an important role in many applications in inverse molecular design, especially in drug discovery. Thus, it is important to build models that can generate molecular structures in 3D space based on property-oriented geometric constraints. To address this, one approach is to generate molecules as 3D point clouds by sequentially placing atoms at locations in space -- this allows the process to be guided by physical quantities such as energy or other properties. However, this approach is inefficient as placing individual atoms makes the exploration unnecessarily deep, limiting the complexity of molecules that can be generated. Moreover, when optimizing a molecule, organic and medicinal chemists use known fragments and functional groups, not single atoms. We introduce a novel RL framework for scalable 3D design that uses a hierarchical agent to build molecules by placing molecular substructures sequentially in 3D space, thus attempting to build on the existing human knowledge in the field of molecular design. In a variety of experiments with different substructures, we show that our agent, guided only by energy considerations, can efficiently learn to produce molecules with over 100 atoms from many distributions including drug-like molecules, organic LED molecules, and biomolecules.

**Abstract:** Representing words by vectors, or embeddings, enables computational reasoning and is foundational to automating natural language tasks. For example, if word embeddings of similar words contain similar values, word similarity can be readily assessed, whereas judging that from their spelling is often impossible (e.g. cat /feline) and to predetermine and store similarities between all words is prohibitively time-consuming, memory intensive and subjective. We focus on word embeddings learned from text corpora and knowledge graphs. Several well-known algorithms learn word embeddings from text on an unsupervised basis by learning to predict those words that occur around each word, e.g. word2vec and GloVe. Parameters of such word embeddings are known to reflect word co-occurrence statistics, but how they capture semantic meaning has been unclear. Knowledge graph representation models learn representations both of entities (words, people, places, etc.) and relations between them, typically by training a model to predict known facts in a supervised manner. Despite steady improvements in fact prediction accuracy, little is understood of the latent structure that enables this.
  The limited understanding of how latent semantic structure is encoded in the geometry of word embeddings and knowledge graph representations makes a principled means of improving their performance, reliability or interpretability unclear. To address this:
  1. we theoretically justify the empirical observation that particular geometric relationships between word embeddings learned by algorithms such as word2vec and GloVe correspond to semantic relations between words; and
  2. we extend this correspondence between semantics and geometry to the entities and relations of knowledge graphs, providing a model for the latent structure of knowledge graph representation linked to that of word embeddings.

**Abstract:** Studies of active learning traditionally assume the target and source data stem from a single domain. However, in realistic applications, practitioners often require active learning with multiple sources of out-of-distribution data, where it is unclear a priori which data sources will help or hurt the target domain. We survey a wide variety of techniques in active learning (AL), domain shift detection (DS), and multi-domain sampling to examine this challenging setting for question answering and sentiment analysis. We ask (1) what family of methods are effective for this task? And, (2) what properties of selected examples and domains achieve strong results? Among 18 acquisition functions from 4 families of methods, we find H-Divergence methods, and particularly our proposed variant DAL-E, yield effective results, averaging 2-3% improvements over the random baseline. We also show the importance of a diverse allocation of domains, as well as room-for-improvement of existing methods on both domain and example selection. Our findings yield the first comprehensive analysis of both existing and novel methods for practitioners faced with multi-domain active learning for natural language tasks.

**Abstract:** Ultrasound b-mode imaging is a qualitative approach and diagnostic quality strongly depends on operators' training and experience. Quantitative approaches can provide information about tissue properties; therefore, can be used for identifying various tissue types, e.g., speed-of-sound in the tissue can be used as a biomarker for tissue malignancy, especially in breast imaging. Recent studies showed the possibility of speed-of-sound reconstruction using deep neural networks that are fully trained on simulated data. However, because of the ever present domain shift between simulated and measured data, the stability and performance of these models in real setups are still under debate. In this study, we investigated the impacts of training data diversity on the robustness of these networks by using multiple kinds of geometrical and natural simulated phantom structures. On the simulated data, we investigated the performance of the networks on out-of-domain echogenicity, geometries, and in the presence of noise. We further inspected the stability of employing such tissue modeling in a real data acquisition setup. We demonstrated that training the network with a joint set of datasets including both geometrical and natural tissue models improves the stability of the predicted speed-of-sound values both on simulated and measured data.

**Abstract:** Audio classification is an important task of mapping audio samples into their corresponding labels. Recently, the transformer model with self-attention mechanisms has been adopted in this field. However, existing audio transformers require large GPU memories and long training time, meanwhile relying on pretrained vision models to achieve high performance, which limits the model's scalability in audio tasks. To combat these problems, we introduce HTS-AT: an audio transformer with a hierarchical structure to reduce the model size and training time. It is further combined with a token-semantic module to map final outputs into class featuremaps, thus enabling the model for the audio event detection (i.e. localization in time). We evaluate HTS-AT on three datasets of audio classification where it achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on AudioSet and ESC-50, and equals the SOTA on Speech Command V2. It also achieves better performance in event localization than the previous CNN-based models. Moreover, HTS-AT requires only 35% model parameters and 15% training time of the previous audio transformer. These results demonstrate the high performance and high efficiency of HTS-AT.

**Abstract:** We investigate properties of goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD). We introduce a strategy to construct a test, called KSDAgg, which aggregates multiple tests with different kernels. KSDAgg avoids splitting the data to perform kernel selection (which leads to a loss in test power), and rather maximises the test power over a collection of kernels. We provide theoretical guarantees on the power of KSDAgg: we show it achieves the smallest uniform separation rate of the collection, up to a logarithmic term. KSDAgg can be computed exactly in practice as it relies either on a parametric bootstrap or on a wild bootstrap to estimate the quantiles and the level corrections. In particular, for the crucial choice of bandwidth of a fixed kernel, it avoids resorting to arbitrary heuristics (such as median or standard deviation) or to data splitting. We find on both synthetic and real-world data that KSDAgg outperforms other state-of-the-art adaptive KSD-based goodness-of-fit testing procedures.

**Abstract:** Planetary rover systems need to perform terrain segmentation to identify drivable areas as well as identify specific types of soil for sample collection. The latest Martian terrain segmentation methods rely on supervised learning which is very data hungry and difficult to train where only a small number of labeled samples are available. Moreover, the semantic classes are defined differently for different applications (e.g., rover traversal vs. geological) and as a result the network has to be trained from scratch each time, which is an inefficient use of resources. This research proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for Mars terrain segmentation where a deep segmentation network trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images is transferred to the task of terrain segmentation trained on few labeled images. The network incorporates a backbone module which is trained using a contrastive loss function and an output atrous convolution module which is trained using a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss function. Evaluation results using the metric of segmentation accuracy show that the proposed method with contrastive pretraining outperforms plain supervised learning by 2%-10%. Moreover, the proposed model is able to achieve a segmentation accuracy of 91.1% using only 161 training images (1% of the original dataset) compared to 81.9% with plain supervised learning.

**Abstract:** Distributional reinforcement learning~(RL) is a class of state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the whole distribution of the total return rather than only its expectation. The representation manner of each return distribution and the choice of distribution divergence are pivotal for the empirical success of distributional RL. In this paper, we propose a new class of \textit{Sinkhorn distributional RL} algorithm that learns a finite set of statistics, i.e., deterministic samples, from each return distribution and then leverages Sinkhorn iterations to evaluate the Sinkhorn distance between the current and target Bellmen distributions. Remarkably, as Sinkhorn divergence interpolates between the Wasserstein distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy~(MMD). This allows our proposed Sinkhorn distributional RL algorithms to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of optimal transport-based distance, and the unbiased gradient estimates of MMD. Finally, experiments on a suite of Atari games reveal the competitive performance of Sinkhorn distributional RL algorithm as opposed to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in computer vision have seen a rise in the prominence of applications using neural networks to understand human poses. However, while accuracy has been steadily increasing on State-of-the-Art datasets, these datasets often do not address the challenges seen in real-world applications. These challenges are dealing with people distant from the camera, people in crowds, and heavily occluded people. As a result, many real-world applications have trained on data that does not reflect the data present in deployment, leading to significant underperformance. This article presents ADG-Pose, a method for automatically generating datasets for real-world human pose estimation. These datasets can be customized to determine person distances, crowdedness, and occlusion distributions. Models trained with our method are able to perform in the presence of these challenges where those trained on other datasets fail. Using ADG-Pose, end-to-end accuracy for real-world skeleton-based action recognition sees a 20% increase on scenes with moderate distance and occlusion levels, and a 4X increase on distant scenes where other models failed to perform better than random.

**Abstract:** Accurate object rearrangement from vision is a crucial problem for a wide variety of real-world robotics applications in unstructured environments. We propose IFOR, Iterative Flow Minimization for Robotic Object Rearrangement, an end-to-end method for the challenging problem of object rearrangement for unknown objects given an RGBD image of the original and final scenes. First, we learn an optical flow model based on RAFT to estimate the relative transformation of the objects purely from synthetic data. This flow is then used in an iterative minimization algorithm to achieve accurate positioning of previously unseen objects. Crucially, we show that our method applies to cluttered scenes, and in the real world, while training only on synthetic data. Videos are available at https://imankgoyal.github.io/ifor.html.

**Abstract:** Dense geometric matching is a challenging computer vision task, requiring accurate correspondences under extreme variations in viewpoint and illumination, even for low-texture regions. In this task, finding accurate global correspondences is essential for later refinement stages. The current learning based paradigm is to perform global fixed-size correlation, followed by flattening and convolution to predict correspondences. In this work, we consider the problem from a different perspective and propose to formulate global correspondence estimation as a continuous probabilistic regression task using deep kernels, yielding a novel approach to learning dense correspondences. Our full approach, \textbf{D}eep \textbf{K}ernelized \textbf{M}atching, achieves significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art on the competitive HPatches and YFCC100m benchmarks, and we dissect the gains of our contributions in a thorough ablation study.

**Abstract:** Message passing neural networks (MPNN) have seen a steep rise in popularity since their introduction as generalizations of convolutional neural networks to graph structured data, and are now considered state-of-the-art tools for solving a large variety of graph-focused problems. We study the generalization capabilities of MPNNs in graph classification. We assume that graphs of different classes are sampled from different random graph models. Based on this data distribution, we derive a non-asymptotic bound on the generalization gap between the empirical and statistical loss, that decreases to zero as the graphs become larger. This is proven by showing that a MPNN, applied on a graph, approximates the MPNN applied on the geometric model that the graph discretizes.

**Abstract:** In performative prediction, the deployment of a predictive model triggers a shift in the data distribution. As these shifts are typically unknown ahead of time, the learner needs to deploy a model to get feedback about the distribution it induces. We study the problem of finding near-optimal models under performativity while maintaining low regret. On the surface, this problem might seem equivalent to a bandit problem. However, it exhibits a fundamentally richer feedback structure that we refer to as performative feedback: after every deployment, the learner receives samples from the shifted distribution rather than only bandit feedback about the reward. Our main contribution is regret bounds that scale only with the complexity of the distribution shifts and not that of the reward function. The key algorithmic idea is careful exploration of the distribution shifts that informs a novel construction of confidence bounds on the risk of unexplored models. The construction only relies on smoothness of the shifts and does not assume convexity. More broadly, our work establishes a conceptual approach for leveraging tools from the bandits literature for the purpose of regret minimization with performative feedback.

By conducting extensive experiments on four datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for retaining the semantic content of the original text while inducing lexical novelty in the generation.

**Abstract:** Deep learning approaches are successful in a wide range of AI problems and in particular for visual recognition tasks. However, there are still open problems among which is the capacity to handle streams of visual information and the management of class imbalance in datasets. Existing research approaches these two problems separately while they co-occur in real world applications. Here, we study the problem of learning incrementally from imbalanced datasets. We focus on algorithms which have a constant deep model complexity and use a bounded memory to store exemplars of old classes across incremental states. Since memory is bounded, old classes are learned with fewer images than new classes and an imbalance due to incremental learning is added to the initial dataset imbalance. A score prediction bias in favor of new classes appears and we evaluate a comprehensive set of score calibration methods to reduce it. Evaluation is carried with three datasets, using two dataset imbalance configurations and three bounded memory sizes. Results show that most calibration methods have beneficial effect and that they are most useful for lower bounded memory sizes, which are most interesting in practice. As a secondary contribution, we remove the usual distillation component from the loss function of incremental learning algorithms. We show that simpler vanilla fine tuning is a stronger backbone for imbalanced incremental learning algorithms.

**Abstract:** Local detection of magnetic fields is crucial for characterizing nano- and micro-materials and has been implemented using various scanning techniques or even diamond quantum sensors. Diamond nanoparticles (nanodiamonds) offer an attractive opportunity to chieve high spatial resolution because they can easily be close to the target within a few 10 nm simply by attaching them to its surface. A physical model for such a randomly oriented nanodiamond ensemble (NDE) is available, but the complexity of actual experimental conditions still limits the accuracy of deducing magnetic fields. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field imaging with high accuracy of 1.8 $Œº$T combining NDE and machine learning without any physical models. We also discover the field direction dependence of the NDE signal, suggesting the potential application for vector magnetometry and improvement of the existing model. Our method further enriches the performance of NDE to achieve the accuracy to visualize mesoscopic current and magnetism in atomic-layer materials and to expand the applicability in arbitrarily shaped materials, including living organisms. This achievement will bridge machine learning and quantum sensing for accurate measurements.

**Abstract:** Learning is a distinctive feature of intelligent behaviour. High-throughput experimental data and Big Data promise to open new windows on complex systems such as cells, the brain or our societies. Yet, the puzzling success of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning shows that we still have a poor conceptual understanding of learning. These applications push statistical inference into uncharted territories where data is high-dimensional and scarce, and prior information on "true" models is scant if not totally absent. Here we review recent progress on understanding learning, based on the notion of "relevance". The relevance, as we define it here, quantifies the amount of information that a dataset or the internal representation of a learning machine contains on the generative model of the data. This allows us to define maximally informative samples, on one hand, and optimal learning machines on the other. These are ideal limits of samples and of machines, that contain the maximal amount of information about the unknown generative process, at a given resolution (or level of compression). Both ideal limits exhibit critical features in the statistical sense: Maximally informative samples are characterised by a power-law frequency distribution (statistical criticality) and optimal learning machines by an anomalously large susceptibility. The trade-off between resolution (i.e. compression) and relevance distinguishes the regime of noisy representations from that of lossy compression. These are separated by a special point characterised by Zipf's law statistics. This identifies samples obeying Zipf's law as the most compressed loss-less representations that are optimal in the sense of maximal relevance. Criticality in optimal learning machines manifests in an exponential degeneracy of energy levels, that leads to unusual thermodynamic properties.

**Abstract:** Building subject-independent deep learning models for EEG decoding faces the challenge of strong covariate-shift across different datasets, subjects and recording sessions. Our approach to address this difficulty is to explicitly align feature distributions at various layers of the deep learning model, using both simple statistical techniques as well as trainable methods with more representational capacity. This follows in a similar vein as covariance-based alignment methods, often used in a Riemannian manifold context. The methodology proposed herein won first place in the 2021 Benchmarks in EEG Transfer Learning (BEETL) competition, hosted at the NeurIPS conference. The first task of the competition consisted of sleep stage classification, which required the transfer of models trained on younger subjects to perform inference on multiple subjects of older age groups without personalized calibration data, requiring subject-independent models. The second task required to transfer models trained on the subjects of one or more source motor imagery datasets to perform inference on two target datasets, providing a small set of personalized calibration data for multiple test subjects.

**Abstract:** The development of self-propelled particles at the micro- and the nanoscale has sparked a huge potential for future applications in active matter physics, microsurgery, and targeted drug delivery. However, while the latter applications provoke the quest on how to optimally navigate towards a target, such as e.g. a cancer cell, there is still no simple way known to determine the optimal route in sufficiently complex environments. Here we develop a machine learning-based approach that allows us, for the first time, to determine the asymptotically optimal path of a self-propelled agent which can freely steer in complex environments. Our method hinges on policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning techniques and, crucially, does not require any reward shaping or heuristics. The presented method provides a powerful alternative to current analytical methods to calculate optimal trajectories and opens a route towards a universal path planner for future intelligent active particles.

**Abstract:** A major bottleneck in training robust Human-Activity Recognition models (HAR) is the need for large-scale labeled sensor datasets. Because labeling large amounts of sensor data is an expensive task, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques have emerged that can learn good features from the data without requiring any labels. In this paper, we extend this line of research and present a novel technique called Collaborative Self-Supervised Learning (ColloSSL) which leverages unlabeled data collected from multiple devices worn by a user to learn high-quality features of the data. A key insight that underpins the design of ColloSSL is that unlabeled sensor datasets simultaneously captured by multiple devices can be viewed as natural transformations of each other, and leveraged to generate a supervisory signal for representation learning. We present three technical innovations to extend conventional self-supervised learning algorithms to a multi-device setting: a Device Selection approach which selects positive and negative devices to enable contrastive learning, a Contrastive Sampling algorithm which samples positive and negative examples in a multi-device setting, and a loss function called Multi-view Contrastive Loss which extends standard contrastive loss to a multi-device setting. Our experimental results on three multi-device datasets show that ColloSSL outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques in majority of the experiment settings, resulting in an absolute increase of upto 7.9% in F_1 score compared to the best performing baselines. We also show that ColloSSL outperforms the fully-supervised methods in a low-data regime, by just using one-tenth of the available labeled data in the best case.

**Abstract:** The scarcity of pixel-level annotation is a prevalent problem in medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization strategy involving interpolation-based mixing for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The proposed method is a new consistency regularization strategy that encourages segmentation of interpolation of two unlabelled data to be consistent with the interpolation of segmentation maps of those data. This method represents a specific type of data-adaptive regularization paradigm which aids to minimize the overfitting of labelled data under high confidence values. The proposed method is advantageous over adversarial and generative models as it requires no additional computation. Upon evaluation on two publicly available MRI datasets: ACDC and MMWHS, experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to existing semi-supervised models.

**Abstract:** Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is improving ever more at mimicking human speech processing. The functioning of ASR, however, remains to a large extent obfuscated by the complex structure of the deep neural networks (DNNs) they are based on. In this paper, we show how so-called attribution methods, that we import from image recognition and suitably adapt to handle audio data, can help to clarify the working of ASR. Taking DeepSpeech, an end-to-end model for ASR, as a case study, we show how these techniques help to visualize which features of the input are the most influential in determining the output. We focus on three visualization techniques: Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Saliency Maps, and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). We compare these methods and discuss potential further applications, such as in the detection of adversarial examples.

**Abstract:** For training neural networks, flat-minima optimizers that seek to find parameters in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss (flat minima) have been shown to improve upon stochastic and adaptive gradient-based methods. Two methods for finding flat minima stand out: 1. Averaging methods (i.e., Stochastic Weight Averaging, SWA), and 2. Minimax methods (i.e., Sharpness Aware Minimization, SAM). However, despite similar motivations, there has been limited investigation into their properties and no comprehensive comparison between them. In this work, we investigate the loss surfaces from a systematic benchmarking of these approaches across computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning tasks. The results lead to a simple hypothesis: since both approaches find different flat solutions, combining them should improve generalization even further. We verify this improves over either flat-minima approach in 39 out of 42 cases. When it does not, we investigate potential reasons. We hope our results across image, graph, and text data will help researchers to improve deep learning optimizers, and practitioners to pinpoint the optimizer for the problem at hand.

**Abstract:** Obtaining reliable, adaptive confidence sets for prediction functions (hypotheses) is a central challenge in sequential decision-making tasks, such as bandits and model-based reinforcement learning. These confidence sets typically rely on prior assumptions on the hypothesis space, e.g., the known kernel of a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Hand-designing such kernels is error prone, and misspecification may lead to poor or unsafe performance. In this work, we propose to meta-learn a kernel from offline data (Meta-KeL). For the case where the unknown kernel is a combination of known base kernels, we develop an estimator based on structured sparsity. Under mild conditions, we guarantee that our estimated RKHS yields valid confidence sets that, with increasing amounts of offline data, become as tight as those given the true unknown kernel. We demonstrate our approach on the kernelized bandit problem (a.k.a.~Bayesian optimization), where we establish regret bounds competitive with those given the true kernel. We also empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a Bayesian optimization task.

**Abstract:** Hungarian is spoken by 15 million people, still, easily accessible Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) benchmark datasets - especially for spontaneous speech - have been practically unavailable. In this paper, we introduce BEA-Base, a subset of the BEA spoken Hungarian database comprising mostly spontaneous speech of 140 speakers. It is built specifically to assess ASR, primarily for conversational AI applications. After defining the speech recognition subsets and task, several baselines - including classic HMM-DNN hybrid and end-to-end approaches augmented by cross-language transfer learning - are developed using open-source toolkits. The best results obtained are based on multilingual self-supervised pretraining, achieving a 45% recognition error rate reduction as compared to the classical approach - without the application of an external language model or additional supervised data. The results show the feasibility of using BEA-Base for training and evaluation of Hungarian speech recognition systems.

**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) has rapidly risen in popularity due to its promise of privacy and efficiency. Previous works have exposed privacy vulnerabilities in the FL pipeline by recovering user data from gradient updates. However, existing attacks fail to address realistic settings because they either 1) require a `toy' settings with very small batch sizes, or 2) require unrealistic and conspicuous architecture modifications. We introduce a new strategy that dramatically elevates existing attacks to operate on batches of arbitrarily large size, and without architectural modifications. Our model-agnostic strategy only requires modifications to the model parameters sent to the user, which is a realistic threat model in many scenarios. We demonstrate the strategy in challenging large-scale settings, obtaining high-fidelity data extraction in both cross-device and cross-silo federated learning.

**Abstract:** The domain generalization (DG) problem setting challenges a model trained on multiple known data distributions to generalise well on unseen data distributions. Due to its practical importance, a large number of methods have been proposed to address this challenge. However much of the work in general purpose DG is heuristically motivated, as the DG problem is hard to model formally; and recent evaluations have cast doubt on existing methods' practical efficacy -- in particular compared to a well tuned empirical risk minimisation baseline. We present a novel learning-theoretic generalisation bound for DG that bounds unseen domain generalisation performance in terms of the model's Rademacher complexity. Based on this, we conjecture that existing methods' efficacy or lack thereof is largely determined by an empirical risk vs predictor complexity trade-off, and demonstrate that their performance variability can be explained in these terms. Algorithmically, this analysis suggests that domain generalisation should be achieved by simply performing regularised ERM with a leave-one-domain-out cross-validation objective. Empirical results on the DomainBed benchmark corroborate this.

<p>

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the impact of head movements on audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE). Although being a common conversational feature, head movements have been ignored by past and recent studies: they challenge today's learning-based methods as they often degrade the performance of models that are trained on clean, frontal, and steady face images. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use robust face frontalization (RFF) in combination with an AVSE method based on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model. We briefly describe the basic ingredients of the proposed pipeline and we perform experiments with a recently released audio-visual dataset. In the light of these experiments, and based on three standard metrics, namely STOI, PESQ and SI-SDR, we conclude that RFF improves the performance of AVSE by a considerable margin.

**Abstract:** Memory footprint is one of the main limiting factors for large neural network training. In backpropagation, one needs to store the input to each operation in the computational graph. Every modern neural network model has quite a few pointwise nonlinearities in its architecture, and such operation induces additional memory costs which -- as we show -- can be significantly reduced by quantization of the gradients. We propose a systematic approach to compute optimal quantization of the retained gradients of the pointwise nonlinear functions with only a few bits per each element. We show that such approximation can be achieved by computing optimal piecewise-constant approximation of the derivative of the activation function, which can be done by dynamic programming. The drop-in replacements are implemented for all popular nonlinearities and can be used in any existing pipeline. We confirm the memory reduction and the same convergence on several open benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Message passing is a fundamental procedure for graph neural networks in the field of graph representation learning. Based on the homophily assumption, the current message passing always aggregates features of connected nodes, such as the graph Laplacian smoothing process. However, real-world graphs tend to be noisy and/or non-smooth. The homophily assumption does not always hold, leading to sub-optimal results. A revised message passing method needs to maintain each node's discriminative ability when aggregating the message from neighbors. To this end, we propose a Memory-based Message Passing (MMP) method to decouple the message of each node into a self-embedding part for discrimination and a memory part for propagation. Furthermore, we develop a control mechanism and a decoupling regularization to control the ratio of absorbing and excluding the message in the memory for each node. More importantly, our MMP is a general skill that can work as an additional layer to help improve traditional GNNs performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets with different homophily ratios demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** Compensating scarce measurements by inferring them from computational models is a way to address ill-posed inverse problems. We tackle Limited Angle Tomography by completing the set of acquisitions using a generative model and prior-knowledge about the scanned object. Using a Generative Adversarial Network as model and Computer-Assisted Design data as shape prior, we demonstrate a quantitative and qualitative advantage of our technique over other state-of-the-art methods. Inferring a substantial number of consecutive missing measurements, we offer an alternative to other image inpainting techniques that fall short of providing a satisfying answer to our research question: can X-Ray exposition be reduced by using generative models to infer lacking measurements?

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach for various applications, ranging from social network analysis to modeling chemical properties of molecules. While GNNs often show remarkable performance on public datasets, they can struggle to learn long-range dependencies in the data due to over-smoothing and over-squashing tendencies. To alleviate this challenge, we propose PCAPass, a method which combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and message passing for generating node embeddings in an unsupervised manner and leverages gradient boosted decision trees for classification tasks. We show empirically that this approach provides competitive performance compared to popular GNNs on node classification benchmarks, while gathering information from longer distance neighborhoods. Our research demonstrates that applying dimensionality reduction with message passing and skip connections is a promising mechanism for aggregating long-range dependencies in graph structured data.

**Abstract:** Social media has become extremely influential when it comes to policy making in modern societies especially in the western world (e.g., 48% of Europeans use social media every day or almost every day). Platforms such as Twitter allow users to follow politicians, thus making citizens more involved in political discussion. In the same vein, politicians use Twitter to express their opinions, debate among others on current topics and promote their political agenda aiming to influence voter behaviour. Previous studies have shown that tweets conveying negative sentiment are likely to be retweeted more frequently. In this paper, we attempt to analyse tweets from politicians from different countries and explore if their tweets follow the same trend. Utilising state-of-the-art pre-trained language models we performed sentiment analysis on multilingual tweets collected from members of parliament of Greece, Spain and United Kingdom, including devolved administrations. We achieved this by systematically exploring and analysing the differences between influential and less popular tweets. Our analysis indicates that politicians' negatively charged tweets spread more widely, especially in more recent times, and highlights interesting trends in the intersection of sentiment and popularity.

**Abstract:** Active learning aims to optimize the dataset annotation process when resources are constrained. Most existing methods are designed for balanced datasets. Their practical applicability is limited by the fact that a majority of real-life datasets are actually imbalanced. Here, we introduce a new active learning method which is designed for imbalanced datasets. It favors samples likely to be in minority classes so as to reduce the imbalance of the labeled subset and create a better representation for these classes. We also compare two training schemes for active learning: (1) the one commonly deployed in deep active learning using model fine tuning for each iteration and (2) a scheme which is inspired by transfer learning and exploits generic pre-trained models and train shallow classifiers for each iteration. Evaluation is run with three imbalanced datasets. Results show that the proposed active learning method outperforms competitive baselines. Equally interesting, they also indicate that the transfer learning training scheme outperforms model fine tuning if features are transferable from the generic dataset to the unlabeled one. This last result is surprising and should encourage the community to explore the design of deep active learning methods.

**Abstract:** Recent years have seen a significant amount of interests in Sequential Recommendation (SR), which aims to understand and model the sequential user behaviors and the interactions between users and items over time. Surprisingly, despite the huge success Sequential Recommendation has achieved, there is little study on Sequential Search (SS), a twin learning task that takes into account a user's current and past search queries, in addition to behavior on historical query sessions. The SS learning task is even more important than the counterpart SR task for most of E-commence companies due to its much larger online serving demands as well as traffic volume.
  To this end, we propose a highly scalable hybrid learning model that consists of an RNN learning framework leveraging all features in short-term user-item interactions, and an attention model utilizing selected item-only features from long-term interactions. As a novel optimization step, we fit multiple short user sequences in a single RNN pass within a training batch, by solving a greedy knapsack problem on the fly. Moreover, we explore the use of off-policy reinforcement learning in multi-session personalized search ranking. Specifically, we design a pairwise Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient model that efficiently captures users' long term reward in terms of pairwise classification error. Extensive ablation experiments demonstrate significant improvement each component brings to its state-of-the-art baseline, on a variety of offline and online metrics.

**Abstract:** In this work we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture, ISNet, to solve the task of image segmentation followed by classification, substituting the common pipeline of two networks by a single model. We designed the ISNet for high flexibility and performance: it allows virtually any classification neural network architecture to analyze a common image as if it had been previously segmented. Furthermore, in relation to the original classifier, the ISNet does not cause any increment in computational cost or architectural changes at run-time. To accomplish this, we introduce the concept of optimizing DNNs for relevance segmentation in heatmaps created by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which proves to be equivalent to the classification of previously segmented images. We apply an ISNet based on a DenseNet121 classifier to solve the task of COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays. We compare the model to a U-net (performing lung segmentation) followed by a DenseNet121, and to a standalone DenseNet121. Due to the implicit segmentation, the ISNet precisely ignored the X-ray regions outside of the lungs; it achieved 94.5 +/-4.1% mean accuracy with an external database, showing strong generalization capability and surpassing the other models' performances by 6 to 7.9%. ISNet presents a fast and light methodology to perform classification preceded by segmentation, while also being more accurate than standard pipelines.

**Abstract:** Cyber-resilience is an increasing concern in developing autonomous navigation solutions for marine vessels. This paper scrutinizes cyber-resilience properties of marine navigation through a prism with three edges: multiple sensor information fusion, diagnosis of not-normal behaviours, and change detection. It proposes a two-stage estimator for diagnosis and mitigation of sensor signals used for coastal navigation. Developing a Likelihood Field approach, a first stage extracts shoreline features from radar and matches them to the electronic navigation chart. A second stage associates buoy and beacon features from the radar with chart information. Using real data logged at sea tests combined with simulated spoofing, the paper verifies the ability to timely diagnose and isolate an attempt to compromise position measurements. A new approach is suggested for high level processing of received data to evaluate their consistency, that is agnostic to the underlying technology of the individual sensory input. A combined parametric Gaussian modelling and Kernel Density Estimation is suggested and compared with a generalized likelihood ratio change detector that uses sliding windows. The paper shows how deviations from nominal behaviour and isolation of the components is possible when under attack or when defects in sensors occur.

**Abstract:** With the booming growth of advanced digital technologies, it has become possible for users as well as distributors of energy to obtain detailed and timely information about the electricity consumption of households. These technologies can also be used to forecast the household's electricity consumption (a.k.a. the load). In this paper, we investigate the use of Variational Mode Decomposition and deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the load forecasting problem. Although this problem has been studied in the literature, selecting an appropriate decomposition level and a deep learning technique providing better forecasting performance have garnered comparatively less attention. This study bridges this gap by studying the effect of six decomposition levels and five distinct deep learning networks. The raw load profiles are first decomposed into intrinsic mode functions using the Variational Mode Decomposition in order to mitigate their non-stationary aspect. Then, day, hour, and past electricity consumption data are fed as a three-dimensional input sequence to a four-level Wavelet Decomposition Network model. Finally, the forecast sequences related to the different intrinsic mode functions are combined to form the aggregate forecast sequence. The proposed method was assessed using load profiles of five Moroccan households from the Moroccan buildings' electricity consumption dataset (MORED) and was benchmarked against state-of-the-art time-series models and a baseline persistence model.

**Abstract:** While DeepMind has tentatively solved protein folding, its inverse problem -- protein design which predicts protein sequences from their 3D structures -- still faces significant challenges. Particularly, the lack of large-scale standardized benchmark and poor accuray hinder the research progress. In order to standardize comparisons and draw more research interest, we use AlphaFold DB, one of the world's largest protein structure databases, to establish a new graph-based benchmark -- AlphaDesign. Based on AlphaDesign, we propose a new method called ADesign to improve accuracy by introducing protein angles as new features, using a simplified graph transformer encoder (SGT), and proposing a confidence-aware protein decoder (CPD). Meanwhile, SGT and CPD also improve model efficiency by simplifying the training and testing procedures. Experiments show that ADesign significantly outperforms previous graph models, e.g., the average accuracy is improved by 8\%, and the inference speed is 40+ times faster than before.

<p>

**Abstract:** Tree-based models such as decision trees and random forests (RF) are a cornerstone of modern machine-learning practice. To mitigate overfitting, trees are typically regularized by a variety of techniques that modify their structure (e.g. pruning). We introduce Hierarchical Shrinkage (HS), a post-hoc algorithm that does not modify the tree structure, and instead regularizes the tree by shrinking the prediction over each node towards the sample means of its ancestors. The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a single regularization parameter and the number of data points in each ancestor. Since HS is a post-hoc method, it is extremely fast, compatible with any tree growing algorithm, and can be used synergistically with other regularization techniques. Extensive experiments over a wide variety of real-world datasets show that HS substantially increases the predictive performance of decision trees, even when used in conjunction with other regularization techniques. Moreover, we find that applying HS to each tree in an RF often improves accuracy, as well as its interpretability by simplifying and stabilizing its decision boundaries and SHAP values. We further explain the success of HS in improving prediction performance by showing its equivalence to ridge regression on a (supervised) basis constructed of decision stumps associated with the internal nodes of a tree. All code and models are released in a full-fledged package available on Github (github.com/csinva/imodels)

**Abstract:** We examine the role of textual data as study units when conducting causal inference by drawing parallels between human subjects and organized texts. %in human population research. We elaborate on key causal concepts and principles, and expose some ambiguity and sometimes fallacies. To facilitate better framing a causal query, we discuss two strategies: (i) shifting from immutable traits to perceptions of them, and (ii) shifting from some abstract concept/property to its constituent parts, i.e., adopting a constructivist perspective of an abstract concept. We hope this article would raise the awareness of the importance of articulating and clarifying fundamental concepts before delving into developing methodologies when drawing causal inference using textual data.

**Abstract:** Conducting experiments with objectives that take significant delays to materialize (e.g. conversions, add-to-cart events, etc.) is challenging. Although the classical "split sample testing" is still valid for the delayed feedback, the experiment will take longer to complete, which also means spending more resources on worse-performing strategies due to their fixed allocation schedules. Alternatively, adaptive approaches such as "multi-armed bandits" are able to effectively reduce the cost of experimentation. But these methods generally cannot handle delayed objectives directly out of the box. This paper presents an adaptive experimentation solution tailored for delayed binary feedback objectives by estimating the real underlying objectives before they materialize and dynamically allocating variants based on the estimates. Experiments show that the proposed method is more efficient for delayed feedback compared to various other approaches and is robust in different settings. In addition, we describe an experimentation product powered by this algorithm. This product is currently deployed in the online experimentation platform of JD.com, a large e-commerce company and a publisher of digital ads.

**Abstract:** Differentiable simulators promise faster computation time for reinforcement learning by replacing zeroth-order gradient estimates of a stochastic objective with an estimate based on first-order gradients. However, it is yet unclear what factors decide the performance of the two estimators on complex landscapes that involve long-horizon planning and control on physical systems, despite the crucial relevance of this question for the utility of differentiable simulators. We show that characteristics of certain physical systems, such as stiffness or discontinuities, may compromise the efficacy of the first-order estimator, and analyze this phenomenon through the lens of bias and variance. We additionally propose an $Œ±$-order gradient estimator, with $Œ±\in [0,1]$, which correctly utilizes exact gradients to combine the efficiency of first-order estimates with the robustness of zero-order methods. We demonstrate the pitfalls of traditional estimators and the advantages of the $Œ±$-order estimator on some numerical examples.

**Abstract:** Multiplexed immunofluorescence provides an unprecedented opportunity for studying specific cell-to-cell and cell microenvironment interactions. We employ graph neural networks to combine features obtained from tissue morphology with measurements of protein expression to profile the tumour microenvironment associated with different tumour stages. Our framework presents a new approach to analysing and processing these complex multi-dimensional datasets that overcomes some of the key challenges in analysing these data and opens up the opportunity to abstract biologically meaningful interactions.

**Abstract:** Approximating probability distributions can be a challenging task, particularly when they are supported over regions of high geometrical complexity or exhibit multiple modes. Annealing can be used to facilitate this task which is often combined with constant a priori selected increments in inverse temperature. However, using constant increments limit the computational efficiency due to the inability to adapt to situations where smooth changes in the annealed density could be handled equally well with larger increments. We introduce AdaAnn, an adaptive annealing scheduler that automatically adjusts the temperature increments based on the expected change in the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions with a sufficiently close annealing temperature. AdaAnn is easy to implement and can be integrated into existing sampling approaches such as normalizing flows for variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the AdaAnn scheduler for variational inference with normalizing flows on a number of examples, including density approximation and parameter estimation for dynamical systems.

**Abstract:** We study the faithfulness of an explanation system to the underlying prediction model. We show that this can be captured by two properties, consistency and sufficiency, and introduce quantitative measures of the extent to which these hold. Interestingly, these measures depend on the test-time data distribution. For a variety of existing explanation systems, such as anchors, we analytically study these quantities. We also provide estimators and sample complexity bounds for empirically determining the faithfulness of black-box explanation systems. Finally, we experimentally validate the new properties and estimators.

**Abstract:** We propose a general approach for distance based clustering, using the gradient of the cost function that measures clustering quality with respect to cluster assignments and cluster center positions. The approach is an iterative two step procedure (alternating between cluster assignment and cluster center updates) and is applicable to a wide range of functions, satisfying some mild assumptions. The main advantage of the proposed approach is a simple and computationally cheap update rule. Unlike previous methods that specialize to a specific formulation of the clustering problem, our approach is applicable to a wide range of costs, including non-Bregman clustering methods based on the Huber loss. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and show that it converges to the set of appropriately defined fixed points, under arbitrary center initialization. In the special case of Bregman cost functions, the algorithm converges to the set of centroidal Voronoi partitions, which is consistent with prior works. Numerical experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** In medical imaging, most of the image registration methods implicitly assume a one-to-one correspondence between the source and target images (i.e., diffeomorphism). However, this is not necessarily the case when dealing with pathological medical images (e.g., presence of a tumor, lesion, etc.). To cope with this issue, the Metamorphosis model has been proposed. It modifies both the shape and the appearance of an image to deal with the geometrical and topological differences. However, the high computational time and load have hampered its applications so far. Here, we propose a deep residual learning implementation of Metamorphosis that drastically reduces the computational time at inference. Furthermore, we also show that the proposed framework can easily integrate prior knowledge of the localization of topological changes (e.g., segmentation masks) that can act as spatial regularization to correctly disentangle appearance and shape changes. We test our method on the BraTS 2021 dataset, showing that it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the alignment of images with brain tumors.

**Abstract:** Diffeomorphic deformable image registration is one of the crucial tasks in medical image analysis, which aims to find a unique transformation while preserving the topology and invertibility of the transformation. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have yielded well-suited approaches for image registration by learning the transformation priors from a large dataset. The improvement in the performance of these methods is related to their ability to learn information from several sample medical images that are difficult to obtain and bias the framework to the specific domain of data. In this paper, we propose a novel diffeomorphic training-free approach; this is built upon the principle of an ordinary differential equation.
  Our formulation yields an Euler integration type recursive scheme to estimate the changes of spatial transformations between the fixed and the moving image pyramids at different resolutions. The proposed architecture is simple in design. The moving image is warped successively at each resolution and finally aligned to the fixed image; this procedure is recursive in a way that at each resolution, a fully convolutional network (FCN) models a progressive change of deformation for the current warped image. The entire system is end-to-end and optimized for each pair of images from scratch. In comparison to learning-based methods, the proposed method neither requires a dedicated training set nor suffers from any training bias. We evaluate our method on three cardiac image datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy while maintaining desirable diffeomorphic properties.

**Abstract:** The field of social robotics will likely need to depart from a paradigm of designed behaviours and imitation learning and adopt modern reinforcement learning (RL) methods to enable robots to interact fluidly and efficaciously with humans. In this paper, we present the Social Reward Function as a mechanism to provide (1) a real-time, dense reward function necessary for the deployment of RL agents in social robotics, and (2) a standardised objective metric for comparing the efficacy of different social robots. The Social Reward Function is designed to closely mimic those genetically endowed social perception capabilities of humans in an effort to provide a simple, stable and culture-agnostic reward function. Presently, datasets used in social robotics are either small or significantly out-of-domain with respect to social robotics. The use of the Social Reward Function will allow larger in-domain datasets to be collected close to the behaviour policy of social robots, which will allow both further improvements to reward functions and to the behaviour policies of social robots. We believe this will be the key enabler to developing efficacious social robots in the future.

**Abstract:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal comprises physiological information related to cardiorespiratory health. However, while recording, these PPG signals are easily corrupted by motion artifacts and body movements, leading to noise enriched, poor quality signals. Therefore ensuring high-quality signals is necessary to extract cardiorespiratory information accurately. Although there exists several rule-based and Machine-Learning (ML) - based approaches for PPG signal quality estimation, those algorithms' efficacy is questionable. Thus, this work proposes a lightweight CNN architecture for signal quality assessment employing a novel Quantum pattern recognition (QPR) technique. The proposed algorithm is validated on manually annotated data obtained from the University of Queensland database. A total of 28366, 5s signal segments are preprocessed and transformed into image files of 20 x 500 pixels. The image files are treated as an input to the 2D CNN architecture. The developed model classifies the PPG signal as `good' or `bad' with an accuracy of 98.3% with 99.3% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity and 98.9% F1-score. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is validated against the noisy `Welltory app' collected PPG database. Even in a noisy environment, the proposed architecture proved its competence. Experimental analysis concludes that a slim architecture along with a novel Spatio-temporal pattern recognition technique improve the system's performance. Hence, the proposed approach can be useful to classify good and bad PPG signals for a resource-constrained wearable implementation.

**Abstract:** Pauli spin blockade (PSB) can be employed as a great resource for spin qubit initialisation and readout even at elevated temperatures but it can be difficult to identify. We present a machine learning algorithm capable of automatically identifying PSB using charge transport measurements. The scarcity of PSB data is circumvented by training the algorithm with simulated data and by using cross-device validation. We demonstrate our approach on a silicon field-effect transistor device and report an accuracy of 96% on different test devices, giving evidence that the approach is robust to device variability. The approach is expected to be employable across all types of quantum dot devices.

**Abstract:** Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) is widely used to analyze overparametrized neural networks due to the famous result by (Jacot et al., 2018): in the infinite-width limit, the NTK is deterministic and constant during training. However, this result cannot explain the behavior of deep networks, since it generally does not hold if depth and width tend to infinity simultaneously. In this paper, we study the NTK of fully-connected ReLU networks with depth comparable to width. We prove that the NTK properties depend significantly on the depth-to-width ratio and the distribution of parameters at initialization. In fact, our results indicate the importance of the three phases in the hyperparameter space identified in (Poole et al., 2016): ordered, chaotic and the edge of chaos (EOC). We derive exact expressions for the NTK dispersion in the infinite-depth-and-width limit in all three phases and conclude that the NTK variability grows exponentially with depth at the EOC and in the chaotic phase but not in the ordered phase. We also show that the NTK of deep networks may stay constant during training only in the ordered phase and discuss how the structure of the NTK matrix changes during training.

**Abstract:** This paper studies decentralized convex-concave minimax optimization problems of the form $\min_x\max_y f(x,y) \triangleq\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(x,y)$, where $m$ is the number of agents and each local function can be written as $f_i(x,y)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n f_{i,j}(x,y)$. We propose a novel decentralized optimization algorithm, called multi-consensus stochastic variance reduced extragradient, which achieves the best known stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity for this problem. Specifically, each agent requires $\mathcal O((n+Œ∫\sqrt{n})\log(1/\varepsilon))$ SFO calls for strongly-convex-strongly-concave problem and $\mathcal O((n+\sqrt{n}L/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ SFO call for general convex-concave problem to achieve $\varepsilon$-accurate solution in expectation, where $Œ∫$ is the condition number and $L$ is the smoothness parameter. The numerical experiments show the proposed method performs better than baselines.

**Abstract:** Patient-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contains a complex biological cargo is a valuable source of liquid biopsy diagnostics to aid in early detection, cancer screening, and precision nanotherapeutics. In this study, we predicted that coupling cancer patient blood-derived EVs to time-resolved spectroscopy and artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a robust cancer screening and follow-up tools. Methods: Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements were performed on 24 blood samples-derived EVs. Blood samples were obtained from 15 cancer patients (presenting 5 different types of cancers), and 9 healthy controls (including patients with benign lesions). The obtained FCS autocorrelation spectra were processed into power spectra using the Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm and subjected to various machine learning algorithms to distinguish cancer spectra from healthy control spectra. Results and Applications: The performance of AdaBoost Random Forest (RF) classifier, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, were tested on selected frequencies in the N=118 power spectra. The RF classifier exhibited a 90% classification accuracy and high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing the FCS power spectra of cancer patients from those of healthy controls. Further, an image convolutional neural network (CNN), ResNet network, and a quantum CNN were assessed on the power spectral images as additional validation tools. All image-based CNNs exhibited a nearly equal classification performance with an accuracy of roughly 82% and reasonably high sensitivity and specificity scores. Our pilot study demonstrates that AI-algorithms coupled to time-resolved FCS power spectra can accurately and differentially classify the complex patient-derived EVs from different cancer samples of distinct tissue subtypes.

**Abstract:** With a variety of local feature attribution methods being proposed in recent years, follow-up work suggested several evaluation strategies. To assess the attribution quality across different attribution techniques, the most popular among these evaluation strategies in the image domain use pixel perturbations. However, recent advances discovered that different evaluation strategies produce conflicting rankings of attribution methods and can be prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work, we present an information-theoretic analysis of evaluation strategies based on pixel perturbations. Our findings reveal that the results output by different evaluation strategies are strongly affected by information leakage through the shape of the removed pixels as opposed to their actual values. Using our theoretical insights, we propose a novel evaluation framework termed Remove and Debias (ROAD) which offers two contributions: First, it mitigates the impact of the confounders, which entails higher consistency among evaluation strategies. Second, ROAD does not require the computationally expensive retraining step and saves up to 99% in computational costs compared to the state-of-the-art. Our source code is available at https://github.com/tleemann/road_evaluation.

**Abstract:** There is a fundamental limitation in the prediction performance that a machine learning model can achieve due to the inevitable uncertainty of the prediction target. In classification problems, this can be characterized by the Bayes error, which is the best achievable error with any classifier. The Bayes error can be used as a criterion to evaluate classifiers with state-of-the-art performance and can be used to detect test set overfitting. We propose a simple and direct Bayes error estimator, where we just take the mean of the labels that show \emph{uncertainty} of the classes. Our flexible approach enables us to perform Bayes error estimation even for weakly supervised data. In contrast to others, our method is model-free and even instance-free. Moreover, it has no hyperparameters and gives a more accurate estimate of the Bayes error than classifier-based baselines. Experiments using our method suggest that a recently proposed classifier, the Vision Transformer, may have already reached the Bayes error for certain benchmark datasets.

**Abstract:** Learning arguments is highly relevant to the field of explainable artificial intelligence. It is a family of symbolic machine learning techniques that is particularly human-interpretable. These techniques learn a set of arguments as an intermediate representation. Arguments are small rules with exceptions that can be chained to larger arguments for making predictions or decisions. We investigate the learning of arguments, specifically the learning of arguments from a 'case model' proposed by Verheij [34]. The case model in Verheij's approach are cases or scenarios in a legal setting. The number of cases in a case model are relatively low. Here, we investigate whether Verheij's approach can be used for learning arguments from other types of data sets with a much larger number of instances. We compare the learning of arguments from a case model with the HeRO algorithm [15] and learning a decision tree.

**Abstract:** Geometric deep learning has sparked a rising interest in computer graphics to perform shape understanding tasks, such as shape classification and semantic segmentation on three-dimensional (3D) geometric surfaces. Previous works explored the significant direction by defining the operations of convolution and pooling on triangle meshes, but most methods explicitly utilized the graph connection structure of the mesh. Motivated by the geometric spectral surface reconstruction theory, we introduce a novel and flexible convolutional neural network (CNN) model, called Laplacian2Mesh, for 3D triangle mesh, which maps the features of mesh in the Euclidean space to the multi-dimensional Laplacian-Beltrami space, which is similar to the multi-resolution input in 2D CNN. Mesh pooling is applied to expand the receptive field of the network by the multi-space transformation of Laplacian which retains the surface topology, and channel self-attention convolutions are applied in the new space. Since implicitly using the intrinsic geodesic connections of the mesh through the adjacency matrix, we do not consider the number of the neighbors of the vertices, thereby mesh data with different numbers of vertices can be input. Experiments on various learning tasks applied to 3D meshes demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Laplacian2Mesh.

Moreover, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional extraction of the characteristics of the question by combining multiple neural network models, and proposes a question classification model based on multi-dimensional feature extraction.

**Abstract:** The imitation learning research community has recently made significant progress towards the goal of enabling artificial agents to imitate behaviors from video demonstrations alone. However, current state-of-the-art approaches developed for this problem exhibit high sample complexity due, in part, to the high-dimensional nature of video observations. Towards addressing this issue, we introduce here a new algorithm called Visual Generative Adversarial Imitation from Observation using a State Observer VGAIfO-SO. At its core, VGAIfO-SO seeks to address sample inefficiency using a novel, self-supervised state observer, which provides estimates of lower-dimensional proprioceptive state representations from high-dimensional images. We show experimentally in several continuous control environments that VGAIfO-SO is more sample efficient than other IfO algorithms at learning from video-only demonstrations and can sometimes even achieve performance close to the Generative Adversarial Imitation from Observation (GAIfO) algorithm that has privileged access to the demonstrator's proprioceptive state information.

**Abstract:** While extensive-form games (EFGs) can be converted into normal-form games (NFGs), doing so comes at the cost of an exponential blowup of the strategy space. So, progress on NFGs and EFGs has historically followed separate tracks, with the EFG community often having to catch up with advances (e.g., last-iterate convergence and predictive regret bounds) from the larger NFG community. In this paper we show that the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU) algorithm -- the premier learning algorithm for NFGs -- can be simulated on the normal-form equivalent of an EFG in linear time per iteration in the game tree size using a kernel trick. The resulting algorithm, Kernelized OMWU (KOMWU), applies more broadly to all convex games whose strategy space is a polytope with 0/1 integral vertices, as long as the kernel can be evaluated efficiently. In the particular case of EFGs, KOMWU closes several standing gaps between NFG and EFG learning, by enabling direct, black-box transfer to EFGs of desirable properties of learning dynamics that were so far known to be achievable only in NFGs. Specifically, KOMWU gives the first algorithm that guarantees at the same time last-iterate convergence, lower dependence on the size of the game tree than all prior algorithms, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ regret when followed by all players.

**Abstract:** Despite the great potential of machine learning, the lack of generalizability has hindered the widespread adoption of these technologies in routine clinical practice. We investigate three methodological pitfalls: (1) violation of independence assumption, (2) model evaluation with an inappropriate performance indicator, and (3) batch effect and how these pitfalls could affect the generalizability of machine learning models. We implement random forest and deep convolutional neural network models using several medical imaging datasets, including head and neck CT, lung CT, chest X-Ray, and histopathological images, to quantify and illustrate the effect of these pitfalls. We develop these models with and without the pitfall and compare the performance of the resulting models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results showed that violation of the independence assumption could substantially affect model generalizability. More specifically, (I) applying oversampling before splitting data into train, validation and test sets; (II) performing data augmentation before splitting data; (III) distributing data points for a subject across training, validation, and test sets; and (IV) applying feature selection before splitting data led to superficial boosts in model performance. We also observed that inappropriate performance indicators could lead to erroneous conclusions. Also, batch effect could lead to developing models that lack generalizability. The aforementioned methodological pitfalls lead to machine learning models with over-optimistic performance. These errors, if made, cannot be captured using internal model evaluation, and the inaccurate predictions made by the model may lead to wrong conclusions and interpretations. Therefore, avoiding these pitfalls is a necessary condition for developing generalizable models.

**Abstract:** Contextual bandits are widely-used in the study of learning-based control policies for finite action spaces. While the problem is well-studied for bandits with perfectly observed context vectors, little is known about the case of imperfectly observed contexts. For this setting, existing approaches are inapplicable and new conceptual and technical frameworks are required. We present an implementable posterior sampling algorithm for bandits with imperfect context observations and study its performance for learning optimal decisions. The provided numerical results relate the performance of the algorithm to different quantities of interest including the number of arms, dimensions, observation matrices, posterior rescaling factors, and signal-to-noise ratios. In general, the proposed algorithm exposes efficiency in learning from the noisy imperfect observations and taking actions accordingly. Enlightening understandings the analyses provide as well as interesting future directions it points to, are discussed as well.

**Abstract:** Bayesian approaches developed to solve the optimal design of sequential experiments are mathematically elegant but computationally challenging. Recently, techniques using amortization have been proposed to make these Bayesian approaches practical, by training a parameterized policy that proposes designs efficiently at deployment time. However, these methods may not sufficiently explore the design space, require access to a differentiable probabilistic model and can only optimize over continuous design spaces. Here, we address these limitations by showing that the problem of optimizing policies can be reduced to solving a Markov decision process (MDP). We solve the equivalent MDP with modern deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our experiments show that our approach is also computationally efficient at deployment time and exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both continuous and discrete design spaces, even when the probabilistic model is a black box.

**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) has been developed as a promising framework to leverage the resources of edge devices, enhance customers' privacy, comply with regulations, and reduce development costs. Although many methods and applications have been developed for FL, several critical challenges for practical FL systems remain unaddressed. This paper provides an outlook on FL development, categorized into five emerging directions of FL, namely algorithm foundation, personalization, hardware and security constraints, lifelong learning, and nonstandard data. Our unique perspectives are backed by practical observations from large-scale federated systems for edge devices.

**Abstract:** Mining the latent intentions from large volumes of natural language inputs is a key step to help data analysts design and refine Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) for customer service. To aid data analysts in this task we present Verint Intent Manager (VIM), an analysis platform that combines unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to help analysts quickly surface and organize relevant user intentions from conversational texts. For the initial exploration of data we make use of a novel unsupervised and semi-supervised pipeline that integrates the fine-tuning of high performing language models, a distributed k-NN graph building method and community detection techniques for mining the intentions and topics from texts. The fine-tuning step is necessary because pre-trained language models cannot encode texts to efficiently surface particular clustering structures when the target texts are from an unseen domain or the clustering task is not topic detection. For flexibility we deploy two clustering approaches: where the number of clusters must be specified and where the number of clusters is detected automatically with comparable clustering quality but at the expense of additional computation time. We describe the application and deployment and demonstrate its performance using BERT on three text mining tasks. Our experiments show that BERT begins to produce better task-aware representations using a labeled subset as small as 0.5% of the task data. The clustering quality exceeds the state-of-the-art results when BERT is fine-tuned with labeled subsets of only 2.5% of the task data. As deployed in the VIM application, this flexible clustering pipeline produces high quality results, improving the performance of data analysts and reducing the time it takes to surface intentions from customer service data, thereby reducing the time it takes to build and deploy IVAs in new domains.

**Abstract:** We show that typical implicit regularization assumptions for deep neural networks (for regression) do not hold for coordinate-MLPs, a family of MLPs that are now ubiquitous in computer vision for representing high-frequency signals. Lack of such implicit bias disrupts smooth interpolations between training samples, and hampers generalizing across signal regions with different spectra. We investigate this behavior through a Fourier lens and uncover that as the bandwidth of a coordinate-MLP is enhanced, lower frequencies tend to get suppressed unless a suitable prior is provided explicitly. Based on these insights, we propose a simple regularization technique that can mitigate the above problem, which can be incorporated into existing networks without any architectural modifications.

**Abstract:** Weight pruning is a technique to make Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference more computationally efficient by reducing the number of model parameters over the course of training. However, most weight pruning techniques generally does not speed up DNN training and can even require more iterations to reach model convergence. In this work, we propose a novel Structured Data Gradient Pruning (SDGP) method that can speed up training without impacting model convergence. This approach enforces a specific sparsity structure, where only N out of every M elements in a matrix can be nonzero, making it amenable to hardware acceleration. Modern accelerators such as the Nvidia A100 GPU support this type of structured sparsity for 2 nonzeros per 4 elements in a reduction. Assuming hardware support for 2:4 sparsity, our approach can achieve a 15-25\% reduction in total training time without significant impact to performance.

**Abstract:** The efficiency of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) depends on how the underlying geometry of the problem is taken into account. For distributions with strongly varying curvature, Riemannian metrics help in efficient exploration of the target distribution. Unfortunately, they have significant computational overhead due to e.g. repeated inversion of the metric tensor, and current geometric MCMC methods using the Fisher information matrix to induce the manifold are in practice slow. We propose a new alternative Riemannian metric for MCMC, by embedding the target distribution into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space as a Monge patch and using the induced metric determined by direct geometric reasoning. Our metric only requires first-order gradient information and has fast inverse and determinants, and allows reducing the computational complexity of individual iterations from cubic to quadratic in the problem dimensionality. We demonstrate how Lagrangian Monte Carlo in this metric efficiently explores the target distributions.

**Abstract:** We present a postprocessing layer for deformable image registration to make a registration field more diffeomorphic by encouraging Jacobians of the transformation to be positive. Diffeomorphic image registration is important for medical imaging studies because of the properties like invertibility, smoothness of the transformation, and topology preservation/non-folding of the grid. Violation of these properties can lead to destruction of the neighbourhood and the connectivity of anatomical structures during image registration. Most of the recent deep learning methods do not explicitly address this folding problem and try to solve it with a smoothness regularization on the registration field. In this paper, we propose a differentiable layer, which takes any registration field as its input, computes exponential of the Jacobian matrices of the input and reconstructs a new registration field from the exponentiated Jacobian matrices using Poisson reconstruction. Our proposed Poisson reconstruction loss enforces positive Jacobians for the final registration field. Thus, our method acts as a post-processing layer without any learnable parameters of its own and can be placed at the end of any deep learning pipeline to form an end-to-end learnable framework. We show the effectiveness of our proposed method for a popular deep learning registration method Voxelmorph and evaluate it with a dataset containing 3D brain MRI scans. Our results show that our post-processing can effectively decrease the number of non-positive Jacobians by a significant amount without any noticeable deterioration of the registration accuracy, thus making the registration field more diffeomorphic.

**Abstract:** As customized accelerator design has become increasingly popular to keep up with the demand for high performance computing, it poses challenges for modern simulator design to adapt to such a large variety of accelerators. Existing simulators tend to two extremes: low-level and general approaches, such as RTL simulation, that can model any hardware but require substantial effort and long execution times; and higher-level application-specific models that can be much faster and easier to use but require one-off engineering effort.
  This work proposes a compiler-driven simulation workflow that can model configurable hardware accelerator. The key idea is to separate structure representation from simulation by developing an intermediate language that can flexibly represent a wide variety of hardware constructs. We design the Event Queue (EQueue) dialect of MLIR, a dialect that can model arbitrary hardware accelerators with explicit data movement and distributed event-based control; we also implement a generic simulation engine to model EQueue programs with hybrid MLIR dialects representing different abstraction levels. We demonstrate two case studies of EQueue-implemented accelerators: the systolic array of convolution and SIMD processors in a modern FPGA. In the former we show EQueue simulation is as accurate as a state-of-the-art simulator, while offering higher extensibility and lower iteration cost via compiler passes. In the latter we demonstrate our simulation flow can guide designer efficiently improve their design using visualizable simulation outputs.

**Abstract:** Much of recent Deep Reinforcement Learning success is owed to the neural architecture's potential to learn and use effective internal representations of the world. While many current algorithms access a simulator to train with a large amount of data, in realistic settings, including while playing games that may be played against people, collecting experience can be quite costly. In this paper, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning architecture whose purpose is to increase sample efficiency without sacrificing performance. We design this architecture by incorporating advances achieved in recent years in the field of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Specifically, we propose a visually attentive model that uses transformers to learn a self-attention mechanism on the feature maps of the state representation, while simultaneously optimizing return. We demonstrate empirically that this architecture improves sample complexity for several Atari environments, while also achieving better performance in some of the games.

**Abstract:** In logistic regression, it is often desirable to utilize regularization to promote sparse solutions, particularly for problems with a large number of features compared to available labels. In this paper, we present screening rules that safely remove features from logistic regression with $\ell_0-\ell_2$ regularization before solving the problem. The proposed safe screening rules are based on lower bounds from the Fenchel dual of strong conic relaxations of the logistic regression problem. Numerical experiments with real and synthetic data suggest that a high percentage of the features can be effectively and safely removed apriori, leading to substantial speed-up in the computations.

**Abstract:** Intra retinal fluids or Cysts are one of the important symptoms of macular pathologies that are efficiently visualized in OCT images. Automatic segmentation of these abnormalities has been widely investigated in medical image processing studies. In this paper, we propose a new U-Net-based approach for Intra retinal cyst segmentation across different vendors that improves some of the challenges faced by previous deep-based techniques. The proposed method has two main steps: 1- prior information embedding and input data adjustment, and 2- IRC segmentation model. In the first step, we inject the information into the network in a way that overcomes some of the network limitations in receiving data and learning important contextual knowledge. And in the next step, we introduced a connection module between encoder and decoder parts of the standard U-Net architecture that transfers information more effectively from the encoder to the decoder part. Two public datasets namely OPTIMA and KERMANY were employed to evaluate the proposed method. Results showed that the proposed method is an efficient vendor-independent approach for IRC segmentation with mean Dice values of 0.78 and 0.81 on the OPTIMA and KERMANY datasets, respectively.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present CAESR, an hybrid learning-based coding approach for spatial scalability based on the versatile video coding (VVC) standard. Our framework considers a low-resolution signal encoded with VVC intra-mode as a base-layer (BL), and a deep conditional autoencoder with hyperprior (AE-HP) as an enhancement-layer (EL) model. The EL encoder takes as inputs both the upscaled BL reconstruction and the original image. Our approach relies on conditional coding that learns the optimal mixture of the source and the upscaled BL image, enabling better performance than residual coding. On the decoder side, a super-resolution (SR) module is used to recover high-resolution details and invert the conditional coding process. Experimental results have shown that our solution is competitive with the VVC full-resolution intra coding while being scalable.

**Abstract:** The recent growth of emergent network applications (e.g., satellite networks, vehicular networks) is increasing the complexity of managing modern communication networks. As a result, the community proposed the Digital Twin Networks (DTN) as a key enabler of efficient network management. Network operators can leverage the DTN to perform different optimization tasks (e.g., Traffic Engineering, Network Planning). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) showed a high performance when applied to solve network optimization problems. In the context of DTN, DRL can be leveraged to solve optimization problems without directly impacting the real-world network behavior. However, DRL scales poorly with the problem size and complexity. In this paper, we explore the use of Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to train DRL agents for solving a routing optimization problem. The experimental results show that ES achieved a training time speed-up of 128 and 6 for the NSFNET and GEANT2 topologies respectively.

**Abstract:** Quantum technologies require methods for preparing and manipulating entangled multiparticle states. However, the problem of determining whether a given quantum state is entangled or separable is known to be an NP-hard problem in general, and even the task of detecting entanglement breakdown for a given class of quantum states is difficult. In this work, we develop an approach for revealing entanglement breakdown using a machine learning technique, which is known as 'learning by confusion'. We consider a family of quantum states, which is parameterized such that there is a single critical value dividing states within this family on separate and entangled. We demonstrate the 'learning by confusion' scheme allows determining the critical value. Specifically, we study the performance of the method for the two-qubit, two-qutrit, and two-ququart entangled state, where the standard entanglement measures do not work efficiently. In addition, we investigate the properties of the local depolarization and the generalized amplitude damping channel in the framework of the confusion scheme. Within our approach and setting the parameterization of special trajectories to construct W shapes, we obtain an entanglement-breakdown 'phase diagram' of a quantum channel, which indicates regions of entangled (separable) states and the entanglement-breakdown region. Then we extend the way of using the 'learning by confusion' scheme for recognizing whether an arbitrary given state is entangled or separable. We show that the developed method provides correct answers for a variety of states, including entangled states with positive partial transpose (PPT). We also present a more practical version of the method, which is suitable for studying entanglement breakdown in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We demonstrate its performance using an available cloud-based IBM quantum processor.

**Abstract:** Surrogate gradient (SG) training provides the possibility to quickly transfer all the gains made in deep learning to neuromorphic computing and neuromorphic processors, with the consequent reduction in energy consumption. Evidence supports that training can be robust to the choice of SG shape, after an extensive search of hyper-parameters. However, random or grid search of hyper-parameters becomes exponentially unfeasible as we consider more hyper-parameters. Moreover, every point in the search can itself be highly time and energy consuming for large networks and large datasets. In this article we show how complex tasks and networks are more sensitive to SG choice. Secondly, we show how low dampening, high sharpness and low tail fatness are preferred. Thirdly, we observe that Glorot Uniform initialization is generally preferred by most SG choices, with variability in the results. We finally provide a theoretical solution to reduce the need of extensive gridsearch, to find SG shape and initializations that result in improved accuracy.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we question the rationale behind propagating large numbers of parameters through a distributed system during federated learning. We start by examining the rank characteristics of the subspace spanned by gradients across epochs (i.e., the gradient-space) in centralized model training, and observe that this gradient-space often consists of a few leading principal components accounting for an overwhelming majority (95-99%) of the explained variance. Motivated by this, we propose the "Look-back Gradient Multiplier" (LBGM) algorithm, which exploits this low-rank property to enable gradient recycling between model update rounds of federated learning, reducing transmissions of large parameters to single scalars for aggregation. We analytically characterize the convergence behavior of LBGM, revealing the nature of the trade-off between communication savings and model performance. Our subsequent experimental results demonstrate the improvement LBGM obtains in communication overhead compared to conventional federated learning on several datasets and deep learning models. Additionally, we show that LBGM is a general plug-and-play algorithm that can be used standalone or stacked on top of existing sparsification techniques for distributed model training.

The use of encrypted images or encrypted feature maps has been demonstrated to be effective in access control of models from unauthorized access. However, the effectiveness of the approach has been confirmed in only image classification models and semantic segmentation models, but not in object detection models. In this paper, the use of encrypted feature maps is shown to be effective in access control of object detection models for the first time.

**Abstract:** We describe a graph-based neural acceleration technique for nonnegative matrix factorization that builds upon a connection between matrices and bipartite graphs that is well-known in certain fields, e.g., sparse linear algebra, but has not yet been exploited to design graph neural networks for matrix computations. We first consider low-rank factorization more broadly and propose a graph representation of the problem suited for graph neural networks. Then, we focus on the task of nonnegative matrix factorization and propose a graph neural network that interleaves bipartite self-attention layers with updates based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our empirical evaluation on synthetic and two real-world datasets shows that we attain substantial acceleration, even though we only train in an unsupervised fashion on smaller synthetic instances.
