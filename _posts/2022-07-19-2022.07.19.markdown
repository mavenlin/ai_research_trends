**Abstract:** We approach the problem of learning by watching humans in the wild. While traditional approaches in Imitation and Reinforcement Learning are promising for learning in the real world, they are either sample inefficient or are constrained to lab settings. Meanwhile, there has been a lot of success in processing passive, unstructured human data. We propose tackling this problem via an efficient one-shot robot learning algorithm, centered around learning from a third-person perspective. We call our method WHIRL: In-the-Wild Human Imitating Robot Learning. WHIRL extracts a prior over the intent of the human demonstrator, using it to initialize our agent's policy. We introduce an efficient real-world policy learning scheme that improves using interactions. Our key contributions are a simple sampling-based policy optimization approach, a novel objective function for aligning human and robot videos as well as an exploration method to boost sample efficiency. We show one-shot generalization and success in real-world settings, including 20 different manipulation tasks in the wild. Videos and talk at https://human2robot.github.io

**Abstract:** In this paper, we examine self-supervised learning methods, particularly VICReg, to provide an information-theoretical understanding of their construction. As a first step, we demonstrate how information-theoretic quantities can be obtained for a deterministic network, offering a possible alternative to prior work that relies on stochastic models. This enables us to demonstrate how VICReg can be (re)discovered from first principles and its assumptions about data distribution. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the validity of our assumptions, confirming our novel understanding of VICReg. Finally, we believe that the derivation and insights we obtain can be generalized to many other SSL methods, opening new avenues for theoretical and practical understanding of SSL and transfer learning.

**Abstract:** We present the Caltech Fish Counting Dataset (CFC), a large-scale dataset for detecting, tracking, and counting fish in sonar videos. We identify sonar videos as a rich source of data for advancing low signal-to-noise computer vision applications and tackling domain generalization in multiple-object tracking (MOT) and counting. In comparison to existing MOT and counting datasets, which are largely restricted to videos of people and vehicles in cities, CFC is sourced from a natural-world domain where targets are not easily resolvable and appearance features cannot be easily leveraged for target re-identification. With over half a million annotations in over 1,500 videos sourced from seven different sonar cameras, CFC allows researchers to train MOT and counting algorithms and evaluate generalization performance at unseen test locations. We perform extensive baseline experiments and identify key challenges and opportunities for advancing the state of the art in generalization in MOT and counting.

<p>

**Abstract:** We present Theseus, an efficient application-agnostic open source library for differentiable nonlinear least squares (DNLS) optimization built on PyTorch, providing a common framework for end-to-end structured learning in robotics and vision. Existing DNLS implementations are application specific and do not always incorporate many ingredients important for efficiency. Theseus is application-agnostic, as we illustrate with several example applications that are built using the same underlying differentiable components, such as second-order optimizers, standard costs functions, and Lie groups. For efficiency, Theseus incorporates support for sparse solvers, automatic vectorization, batching, GPU acceleration, and gradient computation with implicit differentiation and direct loss minimization. We do extensive performance evaluation in a set of applications, demonstrating significant efficiency gains and better scalability when these features are incorporated.

<p>

**Abstract:** Estimating the pose of a moving camera from monocular video is a challenging problem, especially due to the presence of moving objects in dynamic environments, where the performance of existing camera pose estimation methods are susceptible to pixels that are not geometrically consistent. To tackle this challenge, we present a robust dense indirect structure-from-motion method for videos that is based on dense correspondence initialized from pairwise optical flow. Our key idea is to optimize long-range video correspondence as dense point trajectories and use it to learn robust estimation of motion segmentation. A novel neural network architecture is proposed for processing irregular point trajectory data. Camera poses are then estimated and optimized with global bundle adjustment over the portion of long-range point trajectories that are classified as static. Experiments on MPI Sintel dataset show that our system produces significantly more accurate camera trajectories compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our method is able to retain reasonable accuracy of camera poses on fully static scenes, which consistently outperforms strong state-of-the-art dense correspondence based methods with end-to-end deep learning, demonstrating the potential of dense indirect methods based on optical flow and point trajectories. As the point trajectory representation is general, we further present results and comparisons on in-the-wild monocular videos with complex motion of dynamic objects.

<p>

**Abstract:** We consider some classical optimization problems in path planning and network transport, and we introduce new auction-based algorithms for their optimal and suboptimal solution. The algorithms are based on mathematical ideas that are related to competitive bidding by persons for objects and the attendant market equilibrium, which underlie auction processes. However, the starting point of our algorithms is different, namely weighted and unweighted path construction in directed graphs, rather than assignment of persons to objects. The new algorithms have several potential advantages over existing methods: they are empirically faster in some important contexts, such as max-flow, they are well-suited for on-line replanning, and they can be adapted to distributed asynchronous operation. Moreover, they allow arbitrary initial prices, without complementary slackness restrictions, and thus are better-suited to take advantage of reinforcement learning methods that use off-line training with data, as well as on-line training during real-time operation. The new algorithms may also find use in reinforcement learning contexts involving approximation, such as multistep lookahead and tree search schemes, and/or rollout algorithms.

<p>

**Abstract:** Since out-of-distribution generalization is a generally ill-posed problem, various proxy targets (e.g., calibration, adversarial robustness, algorithmic corruptions, invariance across shifts) were studied across different research programs resulting in different recommendations. While sharing the same aspirational goal, these approaches have never been tested under the same experimental conditions on real data. In this paper, we take a unified view of previous work, highlighting message discrepancies that we address empirically, and providing recommendations on how to measure the robustness of a model and how to improve it. To this end, we collect 172 publicly available dataset pairs for training and out-of-distribution evaluation of accuracy, calibration error, adversarial attacks, environment invariance, and synthetic corruptions. We fine-tune over 31k networks, from nine different architectures in the many- and few-shot setting. Our findings confirm that in- and out-of-distribution accuracies tend to increase jointly, but show that their relation is largely dataset-dependent, and in general more nuanced and more complex than posited by previous, smaller scale studies.

<p>

**Abstract:** This paper presents recent progress on integrating speech separation and enhancement (SSE) into the ESPnet toolkit. Compared with the previous ESPnet-SE work, numerous features have been added, including recent state-of-the-art speech enhancement models with their respective training and evaluation recipes. Importantly, a new interface has been designed to flexibly combine speech enhancement front-ends with other tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and spoken language understanding (SLU). To showcase such integration, we performed experiments on carefully designed synthetic datasets for noisy-reverberant multi-channel ST and SLU tasks, which can be used as benchmark corpora for future research. In addition to these new tasks, we also use CHiME-4 and WSJ0-2Mix to benchmark multi- and single-channel SE approaches. Results show that the integration of SE front-ends with back-end tasks is a promising research direction even for tasks besides ASR, especially in the multi-channel scenario. The code is available online at https://github.com/ESPnet/ESPnet. The multi-channel ST and SLU datasets, which are another contribution of this work, are released on HuggingFace.

<p>

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of human-machine collaborative problem solving as a planning task coupled with natural language communication. Our framework consists of three components -- a natural language engine that parses the language utterances to a formal representation and vice-versa, a concept learner that induces generalized concepts for plans based on limited interactions with the user, and an HTN planner that solves the task based on human interaction. We illustrate the ability of this framework to address the key challenges of collaborative problem solving by demonstrating it on a collaborative building task in a Minecraft-based blocksworld domain.

**Abstract:** Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has provided a new paradigm for learning visual representations using large-scale image-text pairs. It shows impressive performance on downstream tasks by zero-shot knowledge transfer. To further enhance CLIP's adaption capability, existing methods proposed to fine-tune additional learnable modules, which significantly improves the few-shot performance but introduces extra training time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose a training-free adaption method for CLIP to conduct few-shot classification, termed as Tip-Adapter, which not only inherits the training-free advantage of zero-shot CLIP but also performs comparably to those training-required approaches. Tip-Adapter constructs the adapter via a key-value cache model from the few-shot training set, and updates the prior knowledge encoded in CLIP by feature retrieval. On top of that, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted to be state-of-the-art on ImageNet by fine-tuning the cache model for 10$\times$ fewer epochs than existing methods, which is both effective and efficient. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on 11 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. Code is released at https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter.

**Abstract:** Communication systems to date primarily aim at reliably communicating bit sequences. Such an approach provides efficient engineering designs that are agnostic to the meanings of the messages or to the goal that the message exchange aims to achieve. Next generation systems, however, can be potentially enriched by folding message semantics and goals of communication into their design. Further, these systems can be made cognizant of the context in which communication exchange takes place, providing avenues for novel design insights. This tutorial summarizes the efforts to date, starting from its early adaptations, semantic-aware and task-oriented communications, covering the foundations, algorithms and potential implementations. The focus is on approaches that utilize information theory to provide the foundations, as well as the significant role of learning in semantics and task-aware communications.

**Abstract:** For many tasks, state-of-the-art results have been achieved with Transformer-based architectures, resulting in a paradigmatic shift in practices from the use of task-specific architectures to the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. The ongoing trend consists in training models with an ever-increasing amount of data and parameters, which requires considerable resources. It leads to a strong search to improve resource efficiency based on algorithmic and hardware improvements evaluated only for English. This raises questions about their usability when applied to small-scale learning problems, for which a limited amount of training data is available, especially for under-resourced languages tasks. The lack of appropriately sized corpora is a hindrance to applying data-driven and transfer learning-based approaches with strong instability cases. In this paper, we establish a state-of-the-art of the efforts dedicated to the usability of Transformer-based models and propose to evaluate these improvements on the question-answering performances of French language which have few resources. We address the instability relating to data scarcity by investigating various training strategies with data augmentation, hyperparameters optimization and cross-lingual transfer. We also introduce a new compact model for French FrALBERT which proves to be competitive in low-resource settings.

**Abstract:** We present VoloGAN, an adversarial domain adaptation network that translates synthetic RGB-D images of a high-quality 3D model of a person, into RGB-D images that could be generated with a consumer depth sensor. This system is especially useful to generate high amount training data for single-view 3D reconstruction algorithms replicating the real-world capture conditions, being able to imitate the style of different sensor types, for the same high-end 3D model database. The network uses a CycleGAN framework with a U-Net architecture for the generator and a discriminator inspired by SIV-GAN. We use different optimizers and learning rate schedules to train the generator and the discriminator. We further construct a loss function that considers image channels individually and, among other metrics, evaluates the structural similarity. We demonstrate that CycleGANs can be used to apply adversarial domain adaptation of synthetic 3D data to train a volumetric video generator model having only few training samples.

**Abstract:** Vision-language navigation is the task of directing an embodied agent to navigate in 3D scenes with natural language instructions. For the agent, inferring the long-term navigation target from visual-linguistic clues is crucial for reliable path planning, which, however, has rarely been studied before in literature. In this article, we propose a Target-Driven Structured Transformer Planner (TD-STP) for long-horizon goal-guided and room layout-aware navigation. Specifically, we devise an Imaginary Scene Tokenization mechanism for explicit estimation of the long-term target (even located in unexplored environments). In addition, we design a Structured Transformer Planner which elegantly incorporates the explored room layout into a neural attention architecture for structured and global planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our TD-STP substantially improves previous best methods' success rate by 2% and 5% on the test set of R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/YushengZhao/TD-STP .

**Abstract:** Over-parameterized models, typically pre-trained language models (LMs), have shown an appealing expressive power due to their small learning bias. However, the huge learning capacity of LMs can also lead to large learning variance. In a pilot study, we find that, when faced with multiple domains, a critical portion of parameters behave unexpectedly in a domain-specific manner while others behave in a domain-general one. Motivated by this phenomenon, we for the first time posit that domain-general parameters can underpin a domain-general LM that can be derived from the original LM. To uncover the domain-general LM, we propose to identify domain-general parameters by playing lottery tickets (dubbed doge tickets). In order to intervene the lottery, we propose a domain-general score, which depicts how domain-invariant a parameter is by associating it with the variance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the Amazon, Mnli and OntoNotes datasets. The results show that the doge tickets obtains an improved out-of-domain generalization in comparison with a range of competitive baselines. Analysis results further hint the existence of domain-general parameters and the performance consistency of doge tickets.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential for training generally capable agents that can interact autonomously in the real world. However, one key limitation is the brittleness of RL algorithms to core hyperparameters and network architecture choice. Furthermore, non-stationarities such as evolving training data and increased agent complexity mean that different hyperparameters and architectures may be optimal at different points of training. This motivates AutoRL, a class of methods seeking to automate these design choices. One prominent class of AutoRL methods is Population-Based Training (PBT), which have led to impressive performance in several large scale settings. In this paper, we introduce two new innovations in PBT-style methods. First, we employ trust-region based Bayesian Optimization, enabling full coverage of the high-dimensional mixed hyperparameter search space. Second, we show that using a generational approach, we can also learn both architectures and hyperparameters jointly on-the-fly in a single training run. Leveraging the new highly parallelizable Brax physics engine, we show that these innovations lead to large performance gains, significantly outperforming the tuned baseline while learning entire configurations on the fly.

<p>

**Abstract:** Building AI models with trustworthiness is important especially in regulated areas such as healthcare. In tackling COVID-19, previous work uses convolutional neural networks as the backbone architecture, which has shown to be prone to over-caution and overconfidence in making decisions, rendering them less trustworthy -- a crucial flaw in the context of medical imaging. In this study, we propose a feature learning approach using Vision Transformers, which use an attention-based mechanism, and examine the representation learning capability of Transformers as a new backbone architecture for medical imaging. Through the task of classifying COVID-19 chest radiographs, we investigate into whether generalization capabilities benefit solely from Vision Transformers' architectural advances. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are conducted on the trustworthiness of the models, through the use of "trust score" computation and a visual explainability technique. We conclude that the attention-based feature learning approach is promising in building trustworthy deep learning models for healthcare.

**Abstract:** Augmented Reality or AR filters on selfies have become very popular on social media platforms for a variety of applications, including marketing, entertainment and aesthetics. Given the wide adoption of AR face filters and the importance of faces in our social structures and relations, there is increased interest by the scientific community to analyze the impact of such filters from a psychological, artistic and sociological perspective. However, there are few quantitative analyses in this area mainly due to a lack of publicly available datasets of facial images with applied AR filters. The proprietary, close nature of most social media platforms does not allow users, scientists and practitioners to access the code and the details of the available AR face filters. Scraping faces from these platforms to collect data is ethically unacceptable and should, therefore, be avoided in research. In this paper, we present OpenFilter, a flexible framework to apply AR filters available in social media platforms on existing large collections of human faces. Moreover, we share FairBeauty and B-LFW, two beautified versions of the publicly available FairFace and LFW datasets and we outline insights derived from the analysis of these beautified datasets.

<p>

**Abstract:** The superior performance of some of today's state-of-the-art deep learning models is to some extent owed to extensive (self-)supervised contrastive pretraining on large-scale datasets. In contrastive learning, the network is presented with pairs of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) datapoints and is trained to find an embedding vector for each datapoint, i.e., a representation, which can be further fine-tuned for various downstream tasks. In order to safely deploy these models in critical decision-making systems, it is crucial to equip them with a measure of their uncertainty or reliability. However, due to the pairwise nature of training a contrastive model, and the lack of absolute labels on the output (an abstract embedding vector), adapting conventional uncertainty estimation techniques to such models is non-trivial. In this work, we study whether the uncertainty of such a representation can be quantified for a single datapoint in a meaningful way. In other words, we explore if the downstream performance on a given datapoint is predictable, directly from its pre-trained embedding. We show that this goal can be achieved by directly estimating the distribution of the training data in the embedding space and accounting for the local consistency of the representations. Our experiments show that this notion of uncertainty for an embedding vector often strongly correlates with its downstream accuracy.

**Abstract:** We propose Neural Deformable Fields (NDF), a new representation for dynamic human digitization from a multi-view video. Recent works proposed to represent a dynamic human body with shared canonical neural radiance fields which links to the observation space with deformation fields estimations. However, the learned canonical representation is static and the current design of the deformation fields is not able to represent large movements or detailed geometry changes. In this paper, we propose to learn a neural deformable field wrapped around a fitted parametric body model to represent the dynamic human. The NDF is spatially aligned by the underlying reference surface. A neural network is then learned to map pose to the dynamics of NDF. The proposed NDF representation can synthesize the digitized performer with novel views and novel poses with a detailed and reasonable dynamic appearance. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

**Abstract:** Domestic service robots that support daily tasks are a promising solution for elderly or disabled people. It is crucial for domestic service robots to explain the collision risk before they perform actions. In this paper, our aim is to generate a caption about a future event. We propose the Relational Future Captioning Model (RFCM), a crossmodal language generation model for the future captioning task. The RFCM has the Relational Self-Attention Encoder to extract the relationships between events more effectively than the conventional self-attention in transformers. We conducted comparison experiments, and the results show the RFCM outperforms a baseline method on two datasets.

**Abstract:** 3D shape matching is a long-standing problem in computer vision and computer graphics. While deep neural networks were shown to lead to state-of-the-art results in shape matching, existing learning-based approaches are limited in the context of multi-shape matching: (i) either they focus on matching pairs of shapes only and thus suffer from cycle-inconsistent multi-matchings, or (ii) they require an explicit template shape to address the matching of a collection of shapes. In this paper, we present a novel approach for deep multi-shape matching that ensures cycle-consistent multi-matchings while not depending on an explicit template shape. To this end, we utilise a shape-to-universe multi-matching representation that we combine with powerful functional map regularisation, so that our multi-shape matching neural network can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner. While the functional map regularisation is only considered during training time, functional maps are not computed for predicting correspondences, thereby allowing for fast inference. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets, and, most remarkably, that our unsupervised method even outperforms recent supervised methods.

**Abstract:** One of the goals of learning algorithms is to complement and reduce the burden on human decision makers. The expert deferral setting wherein an algorithm can either predict on its own or defer the decision to a downstream expert helps accomplish this goal. A fundamental aspect of this setting is the need to learn complementary predictors that improve on the human's weaknesses rather than learning predictors optimized for average error. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis of the benefit of learning complementary predictors in expert deferral. To enable efficiently learning such predictors, we consider a family of consistent surrogate loss functions for expert deferral and analyze their theoretical properties. Finally, we design active learning schemes that require minimal amount of data of human expert predictions in order to learn accurate deferral systems.

**Abstract:** Designing and generating new data under targeted properties has been attracting various critical applications such as molecule design, image editing and speech synthesis. Traditional hand-crafted approaches heavily rely on expertise experience and intensive human efforts, yet still suffer from the insufficiency of scientific knowledge and low throughput to support effective and efficient data generation. Recently, the advancement of deep learning induces expressive methods that can learn the underlying representation and properties of data. Such capability provides new opportunities in figuring out the mutual relationship between the structural patterns and functional properties of the data and leveraging such relationship to generate structural data given the desired properties. This article provides a systematic review of this promising research area, commonly known as controllable deep data generation. Firstly, the potential challenges are raised and preliminaries are provided. Then the controllable deep data generation is formally defined, a taxonomy on various techniques is proposed and the evaluation metrics in this specific domain are summarized. After that, exciting applications of controllable deep data generation are introduced and existing works are experimentally analyzed and compared. Finally, the promising future directions of controllable deep data generation are highlighted and five potential challenges are identified.

**Abstract:** The goal of this survey is to present an explanatory review of the approximation properties of deep neural networks. Specifically, we aim at understanding how and why deep neural networks outperform other classical linear and nonlinear approximation methods. This survey consists of three chapters. In Chapter 1 we review the key ideas and concepts underlying deep networks and their compositional nonlinear structure. We formalize the neural network problem by formulating it as an optimization problem when solving regression and classification problems. We briefly discuss the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and the back-propagation formulas used in solving the optimization problem and address a few issues related to the performance of neural networks, including the choice of activation functions, cost functions, overfitting issues, and regularization. In Chapter 2 we shift our focus to the approximation theory of neural networks. We start with an introduction to the concept of density in polynomial approximation and in particular study the Stone-Weierstrass theorem for real-valued continuous functions. Then, within the framework of linear approximation, we review a few classical results on the density and convergence rate of feedforward networks, followed by more recent developments on the complexity of deep networks in approximating Sobolev functions. In Chapter 3, utilizing nonlinear approximation theory, we further elaborate on the power of depth and approximation superiority of deep ReLU networks over other classical methods of nonlinear approximation.

**Abstract:** With an increasing emphasis on driving down the costs of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) in the Offshore Wind (OSW) sector, comes the requirement to explore new methodology and applications of Deep Learning (DL) to the domain. Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has been at the forefront of recent research developing alarm-based systems and data-driven decision making. This paper provides a brief insight into the research being conducted in this area, with a specific focus on alarm sequence modelling and the associated challenges faced in its implementation. The paper proposes a novel idea to predict a set of relevant repair actions from an input sequence of alarm sequences, comparing Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) models. Achieving training accuracy results of up to 80.23%, and test accuracy results of up to 76.01% with biLSTM gives a strong indication to the potential benefits of the proposed approach that can be furthered in future research. The paper introduces a framework that integrates the proposed approach into O$\&$M procedures and discusses the potential benefits which include the reduction of a confusing plethora of alarms, as well as unnecessary vessel transfers to the turbines for fault diagnosis and correction.

**Abstract:** In a typical optimization problem, the task is to pick one of a number of options with the lowest cost or the highest value. In practice, these cost/value quantities often come through processes such as measurement or machine learning, which are noisy, with quantifiable noise distributions. To take these noise distributions into account, one approach is to assume a prior for the values, use it to build a posterior, and then apply standard stochastic optimization to pick a solution. However, in many practical applications, such prior distributions may not be available. In this paper, we study such scenarios using a regret minimization model.
  In our model, the task is to pick the highest one out of $n$ values. The values are unknown and chosen by an adversary, but can be observed through noisy channels, where additive noises are stochastically drawn from known distributions. The goal is to minimize the regret of our selection, defined as the expected difference between the highest and the selected value on the worst-case choices of values. We show that the na√Øve algorithm of picking the highest observed value has regret arbitrarily worse than the optimum, even when $n = 2$ and the noises are unbiased in expectation. On the other hand, we propose an algorithm which gives a constant-approximation to the optimal regret for any $n$. Our algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and requires only minimal knowledge of the noise distributions.

Furthermore, its adaptable architecture can be used as an add-on module for existing unsupervised algorithms in federated settings. Experiments show that our model improves performance significantly (1.58--5.52pp) on five unsupervised algorithms.

**Abstract:** Most machine learning models for audio tasks are dealing with a handcrafted feature, the spectrogram. However, it is still unknown whether the spectrogram could be replaced with deep learning based features. In this paper, we answer this question by comparing the different learnable neural networks extracting features with a successful spectrogram model and proposed a General Audio Feature eXtractor (GAFX) based on a dual U-Net (GAFX-U), ResNet (GAFX-R), and Attention (GAFX-A) modules. We design experiments to evaluate this model on the music genre classification task on the GTZAN dataset and perform a detailed ablation study of different configurations of our framework and our model GAFX-U, following the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) classifier achieves competitive performance.

**Abstract:** Incremental Task learning (ITL) is a category of continual learning that seeks to train a single network for multiple tasks (one after another), where training data for each task is only available during the training of that task. Neural networks tend to forget older tasks when they are trained for the newer tasks; this property is often known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, ITL methods use episodic memory, parameter regularization, masking and pruning, or extensible network structures. In this paper, we propose a new incremental task learning framework based on low-rank factorization. In particular, we represent the network weights for each layer as a linear combination of several rank-1 matrices. To update the network for a new task, we learn a rank-1 (or low-rank) matrix and add that to the weights of every layer. We also introduce an additional selector vector that assigns different weights to the low-rank matrices learned for the previous tasks. We show that our approach performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and forgetting. Our method also offers better memory efficiency compared to episodic memory- and mask-based approaches. Our code will be available at https://github.com/CSIPlab/task-increment-rank-update.git

**Abstract:** Dataset Condensation is a newly emerging technique aiming at learning a tiny dataset that captures the rich information encoded in the original dataset. As the size of datasets contemporary machine learning models rely on becomes increasingly large, condensation methods become a prominent direction for accelerating network training and reducing data storage. Despite numerous methods have been proposed in this rapidly growing field, evaluating and comparing different condensation methods is non-trivial and still remains an open issue. The quality of condensed dataset are often shadowed by many critical contributing factors to the end performance, such as data augmentation and model architectures. The lack of a systematic way to evaluate and compare condensation methods not only hinders our understanding of existing techniques, but also discourages practical usage of the synthesized datasets. This work provides the first large-scale standardized benchmark on Dataset Condensation. It consists of a suite of evaluations to comprehensively reflect the generability and effectiveness of condensation methods through the lens of their generated dataset. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current condensation methods, and report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development. The benchmark library, including evaluators, baseline methods, and generated datasets, is open-sourced to facilitate future research and application.

**Abstract:** Robust reinforcement learning (RL) considers the problem of learning policies that perform well in the worst case among a set of possible environment parameter values. In real-world environments, choosing the set of possible values for robust RL can be a difficult task. When that set is specified too narrowly, the agent will be left vulnerable to reasonable parameter values unaccounted for. When specified too broadly, the agent will be too cautious. In this paper, we propose Feasible Adversarial Robust RL (FARR), a method for automatically determining the set of environment parameter values over which to be robust. FARR implicitly defines the set of feasible parameter values as those on which an agent could achieve a benchmark reward given enough training resources. By formulating this problem as a two-player zero-sum game, FARR jointly learns an adversarial distribution over parameter values with feasible support and a policy robust over this feasible parameter set. Using the PSRO algorithm to find an approximate Nash equilibrium in this FARR game, we show that an agent trained with FARR is more robust to feasible adversarial parameter selection than with existing minimax, domain-randomization, and regret objectives in a parameterized gridworld and three MuJoCo control environments.

<p>

**Abstract:** Variational autoencoders (VAEs) suffer from posterior collapse, where the powerful neural networks used for modeling and inference optimize the objective without meaningfully using the latent representation. We introduce inference critics that detect and incentivize against posterior collapse by requiring correspondence between latent variables and the observations. By connecting the critic's objective to the literature in self-supervised contrastive representation learning, we show both theoretically and empirically that optimizing inference critics increases the mutual information between observations and latents, mitigating posterior collapse. This approach is straightforward to implement and requires significantly less training time than prior methods, yet obtains competitive results on three established datasets. Overall, the approach lays the foundation to bridge the previously disconnected frameworks of contrastive learning and probabilistic modeling with variational autoencoders, underscoring the benefits both communities may find at their intersection.

**Abstract:** We present ShapeCrafter, a neural network for recursive text-conditioned 3D shape generation. Existing methods to generate text-conditioned 3D shapes consume an entire text prompt to generate a 3D shape in a single step. However, humans tend to describe shapes recursively-we may start with an initial description and progressively add details based on intermediate results. To capture this recursive process, we introduce a method to generate a 3D shape distribution, conditioned on an initial phrase, that gradually evolves as more phrases are added. Since existing datasets are insufficient for training this approach, we present Text2Shape++, a large dataset of 369K shape-text pairs that supports recursive shape generation. To capture local details that are often used to refine shape descriptions, we build on top of vector-quantized deep implicit functions that generate a distribution of high-quality shapes. Results show that our method can generate shapes consistent with text descriptions, and shapes evolve gradually as more phrases are added. Our method supports shape editing, extrapolation, and can enable new applications in human-machine collaboration for creative design.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning aims at training a global model from multiple decentralized devices (i.e. clients) without exchanging their private local data. A key challenge is the handling of non-i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) data across multiple clients that may induce disparities of their local features. We introduce the Hyperspherical Federated Learning (SphereFed) framework to address the non-i.i.d. issue by constraining learned representations of data points to be on a unit hypersphere shared by clients. Specifically, all clients learn their local representations by minimizing the loss with respect to a fixed classifier whose weights span the unit hypersphere. After federated training in improving the global model, this classifier is further calibrated with a closed-form solution by minimizing a mean squared loss. We show that the calibration solution can be computed efficiently and distributedly without direct access of local data. Extensive experiments indicate that our SphereFed approach is able to improve the accuracy of multiple existing federated learning algorithms by a considerable margin (up to 6% on challenging datasets) with enhanced computation and communication efficiency across datasets and model architectures.

**Abstract:** Instance segmentation with unseen objects is a challenging problem in unstructured environments. To solve this problem, we propose a robot learning approach to actively interact with novel objects and collect each object's training label for further fine-tuning to improve the segmentation model performance, while avoiding the time-consuming process of manually labeling a dataset. The Singulation-and-Grasping (SaG) policy is trained through end-to-end reinforcement learning. Given a cluttered pile of objects, our approach chooses pushing and grasping motions to break the clutter and conducts object-agnostic grasping for which the SaG policy takes as input the visual observations and imperfect segmentation. We decompose the problem into three subtasks: (1) the object singulation subtask aims to separate the objects from each other, which creates more space that alleviates the difficulty of (2) the collision-free grasping subtask; (3) the mask generation subtask to obtain the self-labeled ground truth masks by using an optical flow-based binary classifier and motion cue post-processing for transfer learning. Our system achieves 70% singulation success rate in simulated cluttered scenes. The interactive segmentation of our system achieves 87.8%, 73.9%, and 69.3% average precision for toy blocks, YCB objects in simulation and real-world novel objects, respectively, which outperforms several baselines.

**Abstract:** Sparsely Mixture of Experts (MoE) has received great interest due to its promising scaling capability with affordable computational overhead. MoE converts dense layers into sparse experts, and utilizes a gated routing network to make experts conditionally activated. However, as the number of experts grows, MoE with outrageous parameters suffers from overfitting and sparse data allocation. Such problems are especially severe on tasks with limited data, thus hindering the progress for MoE models to improve performance by scaling up. In this work, we propose Mixture of Expert Clusters - a general approach to enable expert layers to learn more diverse and appropriate knowledge by imposing variance-based constraints on the routing stage. We further propose a cluster-level expert dropout strategy specifically designed for the expert cluster structure. Our experiments reveal that MoEC could improve performance on machine translation and natural language understanding tasks, and raise the performance upper bound for scaling up experts under limited data. We also verify that MoEC plays a positive role in mitigating overfitting and sparse data allocation.

**Abstract:** Automatic segmentation of multiple organs and tumors from 3D medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans using deep learning methods can aid in diagnosing and treating cancer. However, organs often overlap and are complexly connected, characterized by extensive anatomical variation and low contrast. In addition, the diversity of tumor shape, location, and appearance, coupled with the dominance of background voxels, makes accurate 3D medical image segmentation difficult. In this paper, a novel large-kernel (LK) attention module is proposed to address these problems to achieve accurate multi-organ segmentation and tumor segmentation. The advantages of convolution and self-attention are combined in the proposed LK attention module, including local contextual information, long-range dependence, and channel adaptation. The module also decomposes the LK convolution to optimize the computational cost and can be easily incorporated into FCNs such as U-Net. Comprehensive ablation experiments demonstrated the feasibility of convolutional decomposition and explored the most efficient and effective network design. Among them, the best Mid-type LK attention-based U-Net network was evaluated on CT-ORG and BraTS 2020 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance. The performance improvement due to the proposed LK attention module was also statistically validated.

**Abstract:** Closed-loop architecture is widely utilized in automatic control systems and attain distinguished performance. However, classical compressive sensing systems employ open-loop architecture with separated sampling and reconstruction units. Therefore, a method of iterative compensation recovery for image compressive sensing (ICRICS) is proposed by introducing closed-loop framework into traditional compresses sensing systems. The proposed method depends on any existing approaches and upgrades their reconstruction performance by adding negative feedback structure. Theory analysis on negative feedback of compressive sensing systems is performed. An approximate mathematical proof of the effectiveness of the proposed method is also provided. Simulation experiments on more than 3 image datasets show that the proposed method is superior to 10 competition approaches in reconstruction performance. The maximum increment of average peak signal-to-noise ratio is 4.36 dB and the maximum increment of average structural similarity is 0.034 on one dataset. The proposed method based on negative feedback mechanism can efficiently correct the recovery error in the existing systems of image compressive sensing.

**Abstract:** Monitoring of prevalent airborne diseases such as COVID-19 characteristically involve respiratory assessments. While auscultation is a mainstream method for symptomatic monitoring, its diagnostic utility is hampered by the need for dedicated hospital visits. Continual remote monitoring based on recordings of respiratory sounds on portable devices is a promising alternative, which can assist in screening of COVID-19. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning approach to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from healthy controls given audio recordings of cough or breathing sounds. The proposed approach leverages a novel hierarchical spectrogram transformer (HST) on spectrogram representations of respiratory sounds. HST embodies self-attention mechanisms over local windows in spectrograms, and window size is progressively grown over model stages to capture local to global context. HST is compared against state-of-the-art conventional and deep-learning baselines. Comprehensive demonstrations on a multi-national dataset indicate that HST outperforms competing methods, achieving over 97% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in detecting COVID-19 cases.

**Abstract:** Albeit the Dice loss is one of the dominant loss functions in medical image segmentation, most research omits a closer look at its derivative, i.e. the real motor of the optimization when using gradient descent. In this paper, we highlight the peculiar action of the Dice loss in the presence of missing or empty labels. First, we formulate a theoretical basis that gives a general description of the Dice loss and its derivative. It turns out that the choice of the reduction dimensions $Œ¶$ and the smoothing term $Œµ$ is non-trivial and greatly influences its behavior. We find and propose heuristic combinations of $Œ¶$ and $Œµ$ that work in a segmentation setting with either missing or empty labels. Second, we empirically validate these findings in a binary and multiclass segmentation setting using two publicly available datasets. We confirm that the choice of $Œ¶$ and $Œµ$ is indeed pivotal. With $Œ¶$ chosen such that the reductions happen over a single batch (and class) element and with a negligible $Œµ$, the Dice loss deals with missing labels naturally and performs similarly compared to recent adaptations specific for missing labels. With $Œ¶$ chosen such that the reductions happen over multiple batch elements or with a heuristic value for $Œµ$, the Dice loss handles empty labels correctly. We believe that this work highlights some essential perspectives and hope that it encourages researchers to better describe their exact implementation of the Dice loss in future work.

**Abstract:** Estimating the Generalization Error (GE) of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is an important task that often relies on availability of held-out data. The ability to better predict GE based on a single training set may yield overarching DNN design principles to reduce a reliance on trial-and-error, along with other performance assessment advantages. In search of a quantity relevant to GE, we investigate the Mutual Information (MI) between the input and final layer representations, using the infinite-width DNN limit to bound MI. An existing input compression-based GE bound is used to link MI and GE. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first empirical study of this bound. In our attempt to empirically falsify the theoretical bound, we find that it is often tight for best-performing models. Furthermore, it detects randomization of training labels in many cases, reflects test-time perturbation robustness, and works well given only few training samples. These results are promising given that input compression is broadly applicable where MI can be estimated with confidence.

**Abstract:** In transfer learning, only the last part of the networks - the so-called head - is often fine-tuned. Representation similarity analysis shows that the most significant change still occurs in the head even if all weights are updatable. However, recent results from few-shot learning have shown that representation change in the early layers, which are mostly convolutional, is beneficial, especially in the case of cross-domain adaption. In our paper, we find out whether that also holds true for transfer learning. In addition, we analyze the change of representation in transfer learning, both during pre-training and fine-tuning, and find out that pre-trained structure is unlearned if not usable.

**Abstract:** As a pivotal component to attaining generalizable solutions in human intelligence, reasoning provides great potential for reinforcement learning (RL) agents' generalization towards varied goals by summarizing part-to-whole arguments and discovering cause-and-effect relations. However, how to discover and represent causalities remains a huge gap that hinders the development of causal RL. In this paper, we augment Goal-Conditioned RL (GCRL) with Causal Graph (CG), a structure built upon the relation between objects and events. We novelly formulate the GCRL problem into variational likelihood maximization with CG as latent variables. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventional data to estimate the posterior of CG; using CG to learn generalizable models and interpretable policies. Due to the lack of public benchmarks that verify generalization capability under reasoning, we design nine tasks and then empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed method against five baselines on these tasks. Further theoretical analysis shows that our performance improvement is attributed to the virtuous cycle of causal discovery, transition modeling, and policy training, which aligns with the experimental evidence in extensive ablation studies.

**Abstract:** Collaborative Filtering(CF) recommender is a crucial application in the online market and ecommerce. However, CF recommender has been proven to suffer from persistent problems related to sparsity of the user rating that will further lead to a cold-start issue. Existing methods address the data sparsity issue by applying token-level sentiment analysis that translate text review into sentiment scores as a complement of the user rating. In this paper, we attempt to optimize the sentiment analysis with advanced NLP models including BERT and RoBERTa, and experiment on whether the CF recommender has been further enhanced. We build the recommenders on the Amazon US Reviews dataset, and tune the pretrained BERT and RoBERTa with the traditional fine-tuned paradigm as well as the new prompt-based learning paradigm. Experimental result shows that the recommender enhanced with the sentiment ratings predicted by the fine-tuned RoBERTa has the best performance, and achieved 30.7% overall gain by comparing MAP, NDCG and precision at K to the baseline recommender. Prompt-based learning paradigm, although superior to traditional fine-tune paradigm in pure sentiment analysis, fail to further improve the CF recommender.

**Abstract:** Deep learning has seen tremendous interest in medical imaging, particularly in the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for developing automated diagnostic tools. The facility of its non-invasive acquisition makes retinal fundus imaging amenable to such automated approaches. Recent work in analyzing fundus images using CNNs relies on access to massive data for training and validation - hundreds of thousands of images. However, data residency and data privacy restrictions stymie the applicability of this approach in medical settings where patient confidentiality is a mandate. Here, we showcase results for the performance of DL on small datasets to classify patient sex from fundus images - a trait thought not to be present or quantifiable in fundus images until recently. We fine-tune a Resnet-152 model whose last layer has been modified for binary classification. In several experiments, we assess performance in the small dataset context using one private (DOVS) and one public (ODIR) data source. Our models, developed using approximately 2500 fundus images, achieved test AUC scores of up to 0.72 (95% CI: [0.67, 0.77]). This corresponds to a mere 25% decrease in performance despite a nearly 1000-fold decrease in the dataset size compared to prior work in the literature. Even with a hard task like sex categorization from retinal images, we find that classification is possible with very small datasets. Additionally, we perform domain adaptation experiments between DOVS and ODIR; explore the effect of data curation on training and generalizability; and investigate model ensembling to maximize CNN classifier performance in the context of small development datasets.

**Abstract:** Image classification with deep neural networks has seen a surge of technological breakthroughs with promising applications in areas such as face recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous driving. In engineering problems, however, such as high-speed imaging of engine fuel injector sprays or body paint sprays, deep neural networks face a fundamental challenge related to the availability of adequate and diverse data. Typically, only thousands or sometimes even hundreds of samples are available for training. In addition, the transition between different spray classes is a continuum and requires a high level of domain expertise to label the images accurately. In this work, we used Mixup as an approach to systematically deal with the data scarcity and ambiguous class boundaries found in industrial spray applications. We show that data augmentation can mitigate the over-fitting problem of large neural networks on small data sets, to a certain level, but cannot fundamentally resolve the issue. We discuss how a convex linear interpolation of different classes naturally aligns with the continuous transition between different classes in our application. Our experiments demonstrate Mixup as a simple yet effective method to train an accurate and robust deep neural network classifier with only a few hundred samples.

**Abstract:** Prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is growing alarmingly every year leading to a substantial increase in the mortality rate. Endoscopic detection is providing crucial diagnostic support, however, subtle lesions in upper and lower GI are quite hard to detect and cause considerable missed detection. In this work, we leverage deep learning to develop a framework to improve the localization of difficult to detect lesions and minimize the missed detection rate. We propose an end to end student-teacher learning setup where class probabilities of a trained teacher model on one class with larger dataset are used to penalize multi-class student network. Our model achieves higher performance in terms of mean average precision (mAP) on both endoscopic disease detection (EDD2020) challenge and Kvasir-SEG datasets. Additionally, we show that using such learning paradigm, our model is generalizable to unseen test set giving higher APs for clinically crucial neoplastic and polyp categories

**Abstract:** Prostate cancer is the second-most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in males worldwide. The main problem that specialists face during the diagnosis of prostate cancer is the localization of Regions of Interest (ROI) containing a tumor tissue. Currently, the segmentation of this ROI in most cases is carried out manually by expert doctors, but the procedure is plagued with low detection rates (of about 27-44%) or overdiagnosis in some patients. Therefore, several research works have tackled the challenge of automatically segmenting and extracting features of the ROI from magnetic resonance images, as this process can greatly facilitate many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, the lack of clear prostate boundaries, the heterogeneity inherent to the prostate tissue, and the variety of prostate shapes makes this process very difficult to automate.In this work, six deep learning models were trained and analyzed with a dataset of MRI images obtained from the Centre Hospitalaire de Dijon and Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. We carried out a comparison of multiple deep learning models (i.e. U-Net, Attention U-Net, Dense-UNet, Attention Dense-UNet, R2U-Net, and Attention R2U-Net) using categorical cross-entropy loss function. The analysis was performed using three metrics commonly used for image segmentation: Dice score, Jaccard index, and mean squared error. The model that give us the best result segmenting all the zones was R2U-Net, which achieved 0.869, 0.782, and 0.00013 for Dice, Jaccard and mean squared error, respectively.

**Abstract:** In a desired environmental protection system, groundwater may not be excluded. In addition to the problem of over-exploitation, in total disagreement with the concept of sustainable development, another not negligible issue concerns the groundwater contamination. Mainly, this aspect is due to intensive agricultural activities or industrialized areas. In literature, several papers have dealt with transport problem, especially for inverse problems in which the release history or the source location are identified. The innovative aim of the paper is to develop a data-driven model that is able to analyze multiple scenarios, even strongly non-linear, in order to solve forward and inverse transport problems, preserving the reliability of the results and reducing the uncertainty. Furthermore, this tool has the characteristic of providing extremely fast responses, essential to identify remediation strategies immediately. The advantages produced by the model were compared with literature studies. In this regard, a feedforward artificial neural network, which has been trained to handle different cases, represents the data-driven model. Firstly, to identify the concentration of the pollutant at specific observation points in the study area (forward problem); secondly, to deal with inverse problems identifying the release history at known source location; then, in case of one contaminant source, identifying the release history and, at the same time, the location of the source in a specific sub-domain of the investigated area. At last, the observation error is investigated and estimated. The results are satisfactorily achieved, highlighting the capability of the ANN to deal with multiple scenarios by approximating nonlinear functions without the physical point of view that describes the phenomenon, providing reliable results, with very low computational burden and uncertainty.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning optimization showed that, with some a-posteriori information on fully-trained models, it is possible to match the same performance by simply training a subset of their parameters. Such a discovery has a broad impact from theory to applications, driving the research towards methods to identify the minimum subset of parameters to train without look-ahead information exploitation. However, the methods proposed do not match the state-of-the-art performance, and rely on unstructured sparsely connected models. In this work we shift our focus from the single parameters to the behavior of the whole neuron, exploiting the concept of neuronal equilibrium (NEq). When a neuron is in a configuration at equilibrium (meaning that it has learned a specific input-output relationship), we can halt its update; on the contrary, when a neuron is at non-equilibrium, we let its state evolve towards an equilibrium state, updating its parameters. The proposed approach has been tested on different state-of-the-art learning strategies and tasks, validating NEq and observing that the neuronal equilibrium depends on the specific learning setup.

**Abstract:** The group synchronization problem involves estimating a collection of group elements from noisy measurements of their pairwise ratios. This task is a key component in many computational problems, including the molecular reconstruction problem in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The standard methods to estimate the group elements are based on iteratively applying linear and non-linear operators. Motivated by the structural similarity to deep neural networks, we adopt the concept of algorithm unrolling, where training data is used to optimize the algorithm. We design unrolled algorithms for several group synchronization instances, including synchronization over the group of 3-D rotations: the synchronization problem in cryo-EM. We also apply a similar approach to the multi-reference alignment problem. We show by numerical experiments that the unrolling strategy outperforms existing synchronization algorithms in a wide variety of scenarios.

**Abstract:** We propose a greedy algorithm to select $N$ important features among $P$ input features for a non-linear prediction problem. The features are selected one by one sequentially, in an iterative loss minimization procedure. We use neural networks as predictors in the algorithm to compute the loss and hence, we refer to our method as neural greedy pursuit (NGP). NGP is efficient in selecting $N$ features when $N \ll P$, and it provides a notion of feature importance in a descending order following the sequential selection procedure. We experimentally show that NGP provides better performance than several feature selection methods such as DeepLIFT and Drop-one-out loss. In addition, we experimentally show a phase transition behavior in which perfect selection of all $N$ features without false positives is possible when the training data size exceeds a threshold.

**Abstract:** Lung nodule detection in chest X-ray (CXR) images is common to early screening of lung cancers. Deep-learning-based Computer-Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) systems can support radiologists for nodule screening in CXR. However, it requires large-scale and diverse medical data with high-quality annotations to train such robust and accurate CADs. To alleviate the limited availability of such datasets, lung nodule synthesis methods are proposed for the sake of data augmentation. Nevertheless, previous methods lack the ability to generate nodules that are realistic with the size attribute desired by the detector. To address this issue, we introduce a novel lung nodule synthesis framework in this paper, which decomposes nodule attributes into three main aspects including shape, size, and texture, respectively. A GAN-based Shape Generator firstly models nodule shapes by generating diverse shape masks. The following Size Modulation then enables quantitative control on the diameters of the generated nodule shapes in pixel-level granularity. A coarse-to-fine gated convolutional Texture Generator finally synthesizes visually plausible nodule textures conditioned on the modulated shape masks. Moreover, we propose to synthesize nodule CXR images by controlling the disentangled nodule attributes for data augmentation, in order to better compensate for the nodules that are easily missed in the detection task. Our experiments demonstrate the enhanced image quality, diversity, and controllability of the proposed lung nodule synthesis framework. We also validate the effectiveness of our data augmentation on greatly improving nodule detection performance.

**Abstract:** In Bora et al. (2017), a mathematical framework was developed for compressed sensing guarantees in the setting where the measurement matrix is Gaussian and the signal structure is the range of a generative neural network (GNN). The problem of compressed sensing with GNNs has since been extensively analyzed when the measurement matrix and/or network weights follow a subgaussian distribution. We move beyond the subgaussian assumption, to measurement matrices that are derived by sampling uniformly at random rows of a unitary matrix (including subsampled Fourier measurements as a special case). Specifically, we prove the first known restricted isometry guarantee for generative compressed sensing with subsampled isometries, and provide recovery bounds with nearly order-optimal sample complexity, addressing an open problem of Scarlett et al. (2022, p. 10). Recovery efficacy is characterized by the coherence, a new parameter, which measures the interplay between the range of the network and the measurement matrix. Our approach relies on subspace counting arguments and ideas central to high-dimensional probability. Furthermore, we propose a regularization strategy for training GNNs to have favourable coherence with the measurement operator. We provide compelling numerical simulations that support this regularized training strategy: our strategy yields low coherence networks that require fewer measurements for signal recovery. This, together with our theoretical results, supports coherence as a natural quantity for characterizing generative compressed sensing with subsampled isometries.

**Abstract:** We establish a sharp uniform-in-time error estimate for the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), which is a popular sampling algorithm. Under mild assumptions, we obtain a uniform-in-time $O(Œ∑^2)$ bound for the KL-divergence between the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, where $Œ∑$ is the step size (or learning rate). Our analysis is also valid for varying step sizes. Based on this, we are able to obtain an $O(Œ∑)$ bound for the distance between the SGLD iteration and the invariant distribution of the Langevin diffusion, in terms of Wasserstein or total variation distances.

**Abstract:** Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been popular in many disciplines including robotics, state-of-the-art DRL algorithms still struggle to learn long-horizon, multi-step and sparse reward tasks, such as stacking several blocks given only a task-completion reward signal. To improve learning efficiency for such tasks, this paper proposes a DRL exploration technique, termed A^2, which integrates two components inspired by human experiences: Abstract demonstrations and Adaptive exploration. A^2 starts by decomposing a complex task into subtasks, and then provides the correct orders of subtasks to learn. During training, the agent explores the environment adaptively, acting more deterministically for well-mastered subtasks and more stochastically for ill-learnt subtasks. Ablation and comparative experiments are conducted on several grid-world tasks and three robotic manipulation tasks. We demonstrate that A^2 can aid popular DRL algorithms (DQN, DDPG, and SAC) to learn more efficiently and stably in these environments.

**Abstract:** In the last five years, the rise of the self-attentional Transformer-based architectures led to state-of-the-art performances over many natural language tasks. Although these approaches are increasingly popular, they require large amounts of data and computational resources. There is still a substantial need for benchmarking methodologies ever upwards on under-resourced languages in data-scarce application conditions. Most pre-trained language models were massively studied using the English language and only a few of them were evaluated on French. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, focused on evaluating models quality and their ecological impact on two well-known French spoken language understanding tasks. Especially we benchmark thirteen well-established Transformer-based models on the two available spoken language understanding tasks for French: MEDIA and ATIS-FR. Within this framework, we show that compact models can reach comparable results to bigger ones while their ecological impact is considerably lower. However, this assumption is nuanced and depends on the considered compression method.

**Abstract:** A new method for estimating the conditional average treatment effect is proposed in the paper. It is called TNW-CATE (the Trainable Nadaraya-Watson regression for CATE) and based on the assumption that the number of controls is rather large whereas the number of treatments is small. TNW-CATE uses the Nadaraya-Watson regression for predicting outcomes of patients from the control and treatment groups. The main idea behind TNW-CATE is to train kernels of the Nadaraya-Watson regression by using a weight sharing neural network of a specific form. The network is trained on controls, and it replaces standard kernels with a set of neural subnetworks with shared parameters such that every subnetwork implements the trainable kernel, but the whole network implements the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. The network memorizes how the feature vectors are located in the feature space. The proposed approach is similar to the transfer learning when domains of source and target data are similar, but tasks are different. Various numerical simulation experiments illustrate TNW-CATE and compare it with the well-known T-learner, S-learner and X-learner for several types of the control and treatment outcome functions. The code of proposed algorithms implementing TNW-CATE is available in https://github.com/Stasychbr/TNW-CATE.

**Abstract:** Manipulation of biomedical images to misrepresent experimental results has plagued the biomedical community for a while. Recent interest in the problem led to the curation of a dataset and associated tasks to promote the development of biomedical forensic methods. Of these, the largest manipulation detection task focuses on the detection of duplicated regions between images. Traditional computer-vision based forensic models trained on natural images are not designed to overcome the challenges presented by biomedical images. We propose a multi-scale overlap detection model to detect duplicated image regions. Our model is structured to find duplication hierarchically, so as to reduce the number of patch operations. It achieves state-of-the-art performance overall and on multiple biomedical image categories.

**Abstract:** We present improved algorithms and matching statistical and computational lower bounds for the problem of identity testing $n$-dimensional distributions. In the identity testing problem, we are given as input an explicit distribution $Œº$, an $\varepsilon>0$, and access to a sampling oracle for a hidden distribution $œÄ$. The goal is to distinguish whether the two distributions $Œº$ and $œÄ$ are identical or are at least $\varepsilon$-far apart. When there is only access to full samples from the hidden distribution $œÄ$, it is known that exponentially many samples may be needed, and hence previous works have studied identity testing with additional access to various conditional sampling oracles. We consider here a significantly weaker conditional sampling oracle, called the Coordinate Oracle, and provide a fairly complete computational and statistical characterization of the identity testing problem in this new model.
  We prove that if an analytic property known as approximate tensorization of entropy holds for the visible distribution $Œº$, then there is an efficient identity testing algorithm for any hidden $œÄ$ that uses $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)$ queries to the Coordinate Oracle. Approximate tensorization of entropy is a classical tool for proving optimal mixing time bounds of Markov chains for high-dimensional distributions, and recently has been established for many families of distributions via spectral independence. We complement our algorithmic result for identity testing with a matching $Œ©(n/\varepsilon)$ statistical lower bound for the number of queries under the Coordinate Oracle. We also prove a computational phase transition: for sparse antiferromagnetic Ising models over $\{+1,-1\}^n$, in the regime where approximate tensorization of entropy fails, there is no efficient identity testing algorithm unless RP=NP.

**Abstract:** Modern language models leverage increasingly large numbers of parameters to achieve performance on natural language understanding tasks. Ensembling these models in specific configurations for downstream tasks show even further performance improvements. In this paper, we perform an analysis of bagging language models and compare single language models to bagged ensembles that are roughly equivalent in terms of final model size. We explore an array of model bagging configurations for natural language understanding tasks with final ensemble sizes ranging from 300M parameters to 1.5B parameters and determine that our ensembling methods are at best roughly equivalent to single LM baselines. We note other positive effects of bagging and pruning in specific scenarios according to findings in our experiments such as variance reduction and minor performance improvements.

**Abstract:** As opaque predictive models increasingly impact many areas of modern life, interest in quantifying the importance of a given input variable for making a specific prediction has grown. Recently, there has been a proliferation of model-agnostic methods to measure variable importance (VI) that analyze the difference in predictive power between a full model trained on all variables and a reduced model that excludes the variable(s) of interest. A bottleneck common to these methods is the estimation of the reduced model for each variable (or subset of variables), which is an expensive process that often does not come with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose a fast and flexible method for approximating the reduced model with important inferential guarantees. We replace the need for fully retraining a wide neural network by a linearization initialized at the full model parameters. By adding a ridge-like penalty to make the problem convex, we prove that when the ridge penalty parameter is sufficiently large, our method estimates the variable importance measure with an error rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ where $n$ is the number of training samples. We also show that our estimator is asymptotically normal, enabling us to provide confidence bounds for the VI estimates. We demonstrate through simulations that our method is fast and accurate under several data-generating regimes, and we demonstrate its real-world applicability on a seasonal climate forecasting example.

**Abstract:** As the importance of intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) increases, great costs are incurred to manage the signatures that are generated by malicious communication pattern files. Experts in network security need to classify signatures by importance for an IDPS to work. We propose and evaluate a machine learning signature classification model with a reject option (RO) to reduce the cost of setting up an IDPS. To train the proposed model, it is essential to design features that are effective for signature classification. Experts classify signatures with predefined if-then rules. An if-then rule returns a label of low, medium, high, or unknown importance based on keyword matching of the elements in the signature. Therefore, we first design two types of features, symbolic features (SFs) and keyword features (KFs), which are used in keyword matching for the if-then rules. Next, we design web information and message features (WMFs) to capture the properties of signatures that do not match the if-then rules. The WMFs are extracted as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) features of the message text in the signatures. The features are obtained by web scraping from the referenced external attack identification systems described in the signature. Because failure needs to be minimized in the classification of IDPS signatures, as in the medical field, we consider introducing a RO in our proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed classification model is evaluated in experiments with two real datasets composed of signatures labeled by experts: a dataset that can be classified with if-then rules and a dataset with elements that do not match an if-then rule. In the experiment, the proposed model is evaluated. In both cases, the combined SFs and WMFs performed better than the combined SFs and KFs. In addition, we also performed feature analysis.

This paper provides a multi-phase Deep Learning-based system that hybridizes various efficient methods in order to get the best 3D segmentation output. First, to reduce the amount of data and accelerate the processing time, the application of Decimate compression technique is suggested and justified. We then use a CNN model to segment dental images into fifteen separated classes. In the end, a special KNN-based transformation is applied for the purpose of removing isolated meshes and of correcting dental forms. Experimentations demonstrate the precision and the robustness of the selected framework applied to 3D dental images within a private clinical benchmark.

**Abstract:** The design of data-driven formulations for machine learning and decision-making with good out-of-sample performance is a key challenge. The observation that good in-sample performance does not guarantee good out-of-sample performance is generally known as overfitting. Practical overfitting can typically not be attributed to a single cause but instead is caused by several factors all at once. We consider here three overfitting sources: (i) statistical error as a result of working with finite sample data, (ii) data noise which occurs when the data points are measured only with finite precision, and finally (iii) data misspecification in which a small fraction of all data may be wholly corrupted. We argue that although existing data-driven formulations may be robust against one of these three sources in isolation they do not provide holistic protection against all overfitting sources simultaneously. We design a novel data-driven formulation which does guarantee such holistic protection and is furthermore computationally viable. Our distributionally robust optimization formulation can be interpreted as a novel combination of a Kullback-Leibler and Levy-Prokhorov robust optimization formulation. Finally, we show how in the context of classification and regression problems several popular regularized and robust formulations reduce to a particular case of our proposed more general formulation.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) allows for collaboratively aggregating learned information across several computing devices and sharing the same amongst them, thereby tackling issues of privacy and the need of huge bandwidth. FL techniques generally use a central server or cloud for aggregating the models received from the devices. Such centralized FL techniques suffer from inherent problems such as failure of the central node and bottlenecks in channel bandwidth. When FL is used in conjunction with connected robots serving as devices, a failure of the central controlling entity can lead to a chaotic situation. This paper describes a mobile agent based paradigm to decentralize FL in multi-robot scenarios. Using Webots, a popular free open-source robot simulator, and Tartarus, a mobile agent platform, we present a methodology to decentralize federated learning in a set of connected robots. With Webots running on different connected computing systems, we show how mobile agents can perform the task of Decentralized Federated Reinforcement Learning (dFRL). Results obtained from experiments carried out using Q-learning and SARSA by aggregating their corresponding Q-tables, show the viability of using decentralized FL in the domain of robotics. Since the proposed work can be used in conjunction with other learning algorithms and also real robots, it can act as a vital tool for the study of decentralized FL using heterogeneous learning algorithms concurrently in multi-robot scenarios.

**Abstract:** In this work, we consider the task of improving the accuracy of dynamic models for model predictive control (MPC) in an online setting. Even though prediction models can be learned and applied to model-based controllers, these models are often learned offline. In this offline setting, training data is first collected and a prediction model is learned through an elaborated training procedure. After the model is trained to a desired accuracy, it is then deployed in a model predictive controller. However, since the model is learned offline, it does not adapt to disturbances or model errors observed during deployment. To improve the adaptiveness of the model and the controller, we propose an online dynamics learning framework that continually improves the accuracy of the dynamic model during deployment. We adopt knowledge-based neural ordinary differential equations (KNODE) as the dynamic models, and use techniques inspired by transfer learning to continually improve the model accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework with a quadrotor robot, and verify the framework in both simulations and physical experiments. Results show that the proposed approach is able to account for disturbances that are possibly time-varying, while maintaining good trajectory tracking performance.

**Abstract:** Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a common approach to learning predictive models using not only labeled examples, but also unlabeled examples. While SSL for the simple tasks of classification and regression has received a lot of attention from the research community, this is not properly investigated for complex prediction tasks with structurally dependent variables. This is the case of multi-label classification and hierarchical multi-label classification tasks, which may require additional information, possibly coming from the underlying distribution in the descriptive space provided by unlabeled examples, to better face the challenging task of predicting simultaneously multiple class labels.
  In this paper, we investigate this aspect and propose a (hierarchical) multi-label classification method based on semi-supervised learning of predictive clustering trees. We also extend the method towards ensemble learning and propose a method based on the random forest approach. Extensive experimental evaluation conducted on 23 datasets shows significant advantages of the proposed method and its extension with respect to their supervised counterparts. Moreover, the method preserves interpretability and reduces the time complexity of classical tree-based models.

**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, in which malicious clients corrupt the global model via sending manipulated model updates to the server. Existing defenses mainly rely on Byzantine-robust FL methods, which aim to learn an accurate global model even if some clients are malicious. However, they can only resist a small number of malicious clients in practice. It is still an open challenge how to defend against model poisoning attacks with a large number of malicious clients. Our FLDetector addresses this challenge via detecting malicious clients. FLDetector aims to detect and remove the majority of the malicious clients such that a Byzantine-robust FL method can learn an accurate global model using the remaining clients. Our key observation is that, in model poisoning attacks, the model updates from a client in multiple iterations are inconsistent. Therefore, FLDetector detects malicious clients via checking their model-updates consistency. Roughly speaking, the server predicts a client's model update in each iteration based on its historical model updates using the Cauchy mean value theorem and L-BFGS, and flags a client as malicious if the received model update from the client and the predicted model update are inconsistent in multiple iterations. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that FLDetector can accurately detect malicious clients in multiple state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks. After removing the detected malicious clients, existing Byzantine-robust FL methods can learn accurate global models.Our code is available at https://github.com/zaixizhang/FLDetector.

**Abstract:** Real-world databases are complex, they usually present redundancy and shared correlations between heterogeneous and multiple representations of the same data. Thus, exploiting and disentangling shared information between views is critical. For this purpose, recent studies often fuse all views into a shared nonlinear complex latent space but they lose the interpretability. To overcome this limitation, here we propose a novel method to combine multiple Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) architectures with a Factor Analysis latent space (FA-VAE). Concretely, we use a VAE to learn a private representation of each heterogeneous view in a continuous latent space. Then, we model the shared latent space by projecting every private variable to a low-dimensional latent space using a linear projection matrix. Thus, we create an interpretable hierarchical dependency between private and shared information. This way, the novel model is able to simultaneously: (i) learn from multiple heterogeneous views, (ii) obtain an interpretable hierarchical shared space, and, (iii) perform transfer learning between generative models.

**Abstract:** We consider an improper reinforcement learning setting where a learner is given $M$ base controllers for an unknown Markov decision process, and wishes to combine them optimally to produce a potentially new controller that can outperform each of the base ones. This can be useful in tuning across controllers, learnt possibly in mismatched or simulated environments, to obtain a good controller for a given target environment with relatively few trials.
  Towards this, we propose two algorithms: (1) a Policy Gradient-based approach; and (2) an algorithm that can switch between a simple Actor-Critic (AC) based scheme and a Natural Actor-Critic (NAC) scheme depending on the available information. Both algorithms operate over a class of improper mixtures of the given controllers. For the first case, we derive convergence rate guarantees assuming access to a gradient oracle. For the AC-based approach we provide convergence rate guarantees to a stationary point in the basic AC case and to a global optimum in the NAC case. Numerical results on (i) the standard control theoretic benchmark of stabilizing an cartpole; and (ii) a constrained queueing task show that our improper policy optimization algorithm can stabilize the system even when the base policies at its disposal are unstable.

**Abstract:** We consider vertical logistic regression (VLR) trained with mini-batch gradient descent -- a setting which has attracted growing interest among industries and proven to be useful in a wide range of applications including finance and medical research. We provide a comprehensive and rigorous privacy analysis of VLR in a class of open-source Federated Learning frameworks, where the protocols might differ between one another, yet a procedure of obtaining local gradients is implicitly shared. We first consider the honest-but-curious threat model, in which the detailed implementation of protocol is neglected and only the shared procedure is assumed, which we abstract as an oracle. We find that even under this general setting, single-dimension feature and label can still be recovered from the other party under suitable constraints of batch size, thus demonstrating the potential vulnerability of all frameworks following the same philosophy. Then we look into a popular instantiation of the protocol based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE). We propose an active attack that significantly weaken the constraints on batch size in the previous analysis via generating and compressing auxiliary ciphertext. To address the privacy leakage within the HE-based protocol, we develop a simple-yet-effective countermeasure based on Differential Privacy (DP), and provide both utility and privacy guarantees for the updated algorithm. Finally, we empirically verify the effectiveness of our attack and defense on benchmark datasets. Altogether, our findings suggest that all vertical federated learning frameworks that solely depend on HE might contain severe privacy risks, and DP, which has already demonstrated its power in horizontal federated learning, can also play a crucial role in the vertical setting, especially when coupled with HE or secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques.

**Abstract:** Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) aims to learn a policy solving a set of training tasks simultaneously and quickly adapting to new tasks. It requires massive amounts of data drawn from training tasks to infer the common structure shared among tasks. Without heavy reward engineering, the sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks exacerbate the problem of sample efficiency in meta-RL. Another challenge in meta-RL is the discrepancy of difficulty level among tasks, which might cause one easy task dominating learning of the shared policy and thus preclude policy adaptation to new tasks. This work introduces a novel objective function to learn an action translator among training tasks. We theoretically verify that the value of the transferred policy with the action translator can be close to the value of the source policy and our objective function (approximately) upper bounds the value difference. We propose to combine the action translator with context-based meta-RL algorithms for better data collection and more efficient exploration during meta-training. Our approach empirically improves the sample efficiency and performance of meta-RL algorithms on sparse-reward tasks.

**Abstract:** With the growing burden of training deep learning models with large data sets, transfer-learning has been widely adopted in many emerging deep learning algorithms. Transformer models such as BERT are the main player in natural language processing and use transfer-learning as a de facto standard training method. A few big data companies release pre-trained models that are trained with a few popular datasets with which end users and researchers fine-tune the model with their own datasets. Transfer-learning significantly reduces the time and effort of training models. However, it comes at the cost of security concerns. In this paper, we show a new observation that pre-trained models and fine-tuned models have significantly high similarities in weight values. Also, we demonstrate that there exist vendor-specific computing patterns even for the same models. With these new findings, we propose a new model extraction attack that reveals the model architecture and the pre-trained model used by the black-box victim model with vendor-specific computing patterns and then estimates the entire model weights based on the weight value similarities between the fine-tuned model and pre-trained model. We also show that the weight similarity can be leveraged for increasing the model extraction feasibility through a novel weight extraction pruning.

**Abstract:** One of the brightest objects in the universe, supernovae (SNe) are powerful explosions marking the end of a star's lifetime. Supernova (SN) type is defined by spectroscopic emission lines, but obtaining spectroscopy is often logistically unfeasible. Thus, the ability to identify SNe by type using time-series image data alone is crucial, especially in light of the increasing breadth and depth of upcoming telescopes. We present a convolutional neural network method for fast supernova time-series classification, with observed brightness data smoothed in both the wavelength and time directions with Gaussian process regression. We apply this method to full duration and truncated SN time-series, to simulate retrospective as well as real-time classification performance. Retrospective classification is used to differentiate cosmologically useful Type Ia SNe from other SN types, and this method achieves >99% accuracy on this task. We are also able to differentiate between 6 SN types with 60% accuracy given only two nights of data and 98% accuracy retrospectively.

**Abstract:** This work considers optimization of composition of functions in a nested form over Riemannian manifolds where each function contains an expectation. This type of problems is gaining popularity in applications such as policy evaluation in reinforcement learning or model customization in meta-learning. The standard Riemannian stochastic gradient methods for non-compositional optimization cannot be directly applied as stochastic approximation of inner functions create bias in the gradients of the outer functions. For two-level composition optimization, we present a Riemannian Stochastic Composition Gradient Descent (R-SCGD) method that finds an approximate stationary point, with expected squared Riemannian gradient smaller than $Œµ$, in $O(Œµ^{-2})$ calls to the stochastic gradient oracle of the outer function and stochastic function and gradient oracles of the inner function. Furthermore, we generalize the R-SCGD algorithms for problems with multi-level nested compositional structures, with the same complexity of $O(Œµ^{-2})$ for the first-order stochastic oracle. Finally, the performance of the R-SCGD method is numerically evaluated over a policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:** Enhancing existing transmission lines is a useful tool to combat transmission congestion and guarantee transmission security with increasing demand and boosting the renewable energy source. This study concerns the selection of lines whose capacity should be expanded and by how much from the perspective of independent system operator (ISO) to minimize the system cost with the consideration of transmission line constraints and electricity generation and demand balance conditions, and incorporating ramp-up and startup ramp rates, shutdown ramp rates, ramp-down rate limits and minimum up and minimum down times. For that purpose, we develop the ISO unit commitment and economic dispatch model and show it as a right-hand side uncertainty multiple parametric analysis for the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. We first relax the binary variable to continuous variables and employ the Lagrange method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to obtain optimal solutions (optimal decision variables and objective function) and critical regions associated with active and inactive constraints. Further, we extend the traditional branch and bound method for the large-scale MILP problem by determining the upper bound of the problem at each node, then comparing the difference between the upper and lower bounds and reaching the approximate optimal solution within the decision makers' tolerated error range. In additional, the objective function's first derivative on the parameters of each line is used to inform the selection of lines to ease congestion and maximize social welfare. Finally, the amount of capacity upgrade will be chosen by balancing the cost-reduction rate of the objective function on parameters and the cost of the line upgrade. Our findings are supported by numerical simulation and provide transmission line planners with decision-making guidance.

**Abstract:** Distributed file systems are widely used nowadays, yet using their default configurations is often not optimal. At the same time, tuning configuration parameters is typically challenging and time-consuming. It demands expertise and tuning operations can also be expensive. This is especially the case for static parameters, where changes take effect only after a restart of the system or workloads. We propose a novel approach, Magpie, which utilizes deep reinforcement learning to tune static parameters by strategically exploring and exploiting configuration parameter spaces. To boost the tuning of the static parameters, our method employs both server and client metrics of distributed file systems to understand the relationship between static parameters and performance. Our empirical evaluation results show that Magpie can noticeably improve the performance of the distributed file system Lustre, where our approach on average achieves 91.8% throughput gains against default configuration after tuning towards single performance indicator optimization, while it reaches 39.7% more throughput gains against the baseline.

**Abstract:** A permanently increasing number of on-board automotive control systems requires new approaches to their digital mapping that improves functionality in terms of adaptability and robustness as well as enables their easier on-line software update. As it can be concluded from many recent studies, various methods applying neural networks (NN) can be good candidates for relevant digital twin (DT) tools in automotive control system design, for example, for controller parameterization and condition monitoring. However, the NN-based DT has strong requirements to an adequate amount of data to be used in training and design. In this regard, the paper presents an approach, which demonstrates how the regression tasks can be efficiently handled by the modeling of a semi-active shock absorber within the DT framework. The approach is based on the adaptation of time series augmentation techniques to the stationary data that increases the variance of the latter. Such a solution gives a background to elaborate further data engineering methods for the data preparation of sophisticated databases.

**Abstract:** The deployment of the sensor nodes (SNs) always plays a decisive role in the system performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this work, we propose an optimal deployment method for practical heterogeneous WSNs which gives a deep insight into the trade-off between the reliability and deployment cost. Specifically, this work aims to provide the optimal deployment of SNs to maximize the coverage degree and connection degree, and meanwhile minimize the overall deployment cost. In addition, this work fully considers the heterogeneity of SNs (i.e. differentiated sensing range and deployment cost) and three-dimensional (3-D) deployment scenarios. This is a multi-objective optimization problem, non-convex, multimodal and NP-hard. To solve it, we develop a novel swarm-based multi-objective optimization algorithm, known as the competitive multi-objective marine predators algorithm (CMOMPA) whose performance is verified by comprehensive comparative experiments with ten other stateof-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms. The computational results demonstrate that CMOMPA is superior to others in terms of convergence and accuracy and shows excellent performance on multimodal multiobjective optimization problems. Sufficient simulations are also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the CMOMPA based optimal SNs deployment method. The results show that the optimized deployment can balance the trade-off among deployment cost, sensing reliability and network reliability.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we proposed XG-BoT, an explainable deep graph neural network model for botnet node detection. The proposed model is mainly composed of a botnet detector and an explainer for automatic forensics. The XG-BoT detector can effectively detect malicious botnet nodes under large-scale networks. Specifically, it utilizes a grouped reversible residual connection with a graph isomorphism network to learn expressive node representations from the botnet communication graphs. The explainer in XG-BoT can perform automatic network forensics by highlighting suspicious network flows and related botnet nodes. We evaluated XG-BoT on real-world, large-scale botnet network graphs. Overall, XG-BoT is able to outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of evaluation metrics. In addition, we show that the XG-BoT explainer can generate useful explanations based on GNNExplainer for automatic network forensics.

**Abstract:** Incremental learning is one paradigm to enable model building and updating at scale with streaming data. For end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, the absence of human annotated labels along with the need for privacy preserving policies for model building makes it a daunting challenge. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper we use a cloud based framework for production systems to demonstrate insights from privacy preserving incremental learning for automatic speech recognition (ILASR). By privacy preserving, we mean, usage of ephemeral data which are not human annotated. This system is a step forward for production levelASR models for incremental/continual learning that offers near real-time test-bed for experimentation in the cloud for end-to-end ASR, while adhering to privacy-preserving policies. We show that the proposed system can improve the production models significantly(3%) over a new time period of six months even in the absence of human annotated labels with varying levels of weak supervision and large batch sizes in incremental learning. This improvement is 20% over test sets with new words and phrases in the new time period. We demonstrate the effectiveness of model building in a privacy-preserving incremental fashion for ASR while further exploring the utility of having an effective teacher model and use of large batch sizes.

**Abstract:** Layout Analysis (the identification of zones and their classification) is the first step along line segmentation in Optical Character Recognition and similar tasks. The ability of identifying main body of text from marginal text or running titles makes the difference between extracting the work full text of a digitized book and noisy outputs. We show that most segmenters focus on pixel classification and that polygonization of this output has not been used as a target for the latest competition on historical document (ICDAR 2017 and onwards), despite being the focus in the early 2010s. We propose to shift, for efficiency, the task from a pixel classification-based polygonization to an object detection using isothetic rectangles. We compare the output of Kraken and YOLOv5 in terms of segmentation and show that the later severely outperforms the first on small datasets (1110 samples and below). We release two datasets for training and evaluation on historical documents as well as a new package, YALTAi, which injects YOLOv5 in the segmentation pipeline of Kraken 4.1.

**Abstract:** Due to the ever-growing demands for electronic chips in different sectors the semiconductor companies have been mandated to offshore their manufacturing processes. This unwanted matter has made security and trustworthiness of their fabricated chips concerning and caused creation of hardware attacks. In this condition, different entities in the semiconductor supply chain can act maliciously and execute an attack on the design computing layers, from devices to systems. Our attack is a hardware Trojan that is inserted during mask generation/fabrication in an untrusted foundry. The Trojan leaves a footprint in the fabricated through addition, deletion, or change of design cells. In order to tackle this problem, we propose Explainable Vision System for Hardware Testing and Assurance (EVHA) in this work that can detect the smallest possible change to a design in a low-cost, accurate, and fast manner. The inputs to this system are Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images acquired from the Integrated Circuits (ICs) under examination. The system output is determination of IC status in terms of having any defect and/or hardware Trojan through addition, deletion, or change in the design cells at the cell-level.

**Abstract:** This paper is our attempt at answering a twofold question covering the areas of ethics and authorship analysis. Firstly, since the methods used for performing authorship analysis imply that an author can be recognized by the content he or she creates, we were interested in finding out whether it would be possible for an author identification system to correctly attribute works to authors if in the course of years they have undergone a major psychological transition. Secondly, and from the point of view of the evolution of an author's ethical values, we checked what it would mean if the authorship attribution system encounters difficulties in detecting single authorship. We set out to answer those questions through performing a binary authorship analysis task using a text classifier based on a pre-trained transformer model and a baseline method relying on conventional similarity metrics. For the test set, we chose works of Arata Osada, a Japanese educator and specialist in the history of education, with half of them being books written before the World War II and another half in the 1950s, in between which he underwent a transformation in terms of political opinions. As a result, we were able to confirm that in the case of texts authored by Arata Osada in a time span of more than 10 years, while the classification accuracy drops by a large margin and is substantially lower than for texts by other non-fiction writers, confidence scores of the predictions remain at a similar level as in the case of a shorter time span, indicating that the classifier was in many instances tricked into deciding that texts written over a time span of multiple years were actually written by two different people, which in turn leads us to believe that such a change can affect authorship analysis, and that historical events have great impact on a person's ethical outlook as expressed in their writings.
