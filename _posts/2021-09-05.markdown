**Abstract:** This paper demonstrates that by fine-tuning an autoregressive language model (GPT-Neo) on appropriately structured step-by-step demonstrations, it is possible to teach it to execute a mathematical task that has previously proved difficult for Transformers - longhand modulo operations - with a relatively small number of examples. Specifically, we fine-tune GPT-Neo to solve the numbers__div_remainder task from the DeepMind Mathematics Dataset; Saxton et al. (arXiv:1904.01557) reported below 40% accuracy on this task with 2 million training examples. We show that after fine-tuning on 200 appropriately structured demonstrations of solving long division problems and reporting the remainders, the smallest available GPT-Neo model achieves over 80% accuracy. This is achieved by constructing an appropriate dataset for fine-tuning, with no changes to the learning algorithm. These results suggest that fine-tuning autoregressive language models on small sets of well-crafted demonstrations may be a useful paradigm for enabling individuals without training in machine learning to coax such models to perform some kinds of complex multi-step tasks.

**Abstract:** Masked language modeling (MLM) is one of the key sub-tasks in vision-language pretraining. In the cross-modal setting, tokens in the sentence are masked at random, and the model predicts the masked tokens given the image and the text. In this paper, we observe several key disadvantages of MLM in this setting. First, as captions tend to be short, in a third of the sentences no token is sampled. Second, the majority of masked tokens are stop-words and punctuation, leading to under-utilization of the image. We investigate a range of alternative masking strategies specific to the cross-modal setting that address these shortcomings, aiming for better fusion of text and image in the learned representation. When pre-training the LXMERT model, our alternative masking strategies consistently improve over the original masking strategy on three downstream tasks, especially in low resource settings. Further, our pre-training approach substantially outperforms the baseline model on a prompt-based probing task designed to elicit image objects. These results and our analysis indicate that our method allows for better utilization of the training data.

**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse conditional computation has been proved an effective architecture for scaling attention-based models to more parameters with comparable computation cost. In this paper, we propose Sparse-MLP, scaling the recent MLP-Mixer model with sparse MoE layers, to achieve a more computation-efficient architecture. We replace a subset of dense MLP blocks in the MLP-Mixer model with Sparse blocks. In each Sparse block, we apply two stages of MoE layers: one with MLP experts mixing information within channels along image patch dimension, one with MLP experts mixing information within patches along the channel dimension. Besides, to reduce computational cost in routing and improve expert capacity, we design Re-represent layers in each Sparse block. These layers are to re-scale image representations by two simple but effective linear transformations. When pre-training on ImageNet-1k with MoCo v3 algorithm, our models can outperform dense MLP models by 2.5\% on ImageNet Top-1 accuracy with fewer parameters and computational cost. On small-scale downstream image classification tasks, i.e. Cifar10 and Cifar100, our Sparse-MLP can still achieve better performance than baselines.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks attempt to disrupt the training, retraining and utilizing of artificial intelligence and machine learning models in large-scale distributed machine learning systems. This causes security risks on its prediction outcome. For example, attackers attempt to poison the model by either presenting inaccurate misrepresentative data or altering the models' parameters. In addition, Byzantine faults including software, hardware, network issues occur in distributed systems which also lead to a negative impact on the prediction outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed training algorithm, partial synchronous stochastic gradient descent (ParSGD), which defends adversarial attacks and/or tolerates Byzantine faults. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under three common adversarial attacks again the ML models and a Byzantine fault during the training phase. Our results show that using ParSGD, ML models can still produce accurate predictions as if it is not being attacked nor having failures at all when almost half of the nodes are being compromised or failed. We will report the experimental evaluations of ParSGD in comparison with other algorithms.

**Abstract:** This research project investigates the application of deep learning to timbre transfer, where the timbre of a source audio can be converted to the timbre of a target audio with minimal loss in quality. The adopted approach combines Variational Autoencoders with Generative Adversarial Networks to construct meaningful representations of the source audio and produce realistic generations of the target audio and is applied to the Flickr 8k Audio dataset for transferring the vocal timbre between speakers and the URMP dataset for transferring the musical timbre between instruments. Furthermore, variations of the adopted approach are trained, and generalised performance is compared using the metrics SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) and FAD (Frech√©t Audio Distance). It was found that a many-to-many approach supersedes a one-to-one approach in terms of reconstructive capabilities, and that the adoption of a basic over a bottleneck residual block design is more suitable for enriching content information about a latent space. It was also found that the decision on whether cyclic loss takes on a variational autoencoder or vanilla autoencoder approach does not have a significant impact on reconstructive and adversarial translation aspects of the model.

**Abstract:** The use of mobiles phones when driving have been a major factor when it comes to road traffic incidents and the process of capturing such violations can be a laborious task. Advancements in both modern object detection frameworks and high-performance hardware has paved the way for a more automated approach when it comes to video surveillance. In this work, we propose a custom-trained state-of-the-art object detector to work with roadside cameras to capture driver phone usage without the need for human intervention. The proposed approach also addresses the issues caused by windscreen glare and introduces the steps required to remedy this. Twelve pre-trained models are fine-tuned with our custom dataset using four popular object detection methods: YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet. Out of all the object detectors tested, the YOLO yields the highest accuracy levels of up to 96% (AP10) and frame rates of up to ~30 FPS. DeepSort object tracking algorithm is also integrated into the best-performing model to collect records of only the unique violations, and enable the proposed approach to count the number of vehicles. The proposed automated system will collect the output images of the identified violations, timestamps of each violation, and total vehicle count. Data can be accessed via a purpose-built user interface.

**Abstract:** Distantly supervised relation extraction (RE) automatically aligns unstructured text with relation instances in a knowledge base (KB). Due to the incompleteness of current KBs, sentences implying certain relations may be annotated as N/A instances, which causes the so-called false negative (FN) problem. Current RE methods usually overlook this problem, inducing improper biases in both training and testing procedures. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach. First, it finds out possible FN samples by heuristically leveraging the memory mechanism of deep neural networks. Then, it aligns those unlabeled data with the training data into a unified feature space by adversarial training to assign pseudo labels and further utilize the information contained in them. Experiments on two wildly-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

**Abstract:** Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) are a method for performing symbolic AI on top of real-valued vectors \cite{Plate1995} by associating each vector with an abstract concept, and providing mathematical operations to manipulate vectors as if they were classic symbolic objects. This method has seen little use outside of older symbolic AI work and cognitive science. Our goal is to revisit this approach to understand if it is viable for enabling a hybrid neural-symbolic approach to learning as a differentiable component of a deep learning architecture. HRRs today are not effective in a differentiable solution due to numerical instability, a problem we solve by introducing a projection step that forces the vectors to exist in a well behaved point in space. In doing so we improve the concept retrieval efficacy of HRRs by over $100\times$. Using multi-label classification we demonstrate how to leverage the symbolic HRR properties to develop an output layer and loss function that is able to learn effectively, and allows us to investigate some of the pros and cons of an HRR neuro-symbolic learning approach.

**Abstract:** We describe the Phonexia submission for the VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge 2021 (VoxSRC-21) in the unsupervised speaker verification track. Our solution was very similar to IDLab's winning submission for VoxSRC-20. An embedding extractor was bootstrapped using momentum contrastive learning, with input augmentations as the only source of supervision. This was followed by several iterations of clustering to assign pseudo-speaker labels that were then used for supervised embedding extractor training. Finally, a score fusion was done, by averaging the zt-normalized cosine scores of five different embedding extractors. We briefly also describe unsuccessful solutions involving i-vectors instead of DNN embeddings and PLDA instead of cosine scoring.

**Abstract:** Biomedical entity linking is the task of linking entity mentions in a biomedical document to referent entities in a knowledge base. Recently, many BERT-based models have been introduced for the task. While these models have achieved competitive results on many datasets, they are computationally expensive and contain about 110M parameters. Little is known about the factors contributing to their impressive performance and whether the over-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner working mechanisms of these large BERT-based models. Through a set of probing experiments, we have found that the entity linking performance only changes slightly when the input word order is shuffled or when the attention scope is limited to a fixed window size. From these observations, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network with residual connections for biomedical entity linking. Because of the sparse connectivity and weight sharing properties, our model has a small number of parameters and is highly efficient. On five public datasets, our model achieves comparable or even better linking accuracy than the state-of-the-art BERT-based models while having about 60 times fewer parameters.

**Abstract:** This paper considers joint analysis of multiple functionally related structures in classification tasks. In particular, our method developed is driven by how functionally correlated brain structures vary together between autism and control groups. To do so, we devised a method based on a novel combination of (1) non-Euclidean statistics that can faithfully represent non-Euclidean data in Euclidean spaces and (2) a non-parametric integrative analysis method that can decompose multi-block Euclidean data into joint, individual, and residual structures. We find that the resulting joint structure is effective, robust, and interpretable in recognizing the underlying patterns of the joint variation of multi-block non-Euclidean data. We verified the method in classifying the structural shape data collected from cases that developed and did not develop into Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

**Abstract:** Modern neural networks are powerful predictive models. However, when it comes to recognizing that they may be wrong about their predictions, they perform poorly. For example, for one of the most common activation functions, the ReLU and its variants, even a well-calibrated model can produce incorrect but high confidence predictions. In the related task of action recognition, most current classification methods are based on clip-level classifiers that densely sample a given video for non-overlapping, same-sized clips and aggregate the results using an aggregation function - typically averaging - to achieve video level predictions. While this approach has shown to be effective, it is sub-optimal in recognition accuracy and has a high computational overhead. To mitigate both these issues, we propose the confidence distillation framework to teach a representation of uncertainty of the teacher to the student sampler and divide the task of full video prediction between the student and the teacher models. We conduct extensive experiments on three action recognition datasets and demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in action recognition accuracy (up to 20%) and computational efficiency (more than 40%).

**Abstract:** Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training. This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from scratch.

**Abstract:** In this work we analyze how Gaussian or Newton-Cotes quadrature rules of different precisions and piecewise polynomial test functions of different degrees affect the convergence rate of Variational Physics Informed Neural Networks (VPINN) with respect to mesh refinement, while solving elliptic boundary-value problems. Using a Petrov-Galerkin framework relying on an inf-sup condition, we derive an a priori error estimate in the energy norm between the exact solution and a suitable high-order piecewise interpolant of a computed neural network. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical predictions, and also indicate that the error decay follows the same behavior when the neural network is not interpolated. Our results suggest, somehow counterintuitively, that for smooth solutions the best strategy to achieve a high decay rate of the error consists in choosing test functions of the lowest polynomial degree, while using quadrature formulas of suitably high precision.

**Abstract:** In deep neural networks, better results can often be obtained by increasing the complexity of previously developed basic models. However, it is unclear whether there is a way to boost performance by decreasing the complexity of such models. Here, based on an optimization method, we investigate the feasibility of improving graph classification performance while simplifying the model learning process. Inspired by progress in structural information assessment, we optimize the given data sample from graphs to encoding trees. In particular, we minimize the structural entropy of the transformed encoding tree to decode the key structure underlying a graph. This transformation is denoted as structural optimization. Furthermore, we propose a novel feature combination scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, for encoding trees. In this scheme, features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the hierarchical structures of encoding trees. We then present an implementation of the scheme in a tree kernel and a convolutional network to perform graph classification. The tree kernel follows label propagation in the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree kernel, but it has a lower runtime complexity $O(n)$. The convolutional network is a special implementation of our tree kernel in the deep learning field and is called Encoding Tree Learning (ETL). We empirically validate our tree kernel and convolutional network with several graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that our methods achieve better performance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches.

<p>

**Abstract:** Cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) have shown their promising performance for speech enhancement (SE), while one intractable shortcoming of these CycleGAN-based SE systems is that the noise components propagate throughout the cycle and cannot be completely eliminated. Additionally, conventional CycleGAN-based SE systems only estimate the spectral magnitude, while the phase is unaltered. Motivated by the multi-stage learning concept, we propose a novel two-stage denoising system that combines a CycleGAN-based magnitude enhancing network and a subsequent complex spectral refining network in this paper. Specifically, in the first stage, a CycleGAN-based model is responsible for only estimating magnitude, which is subsequently coupled with the original noisy phase to obtain a coarsely enhanced complex spectrum. After that, the second stage is applied to further suppress the residual noise components and estimate the clean phase by a complex spectral mapping network, which is a pure complex-valued network composed of complex 2D convolution/deconvolution and complex temporal-frequency attention blocks. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently surpasses previous one-stage CycleGANs and other state-of-the-art SE systems in terms of various evaluation metrics, especially in background noise suppression.

**Abstract:** Driven by the need to capture users' evolving interests and optimize their long-term experiences, more and more recommender systems have started to model recommendation as a Markov decision process and employ reinforcement learning to address the problem. Shouldn't research on the fairness of recommender systems follow the same trend from static evaluation and one-shot intervention to dynamic monitoring and non-stop control? In this paper, we portray the recent developments in recommender systems first and then discuss how fairness could be baked into the reinforcement learning techniques for recommendation. Moreover, we argue that in order to make further progress in recommendation fairness, we may want to consider multi-agent (game-theoretic) optimization, multi-objective (Pareto) optimization, and simulation-based optimization, in the general framework of stochastic games.

<p>

**Abstract:** Over the past few years, various word-level textual attack approaches have been proposed to reveal the vulnerability of deep neural networks used in natural language processing. Typically, these approaches involve an important optimization step to determine which substitute to be used for each word in the original input. However, current research on this step is still rather limited, from the perspectives of both problem-understanding and problem-solving. In this paper, we address these issues by uncovering the theoretical properties of the problem and proposing an efficient local search algorithm (LS) to solve it. We establish the first provable approximation guarantee on solving the problem in general cases.Extensive experiments involving 5 NLP tasks, 8 datasets and 26 NLP models show that LS can largely reduce the number of queries usually by an order of magnitude to achieve high attack success rates. Further experiments show that the adversarial examples crafted by LS usually have higher quality, exhibit better transferability, and can bring more robustness improvement to victim models by adversarial training.

**Abstract:** The present study investigates the accurate inference of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions for the compressible flow over aerofoils in two dimensions with a deep neural network. Our approach yields networks that learn to generate precise flow fields for varying body-fitted, structured grids by providing them with an encoding of the corresponding mapping to a canonical space for the solutions. We apply the deep neural network model to a benchmark case of incompressible flow at randomly given angles of attack and Reynolds numbers and achieve an improvement of more than an order of magnitude compared to previous work. Further, for transonic flow cases, the deep neural network model accurately predicts complex flow behaviour at high Reynolds numbers, such as shock wave/boundary layer interaction, and quantitative distributions like pressure coefficient, skin friction coefficient as well as wake total pressure profiles downstream of aerofoils. The proposed deep learning method significantly speeds up the predictions of flow fields and shows promise for enabling fast aerodynamic designs.

**Abstract:** Right ventricular (RV) segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial step for cardiac morphology and function analysis. However, automatic RV segmentation from MRI is still challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneous intensity, the complex variable shapes, and the unclear RV boundary. Moreover, current methods for the RV segmentation tend to suffer from performance degradation at the basal and apical slices of MRI. In this work, we propose an automatic RV segmentation framework, where the information from long-axis (LA) views is utilized to assist the segmentation of short-axis (SA) views via information transition. Specifically, we employed the transformed segmentation from LA views as a prior information, to extract the ROI from SA views for better segmentation. The information transition aims to remove the surrounding ambiguous regions in the SA views. %, such as the tricuspid valve regions. We tested our model on a public dataset with 360 multi-center, multi-vendor and multi-disease subjects that consist of both LA and SA MRIs. Our experimental results show that including LA views can be effective to improve the accuracy of the SA segmentation. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/NanYoMy/MMs-2.

**Abstract:** Segmentation plays a crucial role in diagnosis. Studying the retinal vasculatures from fundus images help identify early signs of many crucial illnesses such as diabetic retinopathy. Due to the varying shape, size, and patterns of retinal vessels, along with artefacts and noises in fundus images, no one-stage method can accurately segment retinal vessels. In this work, we propose a multi-scale, multi-level attention embedded CNN architecture ((M)SLAe-Net) to address the issue of multi-stage processing for robust and precise segmentation of retinal vessels. We do this by extracting features at multiple scales and multiple levels of the network, enabling our model to holistically extracts the local and global features. Multi-scale features are extracted using our novel dynamic dilated pyramid pooling (D-DPP) module. We also aggregate the features from all the network levels. These effectively resolved the issues of varying shapes and artefacts and hence the need for multiple stages. To assist in better pixel-level classification, we use the Squeeze and Attention(SA) module, a smartly adapted version of the Squeeze and Excitation(SE) module for segmentation tasks in our network to facilitate pixel-group attention. Our unique network design and novel D-DPP module with efficient task-specific loss function for thin vessels enabled our model for better cross data performance. Exhaustive experimental results on DRIVE, STARE, HRF, and CHASE-DB1 show the superiority of our method.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a nonparametric approach that can be used in envelope extraction, peak-burst detection and clustering in time series. Our problem formalization results in a naturally defined splitting/forking of the time series. With a possibly hierarchical implementation, it can be used for various applications in machine learning, signal processing and mathematical finance. From an incoming input signal, our iterative procedure sequentially creates two signals (one upper bounding and one lower bounding signal) by minimizing the cumulative $L_1$ drift. We show that a solution can be efficiently calculated by use of a Viterbi-like path tracking algorithm together with an optimal elimination rule. We consider many interesting settings, where our algorithm has near-linear time complexities.

**Abstract:** Community detection, aiming to group the graph nodes into clusters with dense inner-connection, is a fundamental graph mining task. Recently, it has been studied on the heterogeneous graph, which contains multiple types of nodes and edges, posing great challenges for modeling the high-order relationship between nodes. With the surge of graph embedding mechanism, it has also been adopted to community detection. A remarkable group of works use the meta-path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes and embed them into nodes' embedding to facilitate community detection. However, defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose to exploit the context path to capture the high-order relationship between nodes, and build a Context Path-based Graph Neural Network (CP-GNN) model. It recursively embeds the high-order relationship between nodes into the node embedding with attention mechanisms to discriminate the importance of different relationships. By maximizing the expectation of the co-occurrence of nodes connected by context paths, the model can learn the nodes' embeddings that both well preserve the high-order relationship between nodes and are helpful for community detection. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets show that CP-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art community detection methods.

**Abstract:** The shortage of workforce and increasing cost of maintenance has forced many farm industrialists to shift towards automated and mechanized approaches. The key component for autonomous systems is the path planning techniques used. Coverage path planning (CPP) algorithm is used for navigating over farmlands to perform various agricultural operations such as seeding, ploughing, or spraying pesticides and fertilizers. This report paper compares novel algorithms for autonomous navigation of farmlands. For reduction of navigational constraints, a high-resolution grid map representation is taken into consideration specific to Indian environments. The free space is covered by distinguishing the grid cells as covered, unexplored, partially explored and presence of an obstacle. The performance of the compared algorithms is evaluated with metrics such as time efficiency, space efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to changes in the environment. Robotic Operating System (ROS), Dassault Systemes Experience Platform (3DS Experience), MATLAB along Python were used for the simulation of the compared algorithms. The results proved the applicability of the algorithms for autonomous field navigation and feasibility with robotic path planning.

**Abstract:** Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows is computationally expensive and cannot be applied to flows with large Reynolds numbers. Large eddy simulation (LES) is an alternative that is computationally less demanding, but is unable to capture all of the scales of turbulent transport accurately. Our goal in this work is to build a new data-driven methodology based on super-resolution techniques to reconstruct DNS data from LES predictions. We leverage the underlying physical relationships to regularize the relationships amongst different physical variables. We also introduce a hierarchical generative process and a reverse degradation process to fully explore the correspondence between DNS and LES data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a single-snapshot experiment and a cross-time experiment. The results confirm that our method can better reconstruct high-resolution DNS data over space and over time in terms of pixel-wise reconstruction error and structural similarity. Visual comparisons show that our method performs much better in capturing fine-level flow dynamics.

**Abstract:** Most Fairness in AI research focuses on exposing biases in AI systems. A broader lens on fairness reveals that AI can serve a greater aspiration: rooting out societal inequities from their source. Specifically, we focus on inequities in health information, and aim to reduce bias in that domain using AI. The AI algorithms under the hood of search engines and social media, many of which are based on recommender systems, have an outsized impact on the quality of medical and health information online. Therefore, embedding bias detection and reduction into these recommender systems serving up medical and health content online could have an outsized positive impact on patient outcomes and wellbeing.
  In this position paper, we offer the following contributions: (1) we propose a novel framework of Fairness via AI, inspired by insights from medical education, sociology and antiracism; (2) we define a new term, bisinformation, which is related to, but distinct from, misinformation, and encourage researchers to study it; (3) we propose using AI to study, detect and mitigate biased, harmful, and/or false health information that disproportionately hurts minority groups in society; and (4) we suggest several pillars and pose several open problems in order to seed inquiry in this new space. While part (3) of this work specifically focuses on the health domain, the fundamental computer science advances and contributions stemming from research efforts in bias reduction and Fairness via AI have broad implications in all areas of society.

**Abstract:** In this paper, the robot-assisted Reminiscence Therapy (RT) is studied as a psychosocial intervention to persons with dementia (PwDs). We aim at a conversation strategy for the robot by reinforcement learning to stimulate the PwD to talk. Specifically, to characterize the stochastic reactions of a PwD to the robot's actions, a simulation model of a PwD is developed which features the transition probabilities among different PwD states consisting of the response relevance, emotion levels and confusion conditions. A Q-learning (QL) algorithm is then designed to achieve the best conversation strategy for the robot. The objective is to stimulate the PwD to talk as much as possible while keeping the PwD's states as positive as possible. In certain conditions, the achieved strategy gives the PwD choices to continue or change the topic, or stop the conversation, so that the PwD has a sense of control to mitigate the conversation stress. To achieve this, the standard QL algorithm is revised to deliberately integrate the impact of PwD's choices into the Q-value updates. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the learning convergence and validate the efficacy of the achieved strategy. Tests show that the strategy is capable to duly adjust the difficulty level of prompt according to the PwD's states, take actions (e.g., repeat or explain the prompt, or comfort) to help the PwD out of bad states, and allow the PwD to control the conversation tendency when bad states continue.

**Abstract:** Classification has been a major task for building intelligent systems as it enables decision-making under uncertainty. Classifier design aims at building models from training data for representing feature-label distributions--either explicitly or implicitly. In many scientific or clinical settings, training data are typically limited, which makes designing accurate classifiers and evaluating their classification error extremely challenging. While transfer learning (TL) can alleviate this issue by incorporating data from relevant source domains to improve learning in a different target domain, it has received little attention for performance assessment, notably in error estimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating knowledge transferability in the context of classification error estimation within a Bayesian paradigm. We introduce a novel class of Bayesian minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimators for optimal Bayesian transfer learning (OBTL), which enables rigorous evaluation of classification error under uncertainty in a small-sample setting. Using Monte Carlo importance sampling, we employ the proposed estimator to evaluate the classification accuracy of a broad family of classifiers that span diverse learning capabilities. Experimental results based on both synthetic data as well as real-world RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data show that our proposed OBTL error estimation scheme clearly outperforms standard error estimators, especially in a small-sample setting, by tapping into the data from other relevant domains.

**Abstract:** Since this COVID-19 pandemic thrives, the utilization of X-Ray images of the Chest (CXR) as a complementary screening technique to RT-PCR testing grows to its clinical use for respiratory complaints. Many new deep learning approaches have developed as a consequence. The goal of this research is to assess the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to diagnosis COVID-19 utisizing X-ray images of chest. The performance of CNN with one, three, and four convolution layers has been evaluated in this research. A dataset of 13,808 CXR photographs are used in this research. When evaluated on X-ray images with three splits of the dataset, our preliminary experimental results show that the CNN model with three convolution layers can reliably detect with 96 percent accuracy (precision being 96 percent). This fact indicates the commitment of our suggested model for reliable screening of COVID-19.

**Abstract:** One of the goals of every business enterprise is to increase customer loyalty. The degree of customer loyalty is called customer quality which its forecasting will affect strategic marketing practices. The purpose of this study is to predict the quality of customers of large e-commerce social networks by big data algorithms and unsupervised learning. For this purpose, a graph-based social network analysis framework was used for community detection in the Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP). Then in the found communities, the quality of customers was predicted. The results showed that various visits with an impact of 37.13% can have the greatest impact on customer quality and the order of impact of other parameters were from highest to lowest: number of frequent customer visits (28.56%), role in social networks (28.37%), Indirect transactions (26.74%), activity days (25.62%) and customer social network size (25.06%).

**Abstract:** Human activity recognition plays an increasingly important role not only in our daily lives, but also in the medical and rehabilitation fields. The development of deep learning has also contributed to the advancement of human activity recognition, but the large amount of data annotation work required to train deep learning models is a major obstacle to the development of human activity recognition. Contrastive learning has started to be used in the field of sensor-based human activity recognition due to its ability to avoid the cost of labeling large datasets and its ability to better distinguish between sample representations of different instances. Among them, data augmentation, an important part of contrast learning, has a significant impact on model effectiveness, but current data augmentation methods do not perform too successfully in contrast learning frameworks for wearable sensor-based activity recognition. To optimize the effect of contrast learning models, in this paper, we investigate the sampling frequency of sensors and propose a resampling data augmentation method. In addition, we also propose a contrast learning framework based on human activity recognition and apply the resampling augmentation method to the data augmentation phase of contrast learning. The experimental results show that the resampling augmentation method outperforms supervised learning by 9.88% on UCI HAR and 7.69% on Motion Sensor in the fine-tuning evaluation of contrast learning with a small amount of labeled data, and also reveal that not all data augmentation methods will have positive effects in the contrast learning framework. Finally, we explored the influence of the combination of different augmentation methods on contrastive learning, and the experimental results showed that the effect of most combination augmentation methods was better than that of single augmentation.

**Abstract:** To alleviate data sparsity and cold-start problems of traditional recommender systems (RSs), incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement auxiliary information has attracted considerable attention recently. However, simply integrating KGs in current KG-based RS models is not necessarily a guarantee to improve the recommendation performance, which may even weaken the holistic model capability. This is because the construction of these KGs is independent of the collection of historical user-item interactions; hence, information in these KGs may not always be helpful for recommendation to all users.
  In this paper, we propose attentive Knowledge-aware Graph convolutional networks with Collaborative Guidance for personalized Recommendation (CG-KGR). CG-KGR is a novel knowledge-aware recommendation model that enables ample and coherent learning of KGs and user-item interactions, via our proposed Collaborative Guidance Mechanism. Specifically, CG-KGR first encapsulates historical interactions to interactive information summarization. Then CG-KGR utilizes it as guidance to extract information out of KGs, which eventually provides more precise personalized recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets over two recommendation tasks, i.e., Top-K recommendation and Click-Through rate (CTR) prediction. The experimental results show that the CG-KGR model significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art models by 4.0-53.2% and 0.4-3.2%, in terms of Recall metric on Top-K recommendation and AUC on CTR prediction, respectively.

**Abstract:** The recent progress in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning(MADRL) makes it more practical in real-world tasks, but its relatively poor scalability and the partially observable constraints raise challenges to its performance and deployment. Based on our intuitive observation that the human society could be regarded as a large-scale partially observable environment, where each individual has the function of communicating with neighbors and remembering its own experience, we propose a novel network structure called hierarchical graph recurrent network(HGRN) for multi-agent cooperation under partial observability. Specifically, we construct the multi-agent system as a graph, use the hierarchical graph attention network(HGAT) to achieve communication between neighboring agents, and exploit GRU to enable agents to record historical information. To encourage exploration and improve robustness, we design a maximum-entropy learning method to learn stochastic policies of a configurable target action entropy. Based on the above technologies, we proposed a value-based MADRL algorithm called Soft-HGRN and its actor-critic variant named SAC-HRGN. Experimental results based on three homogeneous tasks and one heterogeneous environment not only show that our approach achieves clear improvements compared with four baselines, but also demonstrates the interpretability, scalability, and transferability of the proposed model. Ablation studies prove the function and necessity of each component.

**Abstract:** Image compression is a method to remove spatial redundancy between adjacent pixels and reconstruct a high-quality image. In the past few years, deep learning has gained huge attention from the research community and produced promising image reconstruction results. Therefore, recent methods focused on developing deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased network complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed: analysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our network utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve the whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce unnecessary information. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed variable-rate framework with novel blocks outperforms existing methods and standard image codecs, such as George's ~\cite{002} and JPEG in terms of image similarity.

**Abstract:** Knowledge transfer across several streaming processes remain challenging problem not only because of different distributions of each stream but also because of rapidly changing and never-ending environments of data streams. Albeit growing research achievements in this area, most of existing works are developed for a single source domain which limits its resilience to exploit multi-source domains being beneficial to recover from concept drifts quickly and to avoid the negative transfer problem. An online domain adaptation technique under multisource streaming processes, namely automatic online multi-source domain adaptation (AOMSDA), is proposed in this paper. The online domain adaptation strategy of AOMSDA is formulated under a coupled generative and discriminative approach of denoising autoencoder (DAE) where the central moment discrepancy (CMD)-based regularizer is integrated to handle the existence of multi-source domains thereby taking advantage of complementary information sources. The asynchronous concept drifts taking place at different time periods are addressed by a self-organizing structure and a node re-weighting strategy. Our numerical study demonstrates that AOMSDA is capable of outperforming its counterparts in 5 of 8 study cases while the ablation study depicts the advantage of each learning component. In addition, AOMSDA is general for any number of source streams. The source code of AOMSDA is shared publicly in https://github.com/Renchunzi-Xie/AOMSDA.git.

**Abstract:** Computer vision has witnessed several advances in recent years, with unprecedented performance provided by deep representation learning research. Image formats thus appear attractive to other fields such as malware detection, where deep learning on images alleviates the need for comprehensively hand-crafted features generalising to different malware variants. We postulate that this research direction could become the next frontier in Android malware detection, and therefore requires a clear roadmap to ensure that new approaches indeed bring novel contributions. We contribute with a first building block by developing and assessing a baseline pipeline for image-based malware detection with straightforward steps. We propose DexRay, which converts the bytecode of the app DEX files into grey-scale "vector" images and feeds them to a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model. We view DexRay as foundational due to the exceedingly basic nature of the design choices, allowing to infer what could be a minimal performance that can be obtained with image-based learning in malware detection. The performance of DexRay evaluated on over 158k apps demonstrates that, while simple, our approach is effective with a high detection rate(F1-score= 0.96). Finally, we investigate the impact of time decay and image-resizing on the performance of DexRay and assess its resilience to obfuscation. This work-in-progress paper contributes to the domain of Deep Learning based Malware detection by providing a sound, simple, yet effective approach (with available artefacts) that can be the basis to scope the many profound questions that will need to be investigated to fully develop this domain.

**Abstract:** Autonomous vehicles must reason about spatial occlusions in urban environments to ensure safety without being overly cautious. Prior work explored occlusion inference from observed social behaviors of road agents, hence treating people as sensors. Inferring occupancy from agent behaviors is an inherently multimodal problem; a driver may behave similarly for different occupancy patterns ahead of them (e.g., a driver may move at constant speed in traffic or on an open road). Past work, however, does not account for this multimodality, thus neglecting to model this source of aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship between driver behaviors and their environment. We propose an occlusion inference method that characterizes observed behaviors of human agents as sensor measurements, and fuses them with those from a standard sensor suite. To capture the aleatoric uncertainty, we train a conditional variational autoencoder with a discrete latent space to learn a multimodal mapping from observed driver trajectories to an occupancy grid representation of the view ahead of the driver. Our method handles multi-agent scenarios, combining measurements from multiple observed drivers using evidential theory to solve the sensor fusion problem. Our approach is validated on a real-world dataset, outperforming baselines and demonstrating real-time capable performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/sisl/MultiAgentVariationalOcclusionInference .

**Abstract:** Phishing attacks are among emerging security issues that recently draws significant attention in the cyber security community. There are numerous existing approaches for phishing URL detection. However, malicious URL detection is still a research hotspot because attackers can bypass newly introduced detection mechanisms by changing their tactics. This paper will introduce a transformer-based malicious URL detection model, which has significant accuracy and outperforms current detection methods. We conduct experiments and compare them with six existing classical detection models. Experiments demonstrate that our transformer-based model is the best performing model from all perspectives among the seven models and achieves 97.3 % of detection accuracy.

**Abstract:** Objective: To propose novel SSVEP classification methodologies using deep neural networks (DNNs) and improve performances in single-channel and user-independent brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with small data lengths. Approach: We propose the utilization of filter banks (creating sub-band components of the EEG signal) in conjunction with DNNs. In this context, we created three different models: a recurrent neural network (FBRNN) analyzing the time domain, a 2D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-2D) processing complex spectrum features and a 3D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-3D) analyzing complex spectrograms, which we introduce in this study as possible input for SSVEP classification. We trained our neural networks with an open dataset and conceived them so as not to require calibration from the final user: therefore, the test subject data was separated from training and validation. Results: The DNNs with the filter banks surpassed the accuracy of similar networks without this preprocessing step by considerable margins (up to 4.6%), and they outperformed common SSVEP classification methods (SVM and FBCCA) by even higher margins (up to 7.1%). Out of the three DNNs using filter banks, the best results were obtained by the FBRNN, followed by the FBCNN-3D, and finally by the FBCNN-2D. Conclusion and significance: Filter banks allow different types of deep neural networks to more efficiently analyze the harmonic components of SSVEP. Complex spectrograms carry more information than complex spectrum features and magnitude spectrum, allowing the FBCNN-3D to surpass the other CNNs. The mean test accuracy (87.3%) and F1-Score (0.877) obtained in the challenging classification problem indicates a strong potential for the construction of portable, economical, fast and low-latency BCIs.
