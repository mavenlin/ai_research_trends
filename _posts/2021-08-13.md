**Abstract:** The last half-decade has seen a steep rise in the number of contributions on safe learning methods for real-world robotic deployments from both the control and reinforcement learning communities. This article provides a concise but holistic review of the recent advances made in using machine learning to achieve safe decision making under uncertainties, with a focus on unifying the language and frameworks used in control theory and reinforcement learning research. Our review includes: learning-based control approaches that safely improve performance by learning the uncertain dynamics, reinforcement learning approaches that encourage safety or robustness, and methods that can formally certify the safety of a learned control policy. As data- and learning-based robot control methods continue to gain traction, researchers must understand when and how to best leverage them in real-world scenarios where safety is imperative, such as when operating in close proximity to humans. We highlight some of the open challenges that will drive the field of robot learning in the coming years, and emphasize the need for realistic physics-based benchmarks to facilitate fair comparisons between control and reinforcement learning approaches.

**Abstract:** Recent work building open-domain chatbots has demonstrated that increasing model size improves performance. On the other hand, latency and connectivity considerations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a digital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant the ability to discuss just about anything leads to the need for reducing the chatbot model size such that it fits on the user's device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can simultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while improving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework that accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout multi-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic responses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing transactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital assistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4 public benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA - Sensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish comparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel split learning framework with multiple end-systems in order to realize privacypreserving deep neural network computation. In conventional split learning frameworks, deep neural network computation is separated into multiple computing systems for hiding entire network architectures. In our proposed framework, multiple computing end-systems are sharing one centralized server in split learning computation, where the multiple end-systems are with input and first hidden layers and the centralized server is with the other hidden layers and output layer. This framework, which is called as spatio-temporal split learning, is spatially separated for gathering data from multiple end-systems and also temporally separated due to the nature of split learning. Our performance evaluation verifies that our proposed framework shows nearoptimal accuracy while preserving data privacy.

**Abstract:** We address the problem of learning self-supervised representations from unlabeled image collections. Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each input image or by speculatively picking negative samples, we instead also make use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human supervision. We present results on four different camera trap image collections, across three different families of self-supervised learning methods, and show that careful image selection at training time results in superior performance compared to existing baselines such as conventional self-supervised training and transfer learning.

**Abstract:** Time is an important dimension in our physical world. Lots of facts can evolve with respect to time. For example, the U.S. President might change every four years. Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and empower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA datasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for diagnosing or benchmarking the model's temporal reasoning capability. In order to promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive QA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from WikiData and aligning them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing crowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating question-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset poses challenges in the aspect of both temporal understanding and temporal reasoning. We evaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our dataset. The best-performing model FiD can only achieve 46\% accuracy, still far behind the human performance of 87\%. We demonstrate that these models are still lacking the ability to perform consistent temporal reasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to develop NLP models more sensitive to temporal shifts. The dataset and code are released in~\url{https://github.com/wenhuchen/Time-Sensitive-QA}.

**Abstract:** Creating abstractive summaries from meeting transcripts has proven to be challenging due to the limited amount of labeled data available for training neural network models. Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to beat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data, such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly. We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2 score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also, a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these summaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important information from the transcripts.

**Abstract:** Artificial speech synthesis has made a great leap in terms of naturalness as recent Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems are capable of producing speech with similar quality to human recordings. However, not all speaking styles are easy to model: highly expressive voices are still challenging even to recent TTS architectures since there seems to be a trade-off between expressiveness in a generated audio and its signal quality. In this paper, we present a set of techniques that can be leveraged to enhance the signal quality of a highly-expressive voice without the use of additional data. The proposed techniques include: tuning the autoregressive loop's granularity during training; using Generative Adversarial Networks in acoustic modelling; and the use of Variational Auto-Encoders in both the acoustic model and the neural vocoder. We show that, when combined, these techniques greatly closed the gap in perceived naturalness between the baseline system and recordings by 39% in terms of MUSHRA scores for an expressive celebrity voice.

**Abstract:** Algorithmic decision support is rapidly becoming a staple of personalized medicine, especially for high-stakes recommendations in which access to certain information can drastically alter the course of treatment, and thus, patient outcome; a prominent example is radiomics for cancer subtyping. Because in these scenarios the stakes are high, it is desirable for decision systems to not only provide recommendations but supply transparent reasoning in support thereof. For learning-based systems, this can be achieved through an interpretable design of the inference pipeline. Herein we describe an automated yet interpretable system for uveal melanoma subtyping with digital cytology images from fine needle aspiration biopsies. Our method embeds every automatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D manifold defined by many representative slides, which enables reasoning about the cell-level composition of the tissue sample, paving the way for interpretable subtyping of the biopsy. Finally, a rule-based slide-level classification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly distorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is evaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our in house cytology dataset of 88 uveal melanoma patients, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 87.5% that compares favorably to all competing approaches, including deep "black box" models. The method comes with a user interface to facilitate interaction with cell-level content, which may offer additional insights for pathological assessment.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift. Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features. Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper, motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize, which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift scenarios.

**Abstract:** In recent years graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches have become a popular strategy for processing point cloud data, regularly achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. To date, the research community has primarily focused on improving model expressiveness, with secondary thought given to how to design models that can run efficiently on resource constrained mobile devices including smartphones or mixed reality headsets. In this work we make a step towards improving the efficiency of these models by making the observation that these GNN models are heavily limited by the representational power of their first, feature extracting, layer. We find that it is possible to radically simplify these models so long as the feature extraction layer is retained with minimal degradation to model performance; further, we discover that it is possible to improve performance overall on ModelNet40 and S3DIS by improving the design of the feature extractor. Our approach reduces memory consumption by 20$\times$ and latency by up to 9.9$\times$ for graph layers in models such as DGCNN; overall, we achieve speed-ups of up to 4.5$\times$ and peak memory reductions of 72.5%.

**Abstract:** Data-driven learning algorithms are employed in many online applications, in which data become available over time, like network monitoring, stock price prediction, job applications, etc. The underlying data distribution might evolve over time calling for model adaptation as new instances arrive and old instances become obsolete. In such dynamic environments, the so-called data streams, fairness-aware learning cannot be considered as a one-off requirement, but rather it should comprise a continual requirement over the stream. Recent fairness-aware stream classifiers ignore the problem of class imbalance, which manifests in many real-life applications, and mitigate discrimination mainly because they "reject" minority instances at large due to their inability to effectively learn all classes.
  In this work, we propose \ours, an online fairness-aware approach that maintains a valid and fair classifier over the stream. \ours~is an online boosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online fashion by monitoring stream's class imbalance and tweaks its decision boundary to mitigate discriminatory outcomes over the stream. Experiments on 8 real-world and 1 synthetic datasets from different domains with varying class imbalance demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art fairness-aware stream approaches with a range (relative) increase [11.2\%-14.2\%] in balanced accuracy, [22.6\%-31.8\%] in gmean, [42.5\%-49.6\%] in recall, [14.3\%-25.7\%] in kappa and [89.4\%-96.6\%] in statistical parity (fairness).

**Abstract:** Fine-grained population distribution data is of great importance for many applications, e.g., urban planning, traffic scheduling, epidemic modeling, and risk control. However, due to the limitations of data collection, including infrastructure density, user privacy, and business security, such fine-grained data is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available. Thus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained distribution becomes an important problem. To tackle this problem, existing methods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which is not often available for the majority of cities. That limits the applications of these methods and brings the necessity to transfer knowledge between data-sufficient source cities to data-scarce target cities.
  In knowledge transfer scenario, we employ single reference fine-grained ground truth in target city, which is easy to obtain via remote sensing or questionnaire, as the ground truth to inform the large-scale urban structure and support the knowledge transfer in target city. By this approach, we transform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a one-shot transfer learning problem. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot transfer learning framework PSRNet to transfer spatial-temporal knowledge across cities from the view of network structure, the view of data, and the view of optimization.
  Experiments on real-life datasets of 4 cities demonstrate that PSRNet has significant advantages over 8 state-of-the-art baselines by reducing RMSE and MAE by more than 25%. Our code and datasets are released in Github (https://github.com/erzhuoshao/PSRNet-CIKM).

**Abstract:** Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, most existing learning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated medical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts, and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of 90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream tasks, such as medical image synthesis and registration.

**Abstract:** Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality, first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and limitations in current literature along with possible future research directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.

**Abstract:** The sequential structure of language, and the order of words in a sentence specifically, plays a central role in human language processing. Consequently, in designing computational models of language, the de facto approach is to present sentences to machines with the words ordered in the same order as in the original human-authored sentence. The very essence of this work is to question the implicit assumption that this is desirable and inject theoretical soundness into the consideration of word order in natural language processing. In this thesis, we begin by uniting the disparate treatments of word order in cognitive science, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing under a flexible algorithmic framework. We proceed to use this heterogeneous theoretical foundation as the basis for exploring new word orders with an undercurrent of psycholinguistic optimality. In particular, we focus on notions of dependency length minimization given the difficulties in human and computational language processing in handling long-distance dependencies. We then discuss algorithms for finding optimal word orders efficiently in spite of the combinatorial space of possibilities. We conclude by addressing the implications of these word orders on human language and their downstream impacts when integrated in computational models.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in deep learning, computer vision, and embodied AI have given rise to synthetic causal reasoning video datasets. These datasets facilitate the development of AI algorithms that can reason about physical interactions between objects. However, datasets thus far have primarily focused on elementary physical events such as rolling or falling. There is currently a scarcity of datasets that focus on the physical interactions that humans perform daily with objects in the real world. To address this scarcity, we introduce SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in 3D Environments. The SPACE simulator allows us to generate the SPACE dataset, a synthetic video dataset in a 3D environment, to systematically evaluate physics-based models on a range of physical causal reasoning tasks. Inspired by daily object interactions, the SPACE dataset comprises videos depicting three types of physical events: containment, stability and contact. These events make up the vast majority of the basic physical interactions between objects. We then further evaluate it with a state-of-the-art physics-based deep model and show that the SPACE dataset improves the learning of intuitive physics with an approach inspired by curriculum learning.

**Abstract:** In the last years, AI systems, in particular neural networks, have seen a tremendous increase in performance, and they are now used in a broad range of applications. Unlike classical symbolic AI systems, neural networks are trained using large data sets and their inner structure containing possibly billions of parameters does not lend itself to human interpretation. As a consequence, it is so far not feasible to provide broad guarantees for the correct behaviour of neural networks during operation if they process input data that significantly differ from those seen during training. However, many applications of AI systems are security- or safety-critical, and hence require obtaining statements on the robustness of the systems when facing unexpected events, whether they occur naturally or are induced by an attacker in a targeted way. As a step towards developing robust AI systems for such applications, this paper presents how the robustness of AI systems can be practically examined and which methods and metrics can be used to do so. The robustness testing methodology is described and analysed for the example use case of traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving.

**Abstract:** We present VESPA, an intentionally simple yet novel zero-shot system for layout, locale, and domain agnostic document extraction. In spite of the availability of large corpora of documents, the lack of labeled and validated datasets makes it a challenge to discriminatively train document extraction models for enterprises. We show that this problem can be addressed by simply transferring the information extraction (IE) task to a natural language Question-Answering (QA) task without engineering task-specific architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by evaluating on a closed corpus of real-world retail and tax invoices with multiple complex layouts, domains, and geographies. The empirical evaluation shows that our system outperforms 4 prominent commercial invoice solutions that use discriminatively trained models with architectures specifically crafted for invoice extraction. We extracted 6 fields with zero upfront human annotation or training with an Avg. F1 of 87.50.

**Abstract:** We present a new subspace-based method to construct probabilistic models for high-dimensional data and highlight its use in anomaly detection. The approach is based on a statistical estimation of probability density using densities of random subspaces combined with geometric averaging. In selecting random subspaces, equal representation of each attribute is used to ensure correct statistical limits. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are used to create the probability densities for each subspace with techniques included to mitigate singularities allowing for the ability to handle both numerical and categorial attributes. The number of components for each GMM is determined automatically through Bayesian information criterion to prevent overfitting. The proposed algorithm attains competitive AUC scores compared with prominent algorithms against benchmark anomaly detection datasets with the added benefits of being simple, scalable, and interpretable.

**Abstract:** Identifying algorithms for computational efficient unsupervised training of large language models is an important and active area of research. In this work, we develop and study a straightforward, dynamic always-sparse pre-training approach for BERT language modeling task, which leverages periodic compression steps based on magnitude pruning followed by random parameter re-allocation. This approach enables us to achieve Pareto improvements in terms of the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) over statically sparse and dense models across a broad spectrum of network sizes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training remains FLOP-efficient when using coarse-grained block sparsity, making it particularly promising for efficient execution on modern hardware accelerators.

**Abstract:** Our daily human life is filled with a myriad of joint action moments, be it children playing, adults working together (i.e., team sports), or strangers navigating through a crowd. Joint action brings individuals (and embodiment of their emotions) together, in space and in time. Yet little is known about how individual emotions propagate through embodied presence in a group, and how joint action changes individual emotion. In fact, the multi-agent component is largely missing from neuroscience-based approaches to emotion, and reversely joint action research has not found a way yet to include emotion as one of the key parameters to model socio-motor interaction. In this review, we first identify the gap and then stockpile evidence showing strong entanglement between emotion and acting together from various branches of sciences. We propose an integrative approach to bridge the gap, highlight five research avenues to do so in behavioral neuroscience and digital sciences, and address some of the key challenges in the area faced by modern societies.

**Abstract:** Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set.
  In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-agent navigation in partially observable grid environments. This problem is challenging for centralized planning approaches as they, typically, rely on the full knowledge of the environment. We suggest utilizing the reinforcement learning approach when the agents, first, learn the policies that map observations to actions and then follow these policies to reach their goals. To tackle the challenge associated with learning cooperative behavior, i.e. in many cases agents need to yield to each other to accomplish a mission, we use a mixing Q-network that complements learning individual policies. In the experimental evaluation, we show that such approach leads to plausible results and scales well to large number of agents.

**Abstract:** Registration of 3D anatomic structures to their 2D dual fluoroscopic X-ray images is a widely used motion tracking technique. However, deep learning implementation is often impeded by a paucity of medical images and ground truths. In this study, we proposed a transfer learning strategy for 3D-to-2D registration using deep neural networks trained from an artificial dataset. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) and radiographic skull landmarks were automatically created from craniocervical CT data of a female subject. They were used to train a residual network (ResNet) for landmark detection and a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to eliminate the style difference between DRRs and actual X-rays. Landmarks on the X-rays experiencing GAN style translation were detected by the ResNet, and were used in triangulation optimization for 3D-to-2D registration of the skull in actual dual-fluoroscope images (with a non-orthogonal setup, point X-ray sources, image distortions, and partially captured skull regions). The registration accuracy was evaluated in multiple scenarios of craniocervical motions. In walking, learning-based registration for the skull had angular/position errors of 3.9 +- 2.1 deg / 4.6 +- 2.2 mm. However, the accuracy was lower during functional neck activity, due to overly small skull regions imaged on the dual fluoroscopic images at end-range positions. The methodology to strategically augment artificial training data can tackle the complicated skull registration scenario, and has potentials to extend to widespread registration scenarios.

**Abstract:** Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii) is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs) provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree. The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the predictive power associated with each feature.

**Abstract:** The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing resources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS) costs. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI) for Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI reduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the models with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new model to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby, reducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and processing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search time was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement compared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by the AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early Exit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures with minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a class of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest error rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02% for CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset. Further, we implemented this image recognition architecture for other tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks, and, in our experiments, EEEA-Net-C2 outperformed MobileNet-V3 on all of these various tasks.

**Abstract:** Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is the task of extracting triplets of aspect terms, their associated sentiments, and the opinion terms that provide evidence for the expressed sentiments. Previous approaches to ASTE usually simultaneously extract all three components or first identify the aspect and opinion terms, then pair them up to predict their sentiment polarities. In this work, we present a novel paradigm, ASTE-RL, by regarding the aspect and opinion terms as arguments of the expressed sentiment in a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We first focus on sentiments expressed in a sentence, then identify the target aspect and opinion terms for that sentiment. This takes into account the mutual interactions among the triplet's components while improving exploration and sample efficiency. Furthermore, this hierarchical RLsetup enables us to deal with multiple and overlapping triplets. In our experiments, we evaluate our model on existing datasets from laptop and restaurant domains and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/ASTE-RL.

**Abstract:** This paper describes an unsupervised machine learning methodology capable of target tracking and background suppression via a novel dual-model approach. ``Jekyll`` produces a video bit-mask describing an estimate of the locations of moving objects, and ``Hyde`` outputs a pseudo-background frame to subtract from the original input image sequence. These models were trained with a custom-modified version of Cross Entropy Loss.
  Simulated data were used to compare the performance of Jekyll and Hyde against a more traditional supervised Machine Learning approach. The results from these comparisons show that the unsupervised methods developed are competitive in output quality with supervised techniques, without the associated cost of acquiring labeled training data.

**Abstract:** Process mining techniques can help organizations to improve their operational processes. Organizations can benefit from process mining techniques in finding and amending the root causes of performance or compliance problems. Considering the volume of the data and the number of features captured by the information system of today's companies, the task of discovering the set of features that should be considered in root cause analysis can be quite involving. In this paper, we propose a method for finding the set of (aggregated) features with a possible effect on the problem.
  The root cause analysis task is usually done by applying a machine learning technique to the data gathered from the information system supporting the processes. To prevent mixing up correlation and causation, which may happen because of interpreting the findings of machine learning techniques as causal, we propose a method for discovering the structural equation model of the process that can be used for root cause analysis. We have implemented the proposed method as a plugin in ProM and we have evaluated it using two real and synthetic event logs. These experiments show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

**Abstract:** This work presents an unsupervised deep learning scheme that exploiting high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update. Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance. The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and diversity of our proposed method.

**Abstract:** How to explore efficiently is a central problem in multi-armed bandits. In this paper, we introduce the metadata-based multi-task bandit problem, where the agent needs to solve a large number of related multi-armed bandit tasks and can leverage some task-specific features (i.e., metadata) to share knowledge across tasks. As a general framework, we propose to capture task relations through the lens of Bayesian hierarchical models, upon which a Thompson sampling algorithm is designed to efficiently learn task relations, share information, and minimize the cumulative regrets. Two concrete examples for Gaussian bandits and Bernoulli bandits are carefully analyzed. The Bayes regret for Gaussian bandits clearly demonstrates the benefits of information sharing with our algorithm. The proposed method is further supported by extensive experiments.

**Abstract:** We investigate the problem of online learning, which has gained significant attention in recent years due to its applicability in a wide range of fields from machine learning to game theory. Specifically, we study the online optimization of mixable loss functions in a dynamic environment. We introduce online mixture schemes that asymptotically achieves the performance of the best dynamic estimation sequence of the switching oracle with optimal regret redundancies. The best dynamic estimation sequence that we compete against is selected in hindsight with full observation of the loss functions and is allowed to select different optimal estimations in different time intervals (segments). We propose two mixtures in our work. Firstly, we propose a tractable polynomial time complexity algorithm that can achieve the optimal redundancy of the intractable brute force approach. Secondly, we propose an efficient logarithmic time complexity algorithm that can achieve the optimal redundancy up to a constant multiplicity gap. Our results are guaranteed to hold in a strong deterministic sense in an individual sequence manner.

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have proven effective in robot navigation, especially in unknown environments, through directly mapping perception inputs into robot control commands. Most existing methods adopt uniform execution duration with robots taking commands at fixed intervals. As such, the length of execution duration becomes a crucial parameter to the navigation algorithm. In particular, if the duration is too short, then the navigation policy would be executed at a high frequency, with increased training difficulty and high computational cost. Meanwhile, if the duration is too long, then the policy becomes unable to handle complex situations, like those with crowded obstacles. It is thus tricky to find the "sweet" duration range; some duration values may render a DRL model to fail to find a navigation path. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive execution duration to overcome this problem. Specifically, we formulate the navigation task as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) problem to handle adaptive execution duration. We also improve the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm and provide its theoretical guarantee for the specified SMDP problem. We evaluate our approach both in the simulator and on an actual robot. The results show that our approach outperforms the other DRL-based method (with fixed execution duration) by 10.3% in terms of the navigation success rate.

**Abstract:** Mining dense subgraphs where vertices connect closely with each other is a common task when analyzing graphs. A very popular notion in subgraph analysis is core decomposition. Recently, Esfahani et al. presented a probabilistic core decomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) that is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm (PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these vertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices until it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly in biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense sub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not interact much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense subgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a two-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing vertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the graph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that we are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA and with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not identical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and clustering coefficient).

**Abstract:** In the fields of image restoration and image fusion, model-driven methods and data-driven methods are the two representative frameworks. However, both approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The model-driven methods consider the imaging mechanism, which is deterministic and theoretically reasonable; however, they cannot easily model complicated nonlinear problems. The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge learning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical features; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are over-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate the coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been considered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities. We are the first to summarize the coupling approaches into the following three categories: 1) data-driven and model-driven cascading methods; 2) variational models with embedded learning; and 3) model-constrained network learning methods. The typical existing and potential coupling methods for remote sensing image restoration and fusion are introduced with application examples. This paper also gives some new insights into the potential future directions, in terms of both methods and applications.

**Abstract:** This paper formulates the problem of dynamically identifying key topics with proper labels from COVID-19 Tweets to provide an overview of wider public opinion. Nowadays, social media is one of the best ways to connect people through Internet technology, which is also considered an essential part of our daily lives. In late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was reported, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency due to its rapid spread all over the world. The COVID-19 epidemic has affected the use of social media by many people across the globe. Twitter is one of the most influential social media services, which has seen a dramatic increase in its use from the epidemic. Thus dynamic extraction of specific topics with labels from tweets of COVID-19 is a challenging issue for highlighting conversation instead of manual topic labeling approach. In this paper, we propose a framework that automatically identifies the key topics with labels from the tweets using the top Unigram feature of aspect terms cluster from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) generated topics. Our experiment result shows that this dynamic topic identification and labeling approach is effective having the accuracy of 85.48\% with respect to the manual static approach.

**Abstract:** Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is an efficient approach for the control of nonlinear multivariable dynamic systems with constraints, which however requires an accurate plant model. Plant models can often be determined from first principles, parts of the model are however difficult to derive using physical laws alone. In this paper a hybrid Gaussian process (GP) first principles modeling scheme is proposed to overcome this issue, which exploits GPs to model the parts of the dynamic system that are difficult to describe using first principles. GPs not only give accurate predictions, but also quantify the residual uncertainty of this model. It is vital to account for this uncertainty in the control algorithm, to prevent constraint violations and performance deterioration. Monte Carlo samples of the GPs are generated offline to tighten constraints of the NMPC to ensure joint probabilistic constraint satisfaction online. Advantages of our method include fast online evaluation times, possibility to account for online learning alleviating conservativeness, and exploiting the flexibility of GPs and the data efficiency of first principle models. The algorithm is verified on a case study involving a challenging semi-batch bioreactor.

**Abstract:** This paper reports a reduced-order modeling framework of bladed disks on a rotating shaft to simulate the vibration signature of faults like cracks in different components aiming towards simulated data-driven machine learning. We have employed lumped and one-dimensional analytical models of the subcomponents for better insight into the complex dynamic response. The framework seeks to address some of the challenges encountered in analyzing and optimizing fault detection and identification schemes for health monitoring of rotating turbomachinery, including aero-engines. We model the bladed disks and shafts by combining lumped elements and one-dimensional finite elements, leading to a coupled system. The simulation results are in good agreement with previously published data. We model the cracks in a blade analytically with their effective reduced stiffness approximation. Multiple types of faults are modeled, including cracks in the blades of single and two-stage bladed disks, Fan Blade Off (FBO), and Foreign Object Damage (FOD). We have applied aero-engine operational loading conditions to simulate realistic scenarios of online health monitoring. The proposed reduced-order simulation framework will have applications in probabilistic signal modeling, machine learning toward fault signature identification, and parameter estimation with measured vibration signals.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present an efficient and high-performance neural architecture, termed Point-Voxel Transformer (PVT)for 3D deep learning, which deeply integrates both 3D voxel-based and point-based self-attention computation to learn more discriminative features from 3D data. Specifically, we conduct multi-head self-attention (MSA) computation in voxels to obtain the efficient learning pattern and the coarse-grained local features while performing self-attention in points to provide finer-grained information about the global context. In addition, to reduce the cost of MSA computation with high efficiency, we design a cyclic shifted boxing scheme by limiting the MSA computation to non-overlapping local box and also preserving cross-box connection. Evaluated on classification benchmark, our method not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.0% (no voting) but outperforms previous Transformer-based models with 7x measured speedup on average. On part and semantic segmentation, our model also obtains strong performance(86.5% and 68.2% mIoU, respectively). For 3D object detection task, we replace the primitives in Frustrum PointNet with PVT block and achieve an improvement of 8.6% AP.

**Abstract:** Deep Learning has celebrated resounding successes in many application areas of relevance to the Internet-of-Things, for example, computer vision and machine listening. To fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT, these technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge. The obvious challenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly resource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This task relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning, quantization, and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This paper examines the suitability of these techniques for audio classification on microcontrollers. We present an XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a comprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with pruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with XNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small numbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation requirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases significantly, performance degrades, and pruning-and-quantization based compression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to satisfy the same space constraints but requiring about 8x more computation. We show that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and image classification using standard benchmark sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying XNOR to end-to-end audio classification and evaluating it in the context of alternative techniques. All code is publicly available on GitHub.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a communication-efficient parameterization, FedPara, for federated learning (FL) to overcome the burdens on frequent model uploads and downloads. Our method re-parameterizes weight parameters of layers using low-rank weights followed by the Hadamard product. Compared to the conventional low-rank parameterization, our FedPara method is not restricted to low-rank constraints, and thereby it has a far larger capacity. This property enables to achieve comparable performance while requiring 3 to 10 times lower communication costs than the model with the original layers, which is not achievable by the traditional low-rank methods. The efficiency of our method can be further improved by combining with other efficient FL optimizers. In addition, we extend our method to a personalized FL application, pFedPara, which separates parameters into global and local ones. We show that pFedPara outperforms competing personalized FL methods with more than three times fewer parameters.
