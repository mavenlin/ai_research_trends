**Abstract:** The study of generalisation in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to produce RL algorithms whose policies generalise well to novel unseen situations at deployment time, avoiding overfitting to their training environments. Tackling this is vital if we are to deploy reinforcement learning algorithms in real world scenarios, where the environment will be diverse, dynamic and unpredictable. This survey is an overview of this nascent field. We provide a unifying formalism and terminology for discussing different generalisation problems, building upon previous works. We go on to categorise existing benchmarks for generalisation, as well as current methods for tackling the generalisation problem. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the current state of the field, including recommendations for future work. Among other conclusions, we argue that taking a purely procedural content generation approach to benchmark design is not conducive to progress in generalisation, we suggest fast online adaptation and tackling RL-specific problems as some areas for future work on methods for generalisation, and we recommend building benchmarks in underexplored problem settings such as offline RL generalisation and reward-function variation.

**Abstract:** Contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) encoders have been shown to be beneficial for a range of visual tasks from classification and detection to captioning and image manipulation. We investigate the effectiveness of CLIP visual backbones for embodied AI tasks. We build incredibly simple baselines, named EmbCLIP, with no task specific architectures, inductive biases (such as the use of semantic maps), auxiliary tasks during training, or depth maps -- yet we find that our improved baselines perform very well across a range of tasks and simulators. EmbCLIP tops the RoboTHOR ObjectNav leaderboard by a huge margin of 20 pts (Success Rate). It tops the iTHOR 1-Phase Rearrangement leaderboard, beating the next best submission, which employs Active Neural Mapping, and more than doubling the % Fixed Strict metric (0.08 to 0.17). It also beats the winners of the 2021 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge, which employ auxiliary tasks, depth maps, and human demonstrations, and those of the 2019 Habitat PointNav Challenge. We evaluate the ability of CLIP's visual representations at capturing semantic information about input observations -- primitives that are useful for navigation-heavy embodied tasks -- and find that CLIP's representations encode these primitives more effectively than ImageNet-pretrained backbones. Finally, we extend one of our baselines, producing an agent capable of zero-shot object navigation that can navigate to objects that were not used as targets during training.

**Abstract:** Sketching is a natural and effective visual communication medium commonly used in creative processes. Recent developments in deep-learning models drastically improved machines' ability in understanding and generating visual content. An exciting area of development explores deep-learning approaches used to model human sketches, opening opportunities for creative applications. This chapter describes three fundamental steps in developing deep-learning-driven creativity support tools that consumes and generates sketches: 1) a data collection effort that generated a new paired dataset between sketches and mobile user interfaces; 2) a sketch-based user interface retrieval system adapted from state-of-the-art computer vision techniques; and, 3) a conversational sketching system that supports the novel interaction of a natural-language-based sketch/critique authoring process. In this chapter, we survey relevant prior work in both the deep-learning and human-computer-interaction communities, document the data collection process and the systems' architectures in detail, present qualitative and quantitative results, and paint the landscape of several future research directions in this exciting area.

**Abstract:** The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a critical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining their microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform metagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes. Despite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important property of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the metagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep Contrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can efficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and robust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add simulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to produce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the distorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and handle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous state-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most near-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17\% more reconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the performance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes and 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result. Impressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single CLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and Maxbin on the benchmarking datasets. CLMB is open-source and available at https://github.com/zpf0117b/CLMB/.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a new pre-trained language model, DeBERTaV3, which improves the original DeBERTa model by replacing mask language modeling (MLM) with replaced token detection (RTD), a more sample-efficient pre-training task. Our analysis shows that vanilla embedding sharing in ELECTRA hurts training efficiency and model performance. This is because the training losses of the discriminator and the generator pull token embeddings in different directions, creating the "tug-of-war" dynamics. We thus propose a new gradient-disentangled embedding sharing method that avoids the tug-of-war dynamics, improving both training efficiency and the quality of the pre-trained model. We have pre-trained DeBERTaV3 using the same settings as DeBERTa to demonstrate its exceptional performance on a wide range of downstream natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Taking the GLUE benchmark with eight tasks as an example, the DeBERTaV3 Large model achieves a 91.37% average score, which is 1.37% over DeBERTa and 1.91% over ELECTRA, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the models with a similar structure. Furthermore, we have pre-trained a multi-lingual model mDeBERTa and observed a larger improvement over strong baselines compared to English models. For example, the mDeBERTa Base achieves a 79.8% zero-shot cross-lingual accuracy on XNLI and a 3.6% improvement over XLM-R Base, creating a new SOTA on this benchmark. We have made our pre-trained models and inference code publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa.

**Abstract:** In December 2019, a novel virus called COVID-19 had caused an enormous number of causalities to date. The battle with the novel Coronavirus is baffling and horrifying after the Spanish Flu 2019. While the front-line doctors and medical researchers have made significant progress in controlling the spread of the highly contiguous virus, technology has also proved its significance in the battle. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence has been adopted in many medical applications to diagnose many diseases, even baffling experienced doctors. Therefore, this survey paper explores the methodologies proposed that can aid doctors and researchers in early and inexpensive methods of diagnosis of the disease. Most developing countries have difficulties carrying out tests using the conventional manner, but a significant way can be adopted with Machine and Deep Learning. On the other hand, the access to different types of medical images has motivated the researchers. As a result, a mammoth number of techniques are proposed. This paper first details the background knowledge of the conventional methods in the Artificial Intelligence domain. Following that, we gather the commonly used datasets and their use cases to date. In addition, we also show the percentage of researchers adopting Machine Learning over Deep Learning. Thus we provide a thorough analysis of this scenario. Lastly, in the research challenges, we elaborate on the problems faced in COVID-19 research, and we address the issues with our understanding to build a bright and healthy environment.

**Abstract:** Limited computational budgets often prevent transformers from being used in production and from having their high accuracy utilized. TinyBERT addresses the computational efficiency by self-distilling BERT into a smaller transformer representation having fewer layers and smaller internal embedding. However, TinyBERT's performance drops when we reduce the number of layers by 50%, and drops even more abruptly when we reduce the number of layers by 75% for advanced NLP tasks such as span question answering. Additionally, a separate model must be trained for each inference scenario with its distinct computational budget. In this work we present Dynamic-TinyBERT, a TinyBERT model that utilizes sequence-length reduction and Hyperparameter Optimization for enhanced inference efficiency per any computational budget. Dynamic-TinyBERT is trained only once, performing on-par with BERT and achieving an accuracy-speedup trade-off superior to any other efficient approaches (up to 3.3x with <1% loss-drop). Upon publication, the code to reproduce our work will be open-sourced.

**Abstract:** Differentiable Wavetable Synthesis (DWTS) is a technique for neural audio synthesis which learns a dictionary of one-period waveforms i.e. wavetables, through end-to-end training. We achieve high-fidelity audio synthesis with as little as 10 to 20 wavetables and demonstrate how a data-driven dictionary of waveforms opens up unprecedented one-shot learning paradigms on short audio clips. Notably, we show audio manipulations, such as high quality pitch-shifting, using only a few seconds of input audio. Lastly, we investigate performance gains from using learned wavetables for realtime and interactive audio synthesis.

**Abstract:** How much does a given trained model leak about each individual data record in its training set? Membership inference attacks are used as an auditing tool to quantify the private information that a model leaks about the individual data points in its training set. Membership inference attacks are influenced by different uncertainties that an attacker has to resolve about training data, the training algorithm, and the underlying data distribution. Thus attack success rates, of many attacks in the literature, do not precisely capture the information leakage of models about their data, as they also reflect other uncertainties that the attack algorithm has. In this paper, we explain the implicit assumptions and also the simplifications made in prior work using the framework of hypothesis testing. We also derive new attack algorithms from the framework that can achieve a high AUC score while also highlighting the different factors that affect their performance. Our algorithms capture a very precise approximation of privacy loss in models, and can be used as a tool to perform an accurate and informed estimation of privacy risk in machine learning models. We provide a thorough empirical evaluation of our attack strategies on various machine learning tasks and benchmark datasets.

**Abstract:** Recent unsupervised representation learning methods have shown to be effective in a range of vision tasks by learning representations invariant to data augmentations such as random cropping and color jittering. However, such invariance could be harmful to downstream tasks if they rely on the characteristics of the data augmentations, e.g., location- or color-sensitive. This is not an issue just for unsupervised learning; we found that this occurs even in supervised learning because it also learns to predict the same label for all augmented samples of an instance. To avoid such failures and obtain more generalizable representations, we suggest to optimize an auxiliary self-supervised loss, coined AugSelf, that learns the difference of augmentation parameters (e.g., cropping positions, color adjustment intensities) between two randomly augmented samples. Our intuition is that AugSelf encourages to preserve augmentation-aware information in learned representations, which could be beneficial for their transferability. Furthermore, AugSelf can easily be incorporated into recent state-of-the-art representation learning methods with a negligible additional training cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our simple idea consistently improves the transferability of representations learned by supervised and unsupervised methods in various transfer learning scenarios.

**Abstract:** One of the key elements of reconstructing a 3D mesh from a monocular video is generating every frame's depth map. However, in the application of colonoscopy video reconstruction, producing good-quality depth estimation is challenging. Neural networks can be easily fooled by photometric distractions or fail to capture the complex shape of the colon surface, predicting defective shapes that result in broken meshes. Aiming to fundamentally improve the depth estimation quality for colonoscopy 3D reconstruction, in this work we have designed a set of training losses to deal with the special challenges of colonoscopy data. For better training, a set of geometric consistency objectives was developed, using both depth and surface normal information. Also, the classic photometric loss was extended with feature matching to compensate for illumination noise. With the training losses powerful enough, our self-supervised framework named ColDE is able to produce better depth maps of colonoscopy data as compared to the previous work utilizing prior depth knowledge. Used in reconstruction, our network is able to reconstruct good-quality colon meshes in real-time without any post-processing, making it the first to be clinically applicable.

**Abstract:** Operating in the real-world often requires agents to learn about a complex environment and apply this understanding to achieve a breadth of goals. This problem, known as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), becomes especially challenging for long-horizon goals. Current methods have tackled this problem by augmenting goal-conditioned policies with graph-based planning algorithms. However, they struggle to scale to large, high-dimensional state spaces and assume access to exploration mechanisms for efficiently collecting training data. In this work, we introduce Successor Feature Landmarks (SFL), a framework for exploring large, high-dimensional environments so as to obtain a policy that is proficient for any goal. SFL leverages the ability of successor features (SF) to capture transition dynamics, using it to drive exploration by estimating state-novelty and to enable high-level planning by abstracting the state-space as a non-parametric landmark-based graph. We further exploit SF to directly compute a goal-conditioned policy for inter-landmark traversal, which we use to execute plans to "frontier" landmarks at the edge of the explored state space. We show in our experiments on MiniGrid and ViZDoom that SFL enables efficient exploration of large, high-dimensional state spaces and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-horizon GCRL tasks.

**Abstract:** Simultaneously evolving morphologies (bodies) and controllers (brains) of robots can cause a mismatch between the inherited body and brain in the offspring. To mitigate this problem, the addition of an infant learning period by the so-called Triangle of Life framework has been proposed relatively long ago. However, an empirical assessment is still lacking to-date. In this paper we investigate the effects of such a learning mechanism from different perspectives. Using extensive simulations we show that learning can greatly increase task performance and reduce the number of generations required to reach a certain fitness level compared to the purely evolutionary approach. Furthermore, although learning only directly affects the controllers, we demonstrate that the evolved morphologies will be also different. This provides a quantitative demonstration that changes in the brain can induce changes in the body. Finally, we examine the concept of morphological intelligence quantified by the ability of a given body to learn. We observe that the learning delta, the performance difference between the inherited and the learned brain, is growing throughout the evolutionary process. This shows that evolution is producing robots with an increasing plasticity, that is, consecutive generations are becoming better and better learners which in turn makes them better and better at the given task. All in all, our results demonstrate that the Triangle of Life is not only a concept of theoretical interest, but a system architecture with practical benefits.

**Abstract:** Uncertainty quantification in neural network promises to increase safety of AI systems, but it is not clear how performance might vary with the training set size. In this paper we evaluate seven uncertainty methods on Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10, as we sub-sample and produce varied training set sizes. We find that calibration error and out of distribution detection performance strongly depend on the training set size, with most methods being miscalibrated on the test set with small training sets. Gradient-based methods seem to poorly estimate epistemic uncertainty and are the most affected by training set size. We expect our results can guide future research into uncertainty quantification and help practitioners select methods based on their particular available data.

**Abstract:** We observe a recent behaviour on social media, in which users intentionally remove consonantal dots from Arabic letters, in order to bypass content-classification algorithms. Content classification is typically done by fine-tuning pre-trained language models, which have been recently employed by many natural-language-processing applications. In this work we study the effect of applying pre-trained Arabic language models on "undotted" Arabic texts. We suggest several ways of supporting undotted texts with pre-trained models, without additional training, and measure their performance on two Arabic natural-language-processing downstream tasks. The results are encouraging; in one of the tasks our method shows nearly perfect performance.

**Abstract:** Autonomous robots frequently need to detect "interesting" scenes to decide on further exploration, or to decide which data to share for cooperation. These scenarios often require fast deployment with little or no training data. Prior work considers "interestingness" based on data from the same distribution. Instead, we propose to develop a method that automatically adapts online to the environment to report interesting scenes quickly. To address this problem, we develop a novel translation-invariant visual memory and design a three-stage architecture for long-term, short-term, and online learning, which enables the system to learn human-like experience, environmental knowledge, and online adaption, respectively. With this system, we achieve an average of 20% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in a subterranean tunnel environment. We show comparable performance to supervised methods for robot exploration scenarios showing the efficacy of our approach. We expect that the presented method will play an important role in the robotic interestingness recognition exploration tasks.

**Abstract:** Existing deep learning (DL) based speech enhancement approaches are generally optimised to minimise the distance between clean and enhanced speech features. These often result in improved speech quality however they suffer from a lack of generalisation and may not deliver the required speech intelligibility in real noisy situations. In an attempt to address these challenges, researchers have explored intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions and integration of audio-visual (AV) information for more robust speech enhancement (SE). In this paper, we introduce DL based I-O SE algorithms exploiting AV information, which is a novel and previously unexplored research direction. Specifically, we present a fully convolutional AV SE model that uses a modified short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric as a training cost function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits the integration of AV modalities with an I-O based loss function for SE. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed I-O AV SE framework outperforms audio-only (AO) and AV models trained with conventional distance-based loss functions, in terms of standard objective evaluation measures when dealing with unseen speakers and noises.

**Abstract:** Robustness against unwanted perturbations is an important aspect of deploying neural network classifiers in the real world. Common natural perturbations include noise, saturation, occlusion, viewpoint changes, and blur deformations. All of them can be modelled by the newly proposed transform-augmented convolutional networks. While many approaches for robustness train the network by providing augmented data to the network, we aim to integrate perturbations in the network architecture to achieve improved and more general robustness. To demonstrate that wiggling the weights consistently improves classification, we choose a standard network and modify it to a transform-augmented network. On perturbed CIFAR-10 images, the modified network delivers a better performance than the original network. For the much smaller STL-10 dataset, in addition to delivering better general robustness, wiggling even improves the classification of unperturbed, clean images substantially. We conclude that wiggled transform-augmented networks acquire good robustness even for perturbations not seen during training.

**Abstract:** Graphs are ubiquitous in many applications, such as social networks, knowledge graphs, smart grids, etc.. Graph neural networks (GNN) are the current state-of-the-art for these applications, and yet remain obscure to humans. Explaining the GNN predictions can add transparency. However, as many graphs are not static but continuously evolving, explaining changes in predictions between two graph snapshots is different but equally important. Prior methods only explain static predictions or generate coarse or irrelevant explanations for dynamic predictions. We define the problem of explaining evolving GNN predictions and propose an axiomatic attribution method to uniquely decompose the change in a prediction to paths on computation graphs. The attribution to many paths involving high-degree nodes is still not interpretable, while simply selecting the top important paths can be suboptimal in approximating the change. We formulate a novel convex optimization problem to optimally select the paths that explain the prediction evolution. Theoretically, we prove that the existing method based on Layer-Relevance-Propagation (LRP) is a special case of the proposed algorithm when an empty graph is compared with. Empirically, on seven graph datasets, with a novel metric designed for evaluating explanations of prediction change, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing methods, including LRP, DeepLIFT, and other path selection methods.

**Abstract:** We study a pricing setting where each customer is offered a contextualized price based on customer and/or product features that are predictive of the customer's valuation for that product. Often only historical sales records are available, where we observe whether each customer purchased a product at the price prescribed rather than the customer's true valuation. As such, the data is influenced by the historical sales policy which introduces difficulties in a) estimating future loss/regret for pricing policies without the possibility of conducting real experiments and b) optimizing new policies for downstream tasks such as revenue management. We study how to formulate loss functions which can be used for optimizing pricing policies directly, rather than going through an intermediate demand estimation stage, which can be biased in practice due to model misspecification, regularization or poor calibration. While existing approaches have been proposed when valuation data is available, we propose loss functions for the observational data setting. To achieve this, we adapt ideas from machine learning with corrupted labels, where we can consider each observed customer's outcome (purchased or not for a prescribed price), as a (known) probabilistic transformation of the customer's valuation. From this transformation we derive a class of suitable unbiased loss functions. Within this class we identify minimum variance estimators, those which are robust to poor demand function estimation, and provide guidance on when the estimated demand function is useful. Furthermore, we also show that when applied to our contextual pricing setting, estimators popular in the off-policy evaluation literature fall within this class of loss functions, and also offer managerial insights on when each estimator is likely to perform well in practice.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study mid-cap companies, i.e. publicly traded companies with less than US $10 billion in market capitalisation. Using a large dataset of US mid-cap companies observed over 30 years, we look to predict the default probability term structure over the medium term and understand which data sources (i.e. fundamental, market or pricing data) contribute most to the default risk. Whereas existing methods typically require that data from different time periods are first aggregated and turned into cross-sectional features, we frame the problem as a multi-label time-series classification problem. We adapt transformer models, a state-of-the-art deep learning model emanating from the natural language processing domain, to the credit risk modelling setting. We also interpret the predictions of these models using attention heat maps. To optimise the model further, we present a custom loss function for multi-label classification and a novel multi-channel architecture with differential training that gives the model the ability to use all input data efficiently. Our results show the proposed deep learning architecture's superior performance, resulting in a 13% improvement in AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) over traditional models. We also demonstrate how to produce an importance ranking for the different data sources and the temporal relationships using a Shapley approach specific to these models.

**Abstract:** Domain Adaptation is a technique to address the lack of massive amounts of labeled data in unseen environments. Unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely labeled source data and unlabeled target domain data. Though many image-spaces domain adaptation methods have been proposed to capture pixel-level domain-shift, such techniques may fail to maintain high-level semantic information for the segmentation task. For the case of biomedical images, fine details such as blood vessels can be lost during the image transformation operations between domains. In this work, we propose a model that adapts between domains using cycle-consistent loss while maintaining edge details of the original images by enforcing an edge-based loss during the adaptation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to other approaches on two eye fundus vessels segmentation datasets. We achieve 1.1 to 9.2 increment in DICE score compared to the SOTA and ~5.2 increments compared to a vanilla CycleGAN implementation.

**Abstract:** In this paper we introduce MCCE: Monte Carlo sampling of realistic Counterfactual Explanations, a model-based method that generates counterfactual explanations by producing a set of feasible examples using conditional inference trees. Unlike algorithmic-based counterfactual methods that have to solve complex optimization problems or other model based methods that model the data distribution using heavy machine learning models, MCCE is made up of only two light-weight steps (generation and post-processing). MCCE is also straightforward for the end user to understand and implement, handles any type of predictive model and type of feature, takes into account actionability constraints when generating the counterfactual explanations, and generates as many counterfactual explanations as needed. In this paper we introduce MCCE and give a comprehensive list of performance metrics that can be used to compare counterfactual explanations. We also compare MCCE with a range of state-of-the-art methods and a new baseline method on benchmark data sets. MCCE outperforms all model-based methods and most algorithmic-based methods when also taking into account validity (i.e., a correctly changed prediction) and actionability constraints. Finally, we show that MCCE has the strength of performing almost as well when given just a small subset of the training data.

**Abstract:** Hyperspectral imaging offers new perspectives for diverse applications, ranging from the monitoring of the environment using airborne or satellite remote sensing, precision farming, food safety, planetary exploration, or astrophysics. Unfortunately, the spectral diversity of information comes at the expense of various sources of degradation,  and the lack of accurate ground-truth "clean" hyperspectral signals acquired on the spot makes restoration tasks challenging. In particular, training deep neural networks for restoration is difficult, in contrast to traditional RGB imaging problems where deep models tend to shine. In this paper, we advocate instead for a hybrid approach based on sparse coding principles that retains the interpretability of classical techniques encoding domain knowledge with handcrafted image priors, while allowing to train model parameters end-to-end without massive amounts of data. We show on various denoising benchmarks that our method is computationally efficient and  significantly outperforms the state of the art.

**Abstract:** Many interventional surgical procedures rely on medical imaging to visualise and track instruments. Such imaging methods not only need to be real-time capable, but also provide accurate and robust positional information. In ultrasound applications, typically only two-dimensional data from a linear array are available, and as such obtaining accurate positional estimation in three dimensions is non-trivial. In this work, we first train a neural network, using realistic synthetic training data, to estimate the out-of-plane offset of an object with the associated axial aberration in the reconstructed ultrasound image. The obtained estimate is then combined with a Kalman filtering approach that utilises positioning estimates obtained in previous time-frames to improve localisation robustness and reduce the impact of measurement noise. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using simulations, and its practical applicability is demonstrated on experimental data obtained using a novel optical ultrasound imaging setup. Accurate and robust positional information is provided in real-time. Axial and lateral coordinates for out-of-plane objects are estimated with a mean error of 0.1mm for simulated data and a mean error of 0.2mm for experimental data. Three-dimensional localisation is most accurate for elevational distances larger than 1mm, with a maximum distance of 5mm considered for a 25mm aperture.

**Abstract:** Monitoring news content automatically is an important problem. The news content, unlike traditional text, has a temporal component. However, few works have explored the combination of natural language processing and dynamic system models. One reason is that it is challenging to mathematically model the nuances of natural language. In this paper, we discuss how we built a novel dataset of news articles collected over time. Then, we present a method of converting news text collected over time to a sequence of directed multi-graphs, which represent semantic triples (Subject ! Predicate ! Object). We model the dynamics of specific topological changes from these graphs using discrete-time Hawkes processes. With our real-world data, we show that analyzing the structures of the graphs and the discrete-time Hawkes process model can yield insights on how the news events were covered and how to predict how it may be covered in the future.

**Abstract:** Many unanswerable adversarial questions fool the question-answer (QA) system with some plausible answers. Building a robust, frequently asked questions (FAQ) chatbot needs a large amount of diverse adversarial examples. Recent question generation methods are ineffective at generating many high-quality and diverse adversarial question-answer pairs from unstructured text. We propose the diversity controllable semantically valid adversarial attacker (DCSA), a high-quality, diverse, controllable method to generate standard and adversarial samples with a semantic graph. The fluent and semantically generated QA pairs fool our passage retrieval model successfully. After that, we conduct a study on the robustness and generalization of the QA model with generated QA pairs among different domains. We find that the generated data set improves the generalizability of the QA model to the new target domain and the robustness of the QA model to detect unanswerable adversarial questions.

**Abstract:** In computational reinforcement learning, a growing body of work seeks to express an agent's model of the world through predictions about future sensations. In this manuscript we focus on predictions expressed as General Value Functions: temporally extended estimates of the accumulation of a future signal. One challenge is determining from the infinitely many predictions that the agent could possibly make which might support decision-making. In this work, we contribute a meta-gradient descent method by which an agent can directly specify what predictions it learns, independent of designer instruction. To that end, we introduce a partially observable domain suited to this investigation. We then demonstrate that through interaction with the environment an agent can independently select predictions that resolve the partial-observability, resulting in performance similar to expertly chosen value functions. By learning, rather than manually specifying these predictions, we enable the agent to identify useful predictions in a self-supervised manner, taking a step towards truly autonomous systems.

**Abstract:** The design or simulation analysis of special equipment products must follow the national standards, and hence it may be necessary to repeatedly consult the contents of the standards in the design process. However, it is difficult for the traditional question answering system based on keyword retrieval to give accurate answers to technical questions. Therefore, we use natural language processing techniques to design a question answering system for the decision-making process in pressure vessel design. To solve the problem of insufficient training data for the technology question answering system, we propose a method to generate questions according to a declarative sentence from several different dimensions so that multiple question-answer pairs can be obtained from a declarative sentence. In addition, we designed an interactive attention model based on a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to improve the performance of the similarity comparison of two question sentences. Finally, the performance of the question answering system was tested on public and technical domain datasets.

**Abstract:** COVID-19 quickly became a global pandemic after only four months of its first detection. It is crucial to detect this disease as soon as possible to decrease its spread. The use of chest X-ray (CXR) images became an effective screening strategy, complementary to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often used for automatic image classification and they can be very useful in CXR diagnostics. In this paper, 21 different CNN architectures are tested and compared in the task of identifying COVID-19 in CXR images. They were applied to the COVIDx8B dataset, which is the largest and more diverse COVID-19 dataset available. Ensembles of CNNs were also employed and they showed better efficacy than individual instances. The best individual CNN instance results were achieved by DenseNet169, with an accuracy of 98.15% and an F1 score of 98.12%. These were further increased to 99.25% and 99.24%, respectively, through an ensemble with five instances of DenseNet169. These results are higher than those obtained in recent works using the same dataset.

**Abstract:** As with most Machine Learning systems, recommender systems are typically evaluated through performance metrics computed over held-out data points. However, real-world behavior is undoubtedly nuanced: ad hoc error analysis and deployment-specific tests must be employed to ensure the desired quality in actual deployments. In this paper, we propose RecList, a behavioral-based testing methodology. RecList organizes recommender systems by use case and introduces a general plug-and-play procedure to scale up behavioral testing. We demonstrate its capabilities by analyzing known algorithms and black-box commercial systems, and we release RecList as an open source, extensible package for the community.

**Abstract:** Despite the efficiency and scalability of machine learning systems, recent studies have demonstrated that many classification methods, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), are vulnerable to adversarial examples; i.e., examples that are carefully crafted to fool a well-trained classification model while being indistinguishable from natural data to human. This makes it potentially unsafe to apply DNNs or related methods in security-critical areas. Since this issue was first identified by Biggio et al. (2013) and Szegedy et al.(2014), much work has been done in this field, including the development of attack methods to generate adversarial examples and the construction of defense techniques to guard against such examples. This paper aims to introduce this topic and its latest developments to the statistical community, primarily focusing on the generation and guarding of adversarial examples. Computing codes (in python and R) used in the numerical experiments are publicly available for readers to explore the surveyed methods. It is the hope of the authors that this paper will encourage more statisticians to work on this important and exciting field of generating and defending against adversarial examples.

Diabetes Mellitus which is one of the major diseases can be easily diagnosed by several Machine Learning algorithms. Early stage diagnosis is crucial to prevent dangerous consequences. In this paper we have made a comparative analysis of several machine learning algorithms viz.

**Abstract:** In 2021 the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory held an internal challenge to develop artificially intelligent (AI) agents that could excel at the collaborative card game Hanabi. Agents were evaluated on their ability to play with human players whom the agents had never previously encountered. This study details the development of the agent that won the challenge by achieving a human-play average score of 16.5, outperforming the current state-of-the-art for human-bot Hanabi scores. The winning agent's development consisted of observing and accurately modeling the author's decision making in Hanabi, then training with a behavioral clone of the author. Notably, the agent discovered a human-complementary play style by first mimicking human decision making, then exploring variations to the human-like strategy that led to higher simulated human-bot scores. This work examines in detail the design and implementation of this human compatible Hanabi teammate, as well as the existence and implications of human-complementary strategies and how they may be explored for more successful applications of AI in human machine teams.

**Abstract:** Magnetic Resonance Imaging can produce detailed images of the anatomy and physiology of the human body that can assist doctors in diagnosing and treating pathologies such as tumours. However, MRI suffers from very long acquisition times that make it susceptible to patient motion artifacts and limit its potential to deliver dynamic treatments. Conventional approaches such as Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing allow for an increase in MRI acquisition speed by reconstructing MR images by acquiring less MRI data using multiple receiver coils. Recent advancements in Deep Learning combined with Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing techniques have the potential to produce high-fidelity reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI data. In this work we present a novel Deep Learning-based Inverse Problem solver applied to the task of accelerated MRI reconstruction, called Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet) by exploiting the properties of Convolution Recurrent Networks and unrolled algorithms for solving Inverse Problems. The RecurrentVarNet consists of multiple blocks, each responsible for one unrolled iteration of the gradient descent optimization algorithm for solving inverse problems. Contrary to traditional approaches, the optimization steps are performed in the observation domain ($k$-space) instead of the image domain. Each recurrent block of RecurrentVarNet refines the observed $k$-space and is comprised of a data consistency term and a recurrent unit which takes as input a learned hidden state and the prediction of the previous block. Our proposed method achieves new state of the art qualitative and quantitative reconstruction results on 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data from a public multi-channel brain dataset, outperforming previous conventional and deep learning-based approaches. We will release all models code and baselines on our public repository.

**Abstract:** Despite their success, modern language models are fragile. Even small changes in their training pipeline can lead to unexpected results. We study this phenomenon by examining the robustness of ALBERT (arXiv:1909.11942) in combination with Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) (arXiv:1803.05407) -- a cheap way of ensembling -- on a sentiment analysis task (SST-2). In particular, we analyze SWA's stability via CheckList criteria (arXiv:2005.04118), examining the agreement on errors made by models differing only in their random seed. We hypothesize that SWA is more stable because it ensembles model snapshots taken along the gradient descent trajectory. We quantify stability by comparing the models' mistakes with Fleiss' Kappa (Fleiss, 1971) and overlap ratio scores. We find that SWA reduces error rates in general; yet the models still suffer from their own distinct biases (according to CheckList).

**Abstract:** The deep neural networks (DNNs)based autonomous driving systems (ADSs) are expected to reduce road accidents and improve safety in the transportation domain as it removes the factor of human error from driving tasks. The DNN based ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviors due to unexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. It is not possible to generalize the DNN model performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the driving conditions that were not considered during the training of the ADS may lead to unpredictable consequences for the safety of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis based anomaly detection system to prevent the safety critical inconsistent behavior of autonomous vehicles at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components. The first component, the inconsistent behavior predictor, is based on an autoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct the driving scenarios. Based on reconstruction error and threshold it determines the normal and unexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behavior. The second component provides on the fly safety guards, that is, it automatically activates healing strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the behavior. We evaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected anomalous driving scenarios using already available open sourced DNN based ADSs in the Udacity simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of DeepGuard can predict up to 93 percent on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83 percent on DAVE2 ADS, and 80 percent of inconsistent behavior on the EPOCH ADS model, outperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad. Overall, DeepGuard can prevent up to 89 percent of all predicted inconsistent behaviors of ADS by executing predefined safety guards.

**Abstract:** Continual learning (CL) aims to develop techniques by which a single model adapts to an increasing number of tasks encountered sequentially, thereby potentially leveraging learnings across tasks in a resource-efficient manner. A major challenge for CL systems is catastrophic forgetting, where earlier tasks are forgotten while learning a new task. To address this, replay-based CL approaches maintain and repeatedly retrain on a small buffer of data selected across encountered tasks. We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel strategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed optimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a "coreset" that closely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to current model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective application to the continual learning setting. We show significant gains (2%-4% absolute) over the state-of-the-art in the well-studied offline continual learning setting. Our findings also effectively transfer to online / streaming CL settings, showing upto 5% gains over existing approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the value of supervised contrastive loss for continual learning, which yields a cumulative gain of up to 5% accuracy when combined with our subset selection strategy.

**Abstract:** Existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods are based on a supervised classification framework sensitive to data labels. When updating them based on the new class data, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting: the model cannot discern old class data clearly from the new. In this paper, we explore the performance of Self-Supervised representation learning in Class Incremental Learning (SSCIL) for the first time, which discards data labels and the model's classifiers. To comprehensively discuss the difference in performance between supervised and self-supervised methods in CIL, we set up three different class incremental schemes: Random Class Scheme, Semantic Class Scheme, and Cluster Scheme, to simulate various class incremental learning scenarios. Besides, we propose Linear Evaluation Protocol (LEP) and Generalization Evaluation Protocol (GEP) to metric the model's representation classification ability and generalization in CIL. Our experiments (on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet) show that SSCIL has better anti-forgetting ability and robustness than supervised strategies in CIL. To understand what alleviates the catastrophic forgetting in SSCIL, we study the major components of SSCIL and conclude that (1) the composition of different data augmentation improves the quality of the model's representation and the \textit{Grayscale} operation reduces the system noise of data augmentation in SSCIL. (2) the projector, like a buffer, reduces unnecessary parameter updates of the model in SSCIL and increases the robustness of the model. Although the performance of SSCIL is significantly higher than supervised methods in CIL, there is still an apparent gap with joint learning. Our exploration gives a baseline of self-supervised class incremental learning on large-scale datasets and contributes some forward strategies for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting in CIL.

**Abstract:** The visualization and detection of anomalies (outliers) are of crucial importance to many fields, particularly cybersecurity. Several approaches have been proposed in these fields, yet to the best of our knowledge, none of them has fulfilled both objectives, simultaneously or cooperatively, in one coherent framework. The visualization methods of these approaches were introduced for explaining the output of a detection algorithm, not for data exploration that facilitates a standalone visual detection. This is our point of departure: UN-AVOIDS, an unsupervised and nonparametric approach for both visualization (a human process) and detection (an algorithmic process) of outliers, that assigns invariant anomalous scores (normalized to $[0,1]$), rather than hard binary-decision. The main aspect of novelty of UN-AVOIDS is that it transforms data into a new space, which is introduced in this paper as neighborhood cumulative density function (NCDF), in which both visualization and detection are carried out. In this space, outliers are remarkably visually distinguishable, and therefore the anomaly scores assigned by the detection algorithm achieved a high area under the ROC curve (AUC). We assessed UN-AVOIDS on both simulated and two recently published cybersecurity datasets, and compared it to three of the most successful anomaly detection methods: LOF, IF, and FABOD. In terms of AUC, UN-AVOIDS was almost an overall winner. The article concludes by providing a preview of new theoretical and practical avenues for UN-AVOIDS. Among them is designing a visualization aided anomaly detection (VAAD), a type of software that aids analysts by providing UN-AVOIDS' detection algorithm (running in a back engine), NCDF visualization space (rendered to plots), along with other conventional methods of visualization in the original feature space, all of which are linked in one interactive environment.

**Abstract:** This study is aimed at addressing the problem of fault tolerance of quadruped robots to actuator failure, which is critical for robots operating in remote or extreme environments. In particular, an adaptive curriculum reinforcement learning algorithm with dynamics randomization (ACDR) is established. The ACDR algorithm can adaptively train a quadruped robot in random actuator failure conditions and formulate a single robust policy for fault-tolerant robot control. It is noted that the hard2easy curriculum is more effective than the easy2hard curriculum for quadruped robot locomotion. The ACDR algorithm can be used to build a robot system that does not require additional modules for detecting actuator failures and switching policies. Experimental results show that the ACDR algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of the average reward and walking distance.

**Abstract:** Determinantal point processes (a.k.a. DPPs) have recently become popular tools for modeling the phenomenon of negative dependence, or repulsion, in data. However, our understanding of an analogue of a classical parametric statistical theory is rather limited for this class of models. In this work, we investigate a parametric family of Gaussian DPPs with a clearly interpretable effect of parametric modulation on the observed points. We show that parameter modulation impacts the observed points by introducing directionality in their repulsion structure, and the principal directions correspond to the directions of maximal (i.e. the most long ranged) dependency.
  This model readily yields a novel and viable alternative to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimension reduction tool that favors directions along which the data is most spread out. This methodological contribution is complemented by a statistical analysis of a spiked model similar to that employed for covariance matrices as a framework to study PCA. These theoretical investigations unveil intriguing questions for further examination in random matrix theory, stochastic geometry and related topics.

**Abstract:** The goal of meta-learning is to generalize to new tasks and goals as quickly as possible. Ideally, we would like approaches that generalize to new goals and tasks on the first attempt. Toward that end, we introduce contextual planning networks (CPN). Tasks are represented as goal images and used to condition the approach. We evaluate CPN along with several other approaches adapted for zero-shot goal-directed meta-learning. We evaluate these approaches across 24 distinct manipulation tasks using Metaworld benchmark tasks. We found that CPN outperformed several approaches and baselines on one task and was competitive with existing approaches on others. We demonstrate the approach on a physical platform on Jenga tasks using a Kinova Jaco robotic arm.

**Abstract:** We consider Bayesian best arm identification in the multi-armed bandit problem. Assuming certain continuity conditions of the prior, we characterize the rate of the Bayesian simple regret. Differing from Bayesian regret minimization (Lai, 1987), the leading factor in Bayesian simple regret derives from the region where the gap between optimal and sub-optimal arms is smaller than $\sqrt{\frac{\log T}{T}}$. We propose a simple and easy-to-compute algorithm with its leading factor matches with the lower bound up to a constant factor; simulation results support our theoretical findings.

**Abstract:** The unprecedented volume, diversity and richness of aviation data that can be acquired, generated, stored, and managed provides unique capabilities for the aviation-related industries and pertains value that remains to be unlocked with the adoption of the innovative Big Data Analytics technologies. Despite the large efforts and investments on research and innovation, the Big Data technologies introduce a number of challenges to its adopters. Besides the effective storage and access to the underlying big data, efficient data integration and data interoperability should be considered, while at the same time multiple data sources should be effectively combined by performing data exchange and data sharing between the different stakeholders. However, this reveals additional challenges for the crucial preservation of the information security of the collected data, the trusted and secure data exchange and data sharing, as well as the robust data access control. The current paper aims to introduce the ICARUS big data-enabled platform that aims provide a multi-sided platform that offers a novel aviation data and intelligence marketplace accompanied by a trusted and secure analytics workspace. It holistically handles the complete big data lifecycle from the data collection, data curation and data exploration to the data integration and data analysis of data originating from heterogeneous data sources with different velocity, variety and volume in a trusted and secure manner.

**Abstract:** Despite the increasing relevance of forecasting methods, the causal implications of these algorithms remain largely unexplored. This is concerning considering that, even under simplifying assumptions such as causal sufficiency, the statistical risk of a model can differ significantly from its \textit{causal risk}. Here, we study the problem of *causal generalization* -- generalizing from the observational to interventional distributions -- in forecasting. Our goal is to find answers to the question: How does the efficacy of an autoregressive (VAR) model in predicting statistical associations compare with its ability to predict under interventions?
  To this end, we introduce the framework of *causal learning theory* for forecasting. Using this framework, we obtain a characterization of the difference between statistical and causal risks, which helps identify sources of divergence between them. Under causal sufficiency, the problem of causal generalization amounts to learning under covariate shifts albeit with additional structure (restriction to interventional distributions). This structure allows us to obtain uniform convergence bounds on causal generalizability for the class of VAR models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees for causal generalization in the time-series setting.

**Abstract:** We propose the first near-optimal quantum algorithm for estimating in Euclidean norm the mean of a vector-valued random variable with finite mean and covariance. Our result aims at extending the theory of multivariate sub-Gaussian estimators to the quantum setting. Unlike classically, where any univariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a logarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the quantum setting. Indeed, Heinrich ruled out the existence of a quantum advantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller than the dimension. Our main result is to show that, outside this low-precision regime, there is a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator. Our approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting, where most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation. We exploit a variety of additional algorithmic techniques such as amplitude amplification, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation. Our analysis also uses concentration inequalities for multivariate truncated statistics.
  We develop our quantum estimators in two different input models that showed up in the literature before. The first one provides coherent access to the binary representation of the random variable and it encompasses the classical setting. In the second model, the random variable is directly encoded into the phases of quantum registers. This model arises naturally in many quantum algorithms but it is often incomparable to having classical samples. We adapt our techniques to these two settings and we show that the second model is strictly weaker for solving the mean estimation problem. Finally, we describe several applications of our algorithms, notably in measuring the expectation values of commuting observables and in the field of machine learning.

**Abstract:** The stochastic multi-arm bandit problem has been extensively studied under standard assumptions on the arm's distribution (e.g bounded with known support, exponential family, etc). These assumptions are suitable for many real-world problems but sometimes they require knowledge (on tails for instance) that may not be precisely accessible to the practitioner, raising the question of the robustness of bandit algorithms to model misspecification. In this paper we study a generic Dirichlet Sampling (DS) algorithm, based on pairwise comparisons of empirical indices computed with re-sampling of the arms' observations and a data-dependent exploration bonus. We show that different variants of this strategy achieve provably optimal regret guarantees when the distributions are bounded and logarithmic regret for semi-bounded distributions with a mild quantile condition. We also show that a simple tuning achieve robustness with respect to a large class of unbounded distributions, at the cost of slightly worse than logarithmic asymptotic regret. We finally provide numerical experiments showing the merits of DS in a decision-making problem on synthetic agriculture data.

**Abstract:** Data-hungry deep neural networks have established themselves as the standard for many NLP tasks including the traditional sequence tagging ones. Despite their state-of-the-art performance on high-resource languages, they still fall behind of their statistical counter-parts in low-resource scenarios. One methodology to counter attack this problem is text augmentation, i.e., generating new synthetic training data points from existing data. Although NLP has recently witnessed a load of textual augmentation techniques, the field still lacks a systematic performance analysis on a diverse set of languages and sequence tagging tasks. To fill this gap, we investigate three categories of text augmentation methodologies which perform changes on the syntax (e.g., cropping sub-sentences), token (e.g., random word insertion) and character (e.g., character swapping) levels. We systematically compare them on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and semantic role labeling for a diverse set of language families using various models including the architectures that rely on pretrained multilingual contextualized language models such as mBERT. Augmentation most significantly improves dependency parsing, followed by part-of-speech tagging and semantic role labeling. We find the experimented techniques to be effective on morphologically rich languages in general rather than analytic languages such as Vietnamese. Our results suggest that the augmentation techniques can further improve over strong baselines based on mBERT. We identify the character-level methods as the most consistent performers, while synonym replacement and syntactic augmenters provide inconsistent improvements. Finally, we discuss that the results most heavily depend on the task, language pair, and the model type.

**Abstract:** Minwise hashing (MinHash) is a classical method for efficiently estimating the Jaccrad similarity in massive binary (0/1) data. To generate $K$ hash values for each data vector, the standard theory of MinHash requires $K$ independent permutations. Interestingly, the recent work on "circulant MinHash" (C-MinHash) has shown that merely two permutations are needed. The first permutation breaks the structure of the data and the second permutation is re-used $K$ time in a circulant manner. Surprisingly, the estimation accuracy of C-MinHash is proved to be strictly smaller than that of the original MinHash. The more recent work further demonstrates that practically only one permutation is needed. Note that C-MinHash is different from the well-known work on "One Permutation Hashing (OPH)" published in NIPS'12. OPH and its variants using different "densification" schemes are popular alternatives to the standard MinHash. The densification step is necessary in order to deal with empty bins which exist in One Permutation Hashing.
  In this paper, we propose to incorporate the essential ideas of C-MinHash to improve the accuracy of One Permutation Hashing. Basically, we develop a new densification method for OPH, which achieves the smallest estimation variance compared to all existing densification schemes for OPH. Our proposed method is named C-OPH (Circulant OPH). After the initial permutation (which breaks the existing structure of the data), C-OPH only needs a "shorter" permutation of length $D/K$ (instead of $D$), where $D$ is the original data dimension and $K$ is the total number of bins in OPH. This short permutation is re-used in $K$ bins in a circulant shifting manner. It can be shown that the estimation variance of the Jaccard similarity is strictly smaller than that of the existing (densified) OPH methods.

**Abstract:** A* is a classic and popular method for graphs search and path finding. It assumes the existence of a heuristic function $h(u,t)$ that estimates the shortest distance from any input node $u$ to the destination $t$. Traditionally, heuristics have been handcrafted by domain experts. However, over the last few years, there has been a growing interest in learning heuristic functions. Such learned heuristics estimate the distance between given nodes based on "features" of those nodes.
  In this paper we formalize and initiate the study of such feature-based heuristics. In particular, we consider heuristics induced by norm embeddings and distance labeling schemes, and provide lower bounds for the tradeoffs between the number of dimensions or bits used to represent each graph node, and the running time of the A* algorithm. We also show that, under natural assumptions, our lower bounds are almost optimal.

**Abstract:** Understanding the NAND flash memory channel has become more and more challenging due to the continually increasing density and the complex distortions arising from the write and read mechanisms. In this work, we propose a data-driven generative modeling method to characterize the flash memory channel. The learned model can reconstruct the read voltage from an individual memory cell based on the program levels of the cell and its surrounding array of cells. Experimental results show that the statistical distribution of the reconstructed read voltages accurately reflects the measured distribution on a commercial flash memory chip, both qualitatively and as quantified by the total variation distance. Moreover, we observe that the learned model can capture precise inter-cell interference (ICI) effects, as verified by comparison of the error probabilities of specific patterns in wordlines and bitlines.

**Abstract:** Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are often contaminated with artifacts. It is imperative to develop a practical and reliable artifact removal method to prevent misinterpretations of neural signals and underperformance of brain-computer interfaces. This study developed a new artifact removal method, IC-U-Net, which is based on the U-Net architecture for removing pervasive EEG artifacts and reconstructing brain sources. The IC-U-Net was trained using mixtures of brain and non-brain sources decomposed by independent component analysis and employed an ensemble of loss functions to model complex signal fluctuations in EEG recordings. The effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering brain sources and removing various artifacts (e.g., eye blinks/movements, muscle activities, and line/channel noises) was demonstrated in a simulation study and three real-world EEG datasets collected at rest and while driving and walking. IC-U-Net is user-friendly and publicly available, does not require parameter tuning or artifact type designations, and has no limitations on channel numbers. Given the increasing need to image natural brain dynamics in a mobile setting, IC-U-Net offers a promising end-to-end solution for automatically removing artifacts from EEG recordings.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a second-order extension of the continuous-time game-theoretic mirror descent (MD) dynamics, referred to as MD2, which converges to mere (but not necessarily strict) variationally stable states (VSS) without using common auxiliary techniques such as averaging or discounting. We show that MD2 enjoys no-regret as well as exponential rate of convergence towards a strong VSS upon a slight modification. Furthermore, MD2 can be used to derive many novel primal-space dynamics. Lastly, using stochastic approximation techniques, we provide a convergence guarantee of discrete-time MD2 with noisy observations towards interior mere VSS. Selected simulations are provided to illustrate our results.

**Abstract:** This paper addresses learning safe control laws from expert demonstrations. We assume that appropriate models of the system dynamics and the output measurement map are available, along with corresponding error bounds. We first propose robust output control barrier functions (ROCBFs) as a means to guarantee safety, as defined through controlled forward invariance of a safe set. We then present an optimization problem to learn ROCBFs from expert demonstrations that exhibit safe system behavior, e.g., data collected from a human operator. Along with the optimization problem, we provide verifiable conditions that guarantee validity of the obtained ROCBF. These conditions are stated in terms of the density of the data and on Lipschitz and boundedness constants of the learned function and the models of the system dynamics and the output measurement map. When the parametrization of the ROCBF is linear, then, under mild assumptions, the optimization problem is convex. We validate our findings in the autonomous driving simulator CARLA and show how to learn safe control laws from RGB camera images.

**Abstract:** Modern software deployment process produces software that is uniform and hence vulnerable to large-scale code-reuse attacks, such as Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) attacks. Compiler-based diversification improves the resilience of software systems by automatically generating different assembly code versions of a given program. Existing techniques are efficient but do not have a precise control over the quality of the generated variants. This paper introduces Diversity by Construction (DivCon), a constraint-based approach to software diversification. Unlike previous approaches, DivCon allows users to control and adjust the conflicting goals of diversity and code quality. A key enabler is the use of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) to generate highly diverse code efficiently. For larger problems, we propose a combination of LNS with a structural decomposition of the problem. To further improve the diversification efficiency of DivCon against JOP attacks, we propose an application-specific distance measure tailored to the characteristics of JOP attacks. We evaluate DivCon with 20 functions from a popular benchmark suite for embedded systems. These experiments show that the combination of LNS and our application-specific distance measure generates binary programs that are highly resilient against JOP attacks. Our results confirm that there is a trade-off between the quality of each assembly code version and the diversity of the entire pool of versions. In particular, the experiments show that DivCon generates near-optimal binary programs that share a small number of gadgets. For constraint programming researchers and practitioners, this paper demonstrates that LNS is a valuable technique for finding diverse solutions. For security researchers and software engineers, DivCon extends the scope of compiler-based diversification to performance-critical and resource-constrained applications.

**Abstract:** Real-world robotic tasks require complex reward functions. When we define the problem the robot needs to solve, we pretend that a designer specifies this complex reward exactly, and it is set in stone from then on. In practice, however, reward design is an iterative process: the designer chooses a reward, eventually encounters an "edge-case" environment where the reward incentivizes the wrong behavior, revises the reward, and repeats. What would it mean to rethink robotics problems to formally account for this iterative nature of reward design? We propose that the robot not take the specified reward for granted, but rather have uncertainty about it, and account for the future design iterations as future evidence. We contribute an Assisted Reward Design method that speeds up the design process by anticipating and influencing this future evidence: rather than letting the designer eventually encounter failure cases and revise the reward then, the method actively exposes the designer to such environments during the development phase. We test this method in a simplified autonomous driving task and find that it more quickly improves the car's behavior in held-out environments by proposing environments that are "edge cases" for the current reward.

**Abstract:** The aviation industry as well as the industries that benefit and are linked to it are ripe for innovation in the form of Big Data analytics. The number of available big data technologies is constantly growing, while at the same time the existing ones are rapidly evolving and empowered with new features. However, the Big Data era imposes the crucial challenge of how to effectively handle information security while managing massive and rapidly evolving data from heterogeneous data sources. While multiple technologies have emerged, there is a need to find a balance between multiple security requirements, privacy obligations, system performance and rapid dynamic analysis on large datasets. The current paper aims to introduce the ICARUS Secure Experimentation Sandbox of the ICARUS platform. The ICARUS platform aims to provide a big data-enabled platform that aspires to become an 'one-stop shop' for aviation data and intelligence marketplace that provides a trusted and secure 'sandboxed' analytics workspace, allowing the exploration, integration and deep analysis of original and derivative data in a trusted and fair manner. Towards this end, a Secure Experimentation Sandbox has been designed and integrated in the ICARUS platform offering, that enables the provisioning of a sophisticated environment that can completely guarantee the safety and confidentiality of data, allowing to any interested party to utilise the platform to conduct analytical experiments in closed-lab conditions.

**Abstract:** Robot navigation traditionally relies on building an explicit map that is used to plan collision-free trajectories to a desired target. In deformable, complex terrain, using geometric-based approaches can fail to find a path due to mischaracterizing deformable objects as rigid and impassable. Instead, we learn to predict an estimate of traversability of terrain regions and to prefer regions that are easier to navigate (e.g., short grass over small shrubs). Rather than predicting collisions, we instead regress on realized error compared to a canonical dynamics model. We train with an on-policy approach, resulting in successful navigation policies using as little as 50 minutes of training data split across simulation and real world. Our learning-based navigation system is a sample efficient short-term planner that we demonstrate on a Clearpath Husky navigating through a variety of terrain including grassland and forest

**Abstract:** The model order of a wireless channel plays an important role for a variety of applications in communications engineering, e.g., it represents the number of resolvable incident wavefronts with non-negligible power incident from a transmitter to a receiver. Areas such as direction of arrival estimation leverage the model order to analyze the multipath components of channel state information. In this work, we propose to use a variational autoencoder to group unlabeled channel state information with respect to the model order in the variational autoencoder latent space in an unsupervised manner. We validate our approach with simulated 3GPP channel data. Our results suggest that, in order to learn an appropriate clustering, it is crucial to use a more flexible likelihood model for the variational autoencoder decoder than it is usually the case in standard applications.

**Abstract:** Model transparency is a prerequisite in many domains and an increasingly popular area in machine learning research. In the medical domain, for instance, unveiling the mechanisms behind a disease often has higher priority than the diagnostic itself since it might dictate or guide potential treatments and research directions. One of the most popular approaches to explain model global predictions is the permutation importance where the performance on permuted data is benchmarked against the baseline. However, this method and other related approaches will undervalue the importance of a feature in the presence of covariates since these cover part of its provided information. To address this issue, we propose Covered Information Disentanglement (CID), a method that considers all feature information overlap to correct the values provided by permutation importance. We further show how to compute CID efficiently when coupled with Markov random fields. We demonstrate its efficacy in adjusting permutation importance first on a controlled toy dataset and discuss its effect on real-world medical data.

**Abstract:** The kepler and TESS missions have generated over 100,000 potential transit signals that must be processed in order to create a catalog of planet candidates. During the last few years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning to analyze these data in search of new exoplanets. Different from the existing machine learning works, ExoMiner, the proposed deep learning classifier in this work, mimics how domain experts examine diagnostic tests to vet a transit signal. ExoMiner is a highly accurate, explainable, and robust classifier that 1) allows us to validate 301 new exoplanets from the MAST Kepler Archive and 2) is general enough to be applied across missions such as the on-going TESS mission. We perform an extensive experimental study to verify that ExoMiner is more reliable and accurate than the existing transit signal classifiers in terms of different classification and ranking metrics. For example, for a fixed precision value of 99%, ExoMiner retrieves 93.6% of all exoplanets in the test set (i.e., recall=0.936) while this rate is 76.3% for the best existing classifier. Furthermore, the modular design of ExoMiner favors its explainability. We introduce a simple explainability framework that provides experts with feedback on why ExoMiner classifies a transit signal into a specific class label (e.g., planet candidate or not planet candidate).

**Abstract:** COVID-19 severity is due to complications from SARS-Cov-2 but the clinical course of the infection varies for individuals, emphasizing the need to better understand the disease at the molecular level. We use clinical and multiple molecular data (or views) obtained from patients with and without COVID-19 who were (or not) admitted to the intensive care unit to shed light on COVID-19 severity. Methods for jointly associating the views and separating the COVID-19 groups (i.e., one-step methods) have focused on linear relationships. The relationships between the views and COVID-19 patient groups, however, are too complex to be understood solely by linear methods. Existing nonlinear one-step methods cannot be used to identify signatures to aid in our understanding of the complexity of the disease. We propose Deep IDA (Integrative Discriminant Analysis) to address analytical challenges in our problem of interest. Deep IDA learns nonlinear projections of two or more views that maximally associate the views and separate the classes in each view, and permits feature ranking for interpretable findings. Our applications demonstrate that Deep IDA has competitive classification rates compared to other state-of-the-art methods and is able to identify molecular signatures that facilitate an understanding of COVID-19 severity.
