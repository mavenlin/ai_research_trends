**Abstract:** Information overload is a major obstacle to scientific progress. The explosive growth in scientific literature and data has made it ever harder to discover useful insights in a large mass of information. Today scientific knowledge is accessed through search engines, but they are unable to organize scientific knowledge alone. In this paper we introduce Galactica: a large language model that can store, combine and reason about scientific knowledge. We train on a large scientific corpus of papers, reference material, knowledge bases and many other sources. We outperform existing models on a range of scientific tasks. On technical knowledge probes such as LaTeX equations, Galactica outperforms the latest GPT-3 by 68.2% versus 49.0%. Galactica also performs well on reasoning, outperforming Chinchilla on mathematical MMLU by 41.3% to 35.7%, and PaLM 540B on MATH with a score of 20.4% versus 8.8%. It also sets a new state-of-the-art on downstream tasks such as PubMedQA and MedMCQA dev of 77.6% and 52.9%. And despite not being trained on a general corpus, Galactica outperforms BLOOM and OPT-175B on BIG-bench. We believe these results demonstrate the potential for language models as a new interface for science. We open source the model for the benefit of the scientific community.

**Abstract:** We propose Token Turing Machines (TTM), a sequential, autoregressive Transformer model with memory for real-world sequential visual understanding. Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which summarise the previous history (i.e., frames). This memory is efficiently addressed, read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each step. The model's memory module ensures that a new observation will only be processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks, on two real-world sequential visual understanding tasks: online temporal activity detection from videos and vision-based robot action policy learning.

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit. We intend for HELM to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.

**Abstract:** Quantum computing is a game-changing technology for global academia, research centers and industries including computational science, mathematics, finance, pharmaceutical, materials science, chemistry and cryptography. Although it has seen a major boost in the last decade, we are still a long way from reaching the maturity of a full-fledged quantum computer. That said, we will be in the Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for a long time, working on dozens or even thousands of qubits quantum computing systems. An outstanding challenge, then, is to come up with an application that can reliably carry out a nontrivial task of interest on the near-term quantum devices with non-negligible quantum noise. To address this challenge, several near-term quantum computing techniques, including variational quantum algorithms, error mitigation, quantum circuit compilation and benchmarking protocols, have been proposed to characterize and mitigate errors, and to implement algorithms with a certain resistance to noise, so as to enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum devices and explore the boundaries of their ability to realize useful applications. Besides, the development of near-term quantum devices is inseparable from the efficient classical simulation, which plays a vital role in quantum algorithm design and verification, error-tolerant verification and other applications. This review will provide a thorough introduction of these near-term quantum computing techniques, report on their progress, and finally discuss the future prospect of these techniques, which we hope will motivate researchers to undertake additional studies in this field.

**Abstract:** Auditing machine learning-based (ML) healthcare tools for bias is critical to preventing patient harm, especially in communities that disproportionately face health inequities. General frameworks are becoming increasingly available to measure ML fairness gaps between groups. However, ML for health (ML4H) auditing principles call for a contextual, patient-centered approach to model assessment. Therefore, ML auditing tools must be (1) better aligned with ML4H auditing principles and (2) able to illuminate and characterize communities vulnerable to the most harm. To address this gap, we propose supplementing ML4H auditing frameworks with SLOGAN (patient Severity-based LOcal Group biAs detectioN), an automatic tool for capturing local biases in a clinical prediction task. SLOGAN adapts an existing tool, LOGAN (LOcal Group biAs detectioN), by contextualizing group bias detection in patient illness severity and past medical history. We investigate and compare SLOGAN's bias detection capabilities to LOGAN and other clustering techniques across patient subgroups in the MIMIC-III dataset. On average, SLOGAN identifies larger fairness disparities in over 75% of patient groups than LOGAN while maintaining clustering quality. Furthermore, in a diabetes case study, health disparity literature corroborates the characterizations of the most biased clusters identified by SLOGAN. Our results contribute to the broader discussion of how machine learning biases may perpetuate existing healthcare disparities.

**Abstract:** Mobile robots extract information from its environment to understand their current situation to enable intelligent decision making and autonomous task execution. In our previous work, we introduced the concept of Situation Graphs (S-Graphs) which combines in a single optimizable graph, the robot keyframes and the representation of the environment with geometric, semantic and topological abstractions. Although S-Graphs were built and optimized in real-time and demonstrated state-of-the-art results, they are limited to specific structured environments with specific hand-tuned dimensions of rooms and corridors.
  In this work, we present an advanced version of the Situational Graphs (S-Graphs+), consisting of the five layered optimizable graph that includes (1) metric layer along with the graph of free-space clusters (2) keyframe layer where the robot poses are registered (3) metric-semantic layer consisting of the extracted planar walls (4) novel rooms layer constraining the extracted planar walls (5) novel floors layer encompassing the rooms within a given floor level. S-Graphs+ demonstrates improved performance over S-Graphs efficiently extracting the room information while simultaneously improving the pose estimate of the robot, thus extending the robots situational awareness in the form of a five layered environmental model.

**Abstract:** We consider the idealized setting of gradient flow on the population risk for infinitely wide two-layer ReLU neural networks (without bias), and study the effect of symmetries on the learned parameters and predictors. We first describe a general class of symmetries which, when satisfied by the target function $f^*$ and the input distribution, are preserved by the dynamics. We then study more specific cases. When $f^*$ is odd, we show that the dynamics of the predictor reduces to that of a (non-linearly parameterized) linear predictor, and its exponential convergence can be guaranteed. When $f^*$ has a low-dimensional structure, we prove that the gradient flow PDE reduces to a lower-dimensional PDE. Furthermore, we present informal and numerical arguments that suggest that the input neurons align with the lower-dimensional structure of the problem.

**Abstract:** The geometry of 4-string contact interaction of closed string field theory is characterized using machine learning. We obtain Strebel quadratic differentials on 4-punctured spheres as a neural network by performing unsupervised learning with a custom-built loss function. This allows us to solve for local coordinates and compute their associated mapping radii numerically. We also train a neural network distinguishing vertex from Feynman region. As a check, 4-tachyon contact term in the tachyon potential is computed and a good agreement with the results in the literature is observed. We argue that our algorithm is manifestly independent of number of punctures and scaling it to characterize the geometry of $n$-string contact interaction is feasible.

**Abstract:** Optimal Transport (OT) has recently emerged as a central tool in data sciences to compare in a geometrically faithful way point clouds and more generally probability distributions. The wide adoption of OT into existing data analysis and machine learning pipelines is however plagued by several shortcomings. This includes its lack of robustness to outliers, its high computational costs, the need for a large number of samples in high dimension and the difficulty to handle data in distinct spaces. In this review, we detail several recently proposed approaches to mitigate these issues. We insist in particular on unbalanced OT, which compares arbitrary positive measures, not restricted to probability distributions (i.e. their total mass can vary). This generalization of OT makes it robust to outliers and missing data. The second workhorse of modern computational OT is entropic regularization, which leads to scalable algorithms while lowering the sample complexity in high dimension. The last point presented in this review is the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, which extends OT to cope with distributions belonging to different metric spaces. The main motivation for this review is to explain how unbalanced OT, entropic regularization and GW can work hand-in-hand to turn OT into efficient geometric loss functions for data sciences.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to transform data analysis in many domains. Progress in each domain is driven by a growing body of annotated data, increased computational resources, and technological innovations. In medicine, the sensitivity of the data, the complexity of the tasks, the potentially high stakes, and a requirement of accountability give rise to a particular set of challenges. In this review, we focus on three key methodological approaches that address some of the particular challenges in AI-driven medical decision making. (1) Explainable AI aims to produce a human-interpretable justification for each output. Such models increase confidence if the results appear plausible and match the clinicians expectations. However, the absence of a plausible explanation does not imply an inaccurate model. Especially in highly non-linear, complex models that are tuned to maximize accuracy, such interpretable representations only reflect a small portion of the justification. (2) Domain adaptation and transfer learning enable AI models to be trained and applied across multiple domains. For example, a classification task based on images acquired on different acquisition hardware. (3) Federated learning enables learning large-scale models without exposing sensitive personal health information. Unlike centralized AI learning, where the centralized learning machine has access to the entire training data, the federated learning process iteratively updates models across multiple sites by exchanging only parameter updates, not personal health data. This narrative review covers the basic concepts, highlights relevant corner-stone and state-of-the-art research in the field, and discusses perspectives.

**Abstract:** With increasing interest in explaining machine learning (ML) models, the first part of this two-part study synthesizes recent research on methods for explaining global and local aspects of ML models. This study distinguishes explainability from interpretability, local from global explainability, and feature importance versus feature relevance. We demonstrate and visualize different explanation methods, how to interpret them, and provide a complete Python package (scikit-explain) to allow future researchers to explore these products. We also highlight the frequent disagreement between explanation methods for feature rankings and feature effects and provide practical advice for dealing with these disagreements. We used ML models developed for severe weather prediction and sub-freezing road surface temperature prediction to generalize the behavior of the different explanation methods. For feature rankings, there is substantially more agreement on the set of top features (e.g., on average, two methods agree on 6 of the top 10 features) than on specific rankings (on average, two methods only agree on the ranks of 2-3 features in the set of top 10 features). On the other hand, two feature effect curves from different methods are in high agreement as long as the phase space is well sampled. Finally, a lesser-known method, tree interpreter, was found comparable to SHAP for feature effects, and with the widespread use of random forests in geosciences and computational ease of tree interpreter, we recommend it be explored in future research.

**Abstract:** The study analyzes the impact of constant and alternating magnetic fields and alternating electric fields on various growth parameters of soy plants: the germination energy and capacity, plants emergence and number, the Yield(II) of the fresh mass of seedlings, protein content, and photosynthetic parameters. Four cultivars were used: MAVKA, MERLIN, VIOLETTA, and ANUSZKA. Moreover, the advanced Machine Learning processing pipeline was proposed to distinguish the impact of physical factors on photosynthetic parameters. It is possible to distinguish exposition on different physical factors for the first three cultivars; therefore, it indicates that the EM factors have some observable effect on soy plants. Moreover, some influence of physical factors on growth parameters was observed. The use of ELM (Electromagnetic) fields had a positive impact on the germination rate in Merlin plants. The highest values were recorded for the constant magnetic field (CMF) - Merlin, and the lowest for the alternating electric field (AEF) - Violetta. An increase in terms of emergence and number of plants after seed stimulation was observed for the Mavka cultivar, except for the AEF treatment (number of plants after 30 days) (...)

**Abstract:** Machine learning models have shone in a variety of domains and attracted increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One important yet worrying question is: will training models under the differential privacy (DP) constraint unfavorably impact on the adversarial robustness? While previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyperparameters for DP optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\% natural accuracy, 72\% robust accuracy ($+9\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$ attack, and 69\% robust accuracy ($+16\%$ than the non-private model) with pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with $Îµ=2$. In fact, we show both theoretically and empirically that DP models are Pareto optimal on the accuracy-robustness tradeoff. Empirically, the robustness of DP models is consistently observed on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CelebA datasets, with ResNet and Vision Transformer. We believe our encouraging results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well as robust.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted considerable attention in both academia and industry. Due to the lack of anomalous data in many practical cases, AD is usually solved by first modeling the normal data pattern and then determining if data fit this model. Generative models (GMs) seem a natural tool to achieve this purpose, which learn the normal data distribution and estimate it using a probability density function (PDF). However, some works have observed the ideal performance of such GM-based AD methods. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on the ideal performance of GM-based AD methods. We state that in these methods, the implicit assumption that connects GMs'results to AD's goal is usually implausible due to normal data's multi-peaked distribution characteristic, which is quite common in practical cases. We first qualitatively formulate this perspective, and then focus on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to intuitively illustrate the perspective, which is a typical GM and has the natural property to approximate multi-peaked distributions. Based on the proposed perspective, in order to bypass the implicit assumption in the GMM-based AD method, we suggest integrating the Discriminative idea to orient GMM to AD tasks (DiGMM). With DiGMM, we establish a connection of generative and discriminative models, which are two key paradigms for AD and are usually treated separately before. This connection provides a possible direction for future works to jointly consider the two paradigms and incorporate their complementary characteristics for AD.

**Abstract:** The development of generative Machine Learning (ML) models in creative practices, enabled by the recent improvements in usability and availability of pre-trained models, is raising more and more interest among artists, practitioners and performers. Yet, the introduction of such techniques in artistic domains also revealed multiple limitations that escape current evaluation methods used by scientists. Notably, most models are still unable to generate content that lay outside of the domain defined by the training dataset. In this paper, we propose an alternative prospective framework, starting from a new general formulation of ML objectives, that we derive to delineate possible implications and solutions that already exist in the ML literature (notably for the audio and musical domain). We also discuss existing relations between generative models and computational creativity and how our framework could help address the lack of creativity in existing models.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new method for mapping a 3D point cloud to the latent space of a 3D generative adversarial network. Our generative model for 3D point clouds is based on SP-GAN, a state-of-the-art sphere-guided 3D point cloud generator. We derive an efficient way to encode an input 3D point cloud to the latent space of the SP-GAN. Our point cloud encoder can resolve the point ordering issue during inversion, and thus can determine the correspondences between points in the generated 3D point cloud and those in the canonical sphere used by the generator. We show that our method outperforms previous GAN inversion methods for 3D point clouds, achieving state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p>

**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn generalizable representations for image, text, audio, video, etc., by reconstructing masked input data from tokens of the visible data. Current MAE approaches for videos rely on random patch, tube, or frame-based masking strategies to select these tokens. This paper proposes AdaMAE, an adaptive masking strategy for MAEs that is end-to-end trainable. Our adaptive masking strategy samples visible tokens based on the semantic context using an auxiliary sampling network. This network estimates a categorical distribution over spacetime-patch tokens. The tokens that increase the expected reconstruction error are rewarded and selected as visible tokens, motivated by the policy gradient algorithm in reinforcement learning. We show that AdaMAE samples more tokens from the high spatiotemporal information regions, thereby allowing us to mask 95% of tokens, resulting in lower memory requirements and faster pre-training. We conduct ablation studies on the Something-Something v2 (SSv2) dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of our adaptive sampling approach and report state-of-the-art results of 70.0% and 81.7% in top-1 accuracy on SSv2 and Kinetics-400 action classification datasets with a ViT-Base backbone and 800 pre-training epochs.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a method to partially mimic natural intelligence for the problem of lifelong learning representations that are compatible. We take the perspective of a learning agent that is interested in recognizing object instances in an open dynamic universe in a way in which any update to its internal feature representation does not render the features in the gallery unusable for visual search. We refer to this learning problem as Compatible Lifelong Learning Representations (CL2R) as it considers compatible representation learning within the lifelong learning paradigm. We identify stationarity as the property that the feature representation is required to hold to achieve compatibility and propose a novel training procedure that encourages local and global stationarity on the learned representation. Due to stationarity, the statistical properties of the learned features do not change over time, making them interoperable with previously learned features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that our CL2R training procedure outperforms alternative baselines and state-of-the-art methods. We also provide novel metrics to specifically evaluate compatible representation learning under catastrophic forgetting in various sequential learning tasks.

**Abstract:** Observing a human demonstrator manipulate objects provides a rich, scalable and inexpensive source of data for learning robotic policies. However, transferring skills from human videos to a robotic manipulator poses several challenges, not least a difference in action and observation spaces. In this work, we use unlabeled videos of humans solving a wide range of manipulation tasks to learn a task-agnostic reward function for robotic manipulation policies. Thanks to the diversity of this training data, the learned reward function sufficiently generalizes to image observations from a previously unseen robot embodiment and environment to provide a meaningful prior for directed exploration in reinforcement learning. The learned rewards are based on distances to a goal in an embedding space learned using a time-contrastive objective. By conditioning the function on a goal image, we are able to reuse one model across a variety of tasks. Unlike prior work on leveraging human videos to teach robots, our method, Human Offline Learned Distances (HOLD) requires neither a priori data from the robot environment, nor a set of task-specific human demonstrations, nor a predefined notion of correspondence across morphologies, yet it is able to accelerate training of several manipulation tasks on a simulated robot arm compared to using only a sparse reward obtained from task completion.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors (ODs) have been studied extensively in the past few years. These attacks cause the model to make incorrect predictions by placing a patch containing an adversarial pattern on the target object or anywhere within the frame. However, none of prior research proposed a misclassification attack on ODs, in which the patch is applied on the target object. In this study, we propose a novel, universal, targeted, label-switch attack against the state-of-the-art object detector, YOLO. In our attack, we use (i) a tailored projection function to enable the placement of the adversarial patch on multiple target objects in the image (e.g., cars), each of which may be located a different distance away from the camera or have a different view angle relative to the camera, and (ii) a unique loss function capable of changing the label of the attacked objects. The proposed universal patch, which is trained in the digital domain, is transferable to the physical domain. We performed an extensive evaluation using different types of object detectors, different video streams captured by different cameras, and various target classes, and evaluated different configurations of the adversarial patch in the physical domain.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose the task of consecutive question generation (CQG), which generates a set of logically related question-answer pairs to understand a whole passage, with a comprehensive consideration of the aspects including accuracy, coverage, and informativeness. To achieve this, we first examine the four key elements of CQG, i.e., question, answer, rationale, and context history, and propose a novel dynamic multitask framework with one main task generating a question-answer pair, and four auxiliary tasks generating other elements. It directly helps the model generate good questions through both joint training and self-reranking. At the same time, to fully explore the worth-asking information in a given passage, we make use of the reranking losses to sample the rationales and search for the best question series globally. Finally, we measure our strategy by QA data augmentation and manual evaluation, as well as a novel application of generated question-answer pairs on DocNLI. We prove that our strategy can improve question generation significantly and benefit multiple related NLP tasks.

**Abstract:** Developing interactive software, such as websites or games, is a particularly engaging way to learn computer science. However, teaching and giving feedback on such software is time-consuming -- standard approaches require instructors to manually grade student-implemented interactive programs. As a result, online platforms that serve millions, like Code.org, are unable to provide any feedback on assignments for implementing interactive programs, which critically hinders students' ability to learn. One approach toward automatic grading is to learn an agent that interacts with a student's program and explores states indicative of errors via reinforcement learning. However, existing work on this approach only provides binary feedback of whether a program is correct or not, while students require finer-grained feedback on the specific errors in their programs to understand their mistakes. In this work, we show that exploring to discover errors can be cast as a meta-exploration problem. This enables us to construct a principled objective for discovering errors and an algorithm for optimizing this objective, which provides fine-grained feedback. We evaluate our approach on a set of over 700K real anonymized student programs from a Code.org interactive assignment. Our approach provides feedback with 94.3% accuracy, improving over existing approaches by 17.7% and coming within 1.5% of human-level accuracy. Project web page: https://ezliu.github.io/dreamgrader.

**Abstract:** Conditional imitation learning (CIL) trains deep neural networks, in an end-to-end manner, to mimic human driving. This approach has demonstrated suitable vehicle control when following roads, avoiding obstacles, or taking specific turns at intersections to reach a destination. Unfortunately, performance dramatically decreases when deployed to unseen environments and is inconsistent against varying weather conditions. Most importantly, the current CIL fails to avoid static road blockages. In this work, we propose a solution to those deficiencies. First, we fuse the laser scanner with the regular camera streams, at the features level, to overcome the generalization and consistency challenges. Second, we introduce a new efficient Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) method along with new algorithms for road blockages avoidance and global route planning. Consequently, our proposed method dynamically detects partial and full road blockages, and guides the controlled vehicle to another route to reach the destination. Following the original CIL work, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposal on CARLA simulator urban driving benchmark. Our experiments showed that our model improved consistency against weather conditions by four times and autonomous driving success rate generalization by 52%. Furthermore, our global route planner improved the driving success rate by 37%. Our proposed road blockages avoidance algorithm improved the driving success rate by 27%. Finally, the average kilometers traveled before a collision with a static object increased by 1.5 times.

**Abstract:** Compared to query-based black-box attacks, transfer-based black-box attacks do not require any information of the attacked models, which ensures their secrecy. However, most existing transfer-based approaches rely on ensembling multiple models to boost the attack transferability, which is time- and resource-intensive, not to mention the difficulty of obtaining diverse models on the same task. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on the single-model transfer-based black-box attack on object detection, utilizing only one model to achieve a high-transferability adversarial attack on multiple black-box detectors. Specifically, we first make observations on the patch optimization process of the existing method and propose an enhanced attack framework by slightly adjusting its training strategies. Then, we analogize patch optimization with regular model optimization, proposing a series of self-ensemble approaches on the input data, the attacked model, and the adversarial patch to efficiently make use of the limited information and prevent the patch from overfitting. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can be applied with multiple classical base attack methods (e.g., PGD and MIM) to greatly improve the black-box transferability of the well-optimized patch on multiple mainstream detectors, meanwhile boosting white-box performance.

**Abstract:** Human communication relies on common ground (CG), the mutual knowledge and beliefs shared by participants, to produce coherent and interesting conversations. In this paper, we demonstrate that current response generation (RG) models produce generic and dull responses in dialogues because they act reflexively, failing to explicitly model CG, both due to the lack of CG in training data and the standard RG training procedure. We introduce Reflect, a dataset that annotates dialogues with explicit CG (materialized as inferences approximating shared knowledge and beliefs) and solicits 9k diverse human-generated responses each following one common ground. Using Reflect, we showcase the limitations of current dialogue data and RG models: less than half of the responses in current data are rated as high quality (sensible, specific, and interesting) and models trained using this data have even lower quality, while most Reflect responses are judged high quality. Next, we analyze whether CG can help models produce better-quality responses by using Reflect CG to guide RG models. Surprisingly, we find that simply prompting GPT3 to "think" about CG generates 30% more quality responses, showing promising benefits to integrating CG into the RG process.

**Abstract:** Missing data is common in applied data science, particularly for tabular data sets found in healthcare, social sciences, and natural sciences. Most supervised learning methods work only on complete data, thus requiring preprocessing, such as missing value imputation, to work on incomplete data sets. However, imputation discards potentially useful information encoded by the pattern of missing values. For data sets with informative missing patterns, the Missing Indicator Method (MIM), which adds indicator variables to indicate the missing pattern, can be used in conjunction with imputation to improve model performance. We show experimentally that MIM improves performance for informative missing values, and we prove that MIM does not hurt linear models asymptotically for uninformative missing values. Nonetheless, MIM can increase variance if many of the added indicators are uninformative, causing harm particularly for high-dimensional data sets. To address this issue, we introduce Selective MIM (SMIM), a method that adds missing indicators only for features that have informative missing patterns. We show empirically that SMIM performs at least as well as MIM across a range of experimental settings, and improves MIM for high-dimensional data.

**Abstract:** While Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) has seen a tremendous advancement in the last few years, new applications and implementation scenarios present novel challenges and opportunities. These range from leveraging the conversational context, speaker and emotion dynamics modelling, to interpreting common sense expressions, informal language and sarcasm, addressing challenges of real time ERC and recognizing emotion causes. This survey starts by introducing ERC, elaborating on the challenges and opportunities pertaining to this task. It proceeds with a description of the main emotion taxonomies and methods to deal with subjectivity in annotations. It then describes Deep Learning methods relevant for ERC, word embeddings, and elaborates on the use of performance metrics for the task and methods to deal with the typically unbalanced ERC datasets. This is followed by a description and benchmark of key ERC works along with comprehensive tables comparing several works regarding their methods and performance across different datasets. The survey highlights the advantage of leveraging techniques to address unbalanced data, the exploration of mixed emotions and the benefits of incorporating annotation subjectivity in the learning phase.

**Abstract:** In some neural networks, individual neurons correspond to natural ``features'' in the input. Such \emph{monosemantic} neurons are of great help in interpretability studies, as they can be cleanly understood. In this work we report preliminary attempts to engineer monosemanticity in toy models. We find that models can be made more monosemantic without increasing the loss by just changing which local minimum the training process finds. More monosemantic loss minima have moderate negative biases, and we are able to use this fact to engineer highly monosemantic models. We are able to mechanistically interpret these models, including the residual polysemantic neurons, and uncover a simple yet surprising algorithm. Finally, we find that providing models with more neurons per layer makes the models more monosemantic, albeit at increased computational cost. These findings point to a number of new questions and avenues for engineering monosemanticity, which we intend to study these in future work.

**Abstract:** Machine learning approaches now achieve impressive generation capabilities in numerous domains such as image, audio or video. However, most training \& evaluation frameworks revolve around the idea of strictly modelling the original data distribution rather than trying to extrapolate from it. This precludes the ability of such models to diverge from the original distribution and, hence, exhibit some creative traits. In this paper, we propose various perspectives on how this complicated goal could ever be achieved, and provide preliminary results on our novel training objective called \textit{Bounded Adversarial Divergence} (BAD).

**Abstract:** Due to the huge amount of parameters, fine-tuning of pretrained language models (PLMs) is prone to overfitting in the low resource scenarios. In this work, we present a novel method that operates on the hidden representations of a PLM to reduce overfitting. During fine-tuning, our method inserts random autoencoders between the hidden layers of a PLM, which transform activations from the previous layers into a multi-view compressed representation before feeding it into the upper layers. The autoencoders are plugged out after fine-tuning, so our method does not add extra parameters or increase computation cost during inference. Our method demonstrates promising performance improvement across a wide range of sequence- and token-level low-resource NLP tasks.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly effective at tackling many real-world tasks. However, their wide adoption in mission-critical contexts is hampered by two major weaknesses - their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and their opaqueness. The former raises concerns about the security and generalization of DNNs in real-world conditions, whereas the latter impedes users' trust in their output. In this research, we (1) examine the effect of adversarial robustness on interpretability and (2) present a novel approach for improving the interpretability of DNNs that is based on regularization of neural activation sensitivity. We evaluate the interpretability of models trained using our method to that of standard models and models trained using state-of-the-art adversarial robustness techniques. Our results show that adversarially robust models are superior to standard models and that models trained using our proposed method are even better than adversarially robust models in terms of interpretability.

<p>

**Abstract:** In many learning theory problems, a central role is played by a hypothesis class: we might assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in the class (usually referred to as the realizable setting), or we might evaluate the learned model by comparing it with the best hypothesis in the class (the agnostic setting).
  Taking a step beyond these classic setups that involve only a single hypothesis class, we introduce comparative learning as a combination of the realizable and agnostic settings in PAC learning: given two binary hypothesis classes $S$ and $B$, we assume that the data is labeled according to a hypothesis in the source class $S$ and require the learned model to achieve an accuracy comparable to the best hypothesis in the benchmark class $B$. Even when both $S$ and $B$ have infinite VC dimensions, comparative learning can still have a small sample complexity. We show that the sample complexity of comparative learning is characterized by the mutual VC dimension $\mathsf{VC}(S,B)$ which we define to be the maximum size of a subset shattered by both $S$ and $B$. We also show a similar result in the online setting, where we give a regret characterization in terms of the mutual Littlestone dimension $\mathsf{Ldim}(S,B)$. These results also hold for partial hypotheses.
  We additionally show that the insights necessary to characterize the sample complexity of comparative learning can be applied to characterize the sample complexity of realizable multiaccuracy and multicalibration using the mutual fat-shattering dimension, an analogue of the mutual VC dimension for real-valued hypotheses. This not only solves an open problem proposed by Hu, Peale, Reingold (2022), but also leads to independently interesting results extending classic ones about regression, boosting, and covering number to our two-hypothesis-class setting.

**Abstract:** Graph autoencoders (GAE) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) emerged as powerful methods for link prediction (LP). Their performances are less impressive on community detection (CD), where they are often outperformed by simpler alternatives such as the Louvain method. It is still unclear to what extent one can improve CD with GAE and VGAE, especially in the absence of node features. It is moreover uncertain whether one could do so while simultaneously preserving good performances on LP in a multi-task setting. In this workshop paper, summarizing results from our journal publication (Salha-Galvan et al. 2022), we show that jointly addressing these two tasks with high accuracy is possible. For this purpose, we introduce a community-preserving message passing scheme, doping our GAE and VGAE encoders by considering both the initial graph and Louvain-based prior communities when computing embedding spaces. Inspired by modularity-based clustering, we further propose novel training and optimization strategies specifically designed for joint LP and CD. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach, referred to as Modularity-Aware GAE and VGAE, on various real-world graphs.

**Abstract:** We propose and analyse a reduced-rank method for solving least-squares regression problems with infinite dimensional output. We derive learning bounds for our method, and study under which setting statistical performance is improved in comparison to full-rank method. Our analysis extends the interest of reduced-rank regression beyond the standard low-rank setting to more general output regularity assumptions. We illustrate our theoretical insights on synthetic least-squares problems. Then, we propose a surrogate structured prediction method derived from this reduced-rank method. We assess its benefits on three different problems: image reconstruction, multi-label classification, and metabolite identification.

**Abstract:** Stochastic restoration algorithms allow to explore the space of solutions that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic. Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability. These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.

**Abstract:** Text Simplification (TS) is the task of converting a text into a form that is easier to read while maintaining the meaning of the original text. A sub-task of TS is Cognitive Simplification (CS), converting text to a form that is readily understood by people with cognitive disabilities without rendering it childish or simplistic. This sub-task has yet to be explored with neural methods in NLP, and resources for it are scarcely available. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating knowledge from the cognitive accessibility domain into a TS model, by introducing an inductive bias regarding what simplification operations to use. We show that by adding this inductive bias to a TS-trained model, it is able to adapt better to CS without ever seeing CS data, and outperform a baseline model on a traditional TS benchmark. In addition, we provide a novel test dataset for CS, and analyze the differences between CS corpora and existing TS corpora, in terms of how simplification operations are applied.

**Abstract:** Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) is a task to detect and correct spelling mistakes in texts. In fact, most of Chinese input is based on pinyin input method, so the study of spelling errors in this process is more practical and valuable. However, there is still no research dedicated to this essential scenario. In this paper, we first present a Chinese Spelling Correction Dataset for errors generated by pinyin IME (CSCD-IME), including 40,000 annotated sentences from real posts of official media on Sina Weibo. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to automatically construct large-scale and high-quality pseudo data by simulating the input through pinyin IME. A series of analyses and experiments on CSCD-IME show that spelling errors produced by pinyin IME hold a particular distribution at pinyin level and semantic level and are challenging enough. Meanwhile, our proposed pseudo-data construction method can better fit this error distribution and improve the performance of CSC systems. Finally, we also provide a useful guide to using pseudo data, including the data scale, the data source, and the training strategy

**Abstract:** Keyword spotting (KWS) has been widely used in various speech control scenarios. The training of KWS is usually based on deep neural networks and requires a large amount of data. Manufacturers often use third-party data to train KWS. However, deep neural networks are not sufficiently interpretable to manufacturers, and attackers can manipulate third-party training data to plant backdoors during the model training. An effective backdoor attack can force the model to make specified judgments under certain conditions, i.e., triggers. In this paper, we design a backdoor attack scheme based on Pitch Boosting and Sound Masking for KWS, called PBSM. Experimental results demonstrated that PBSM is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 90% in three victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.

**Abstract:** Variable selection problem for the nonlinear Cox regression model is considered. In survival analysis, one main objective is to identify the covariates that are associated with the risk of experiencing the event of interest. The Cox proportional hazard model is being used extensively in survival analysis in studying the relationship between survival times and covariates, where the model assumes that the covariate has a log-linear effect on the hazard function. However, this linearity assumption may not be satisfied in practice. In order to extract a representative subset of features, various variable selection approaches have been proposed for survival data under the linear Cox model. However, there exists little literature on variable selection for the nonlinear Cox model. To break this gap, we extend the recently developed deep learning-based variable selection model LassoNet to survival data. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to analyze a real data set on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

**Abstract:** Matrix completion is a class of machine learning methods that concerns the prediction of missing entries in a partially observed matrix. This paper studies matrix completion for mixed data, i.e., data involving mixed types of variables (e.g., continuous, binary, ordinal). We formulate it as a low-rank matrix estimation problem under a general family of non-linear factor models and then propose entrywise consistent estimators for estimating the low-rank matrix. Tight probabilistic error bounds are derived for the proposed estimators. The proposed methods are evaluated by simulation studies and real-data applications for collaborative filtering and large-scale educational assessment.

**Abstract:** Online forums that allow for participatory engagement between users have been transformative for the public discussion of many important issues. However, such conversations can sometimes escalate into full-blown exchanges of hate and misinformation. Existing approaches in natural language processing (NLP), such as deep learning models for classification tasks, use as inputs only a single comment or a pair of comments depending upon whether the task concerns the inference of properties of the individual comments or the replies between pairs of comments, respectively. But in online conversations, comments and replies may be based on external context beyond the immediately relevant information that is input to the model. Therefore, being aware of the conversations' surrounding contexts should improve the model's performance for the inference task at hand.
  We propose GraphNLI, a novel graph-based deep learning architecture that uses graph walks to incorporate the wider context of a conversation in a principled manner. Specifically, a graph walk starts from a given comment and samples "nearby" comments in the same or parallel conversation threads, which results in additional embeddings that are aggregated together with the initial comment's embedding. We then use these enriched embeddings for downstream NLP prediction tasks that are important for online conversations. We evaluate GraphNLI on two such tasks - polarity prediction and misogynistic hate speech detection - and found that our model consistently outperforms all relevant baselines for both tasks. Specifically, GraphNLI with a biased root-seeking random walk performs with a macro-F1 score of 3 and 6 percentage points better than the best-performing BERT-based baselines for the polarity prediction and hate speech detection tasks, respectively.

**Abstract:** In practical applications, multi-view data depicting objectives from assorted perspectives can facilitate the accuracy increase of learning algorithms. However, given multi-view data, there is limited work for learning discriminative node relationships and graph information simultaneously via graph convolutional network that has drawn the attention from considerable researchers in recent years. Most of existing methods only consider the weighted sum of adjacency matrices, yet a joint neural network of both feature and graph fusion is still under-explored. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a joint deep learning framework called Learnable Graph Convolutional Network and Feature Fusion (LGCN-FF), consisting of two stages: feature fusion network and learnable graph convolutional network. The former aims to learn an underlying feature representation from heterogeneous views, while the latter explores a more discriminative graph fusion via learnable weights and a parametric activation function dubbed Differentiable Shrinkage Activation (DSA) function. The proposed LGCN-FF is validated to be superior to various state-of-the-art methods in multi-view semi-supervised classification.

**Abstract:** Systems engineering, in particular in the automotive domain, needs to cope with the massively increasing numbers of requirements that arise during the development process. To guarantee a high product quality and make sure that functional safety standards such as ISO26262 are fulfilled, the exploitation of potentials of model-driven systems engineering in the form of automatic analyses, consistency checks, and tracing mechanisms is indispensable. However, the language in which requirements are written, and the tools needed to operate on them, are highly individual and require domain-specific tailoring. This hinders automated processing of requirements as well as the linking of requirements to models. Introducing formal requirement notations in existing projects leads to the challenge of translating masses of requirements and process changes on the one hand and to the necessity of the corresponding training for the requirements engineers.
  In this paper, based on the analysis of an open-source set of automotive requirements, we derive domain-specific language constructs helping us to avoid ambiguities in requirements and increase the level of formality. The main contribution is the adoption and evaluation of few-shot learning with large pretrained language models for the automated translation of informal requirements to structured languages such as a requirement DSL. We show that support sets of less than ten translation examples can suffice to few-shot train a language model to incorporate keywords and implement syntactic rules into informal natural language requirements.

**Abstract:** The assessment and valuation of real estate requires large datasets with real estate information. Unfortunately, real estate databases are usually sparse in practice, i.e., not for each property every important attribute is available. In this paper, we study the potential of predicting high-level real estate attributes from visual data, specifically from two visual modalities, namely indoor (interior) and outdoor (facade) photos. We design three models using different multimodal fusion strategies and evaluate them for three different use cases. Thereby, a particular challenge is to handle missing modalities. We evaluate different fusion strategies, present baselines for the different prediction tasks, and find that enriching the training data with additional incomplete samples can lead to an improvement in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the fusion of information from indoor and outdoor photos results in a performance boost of up to 5% in Macro F1-score.

**Abstract:** Finding equilibria via gradient play in competitive multi-agent games has been attracting a growing amount of attention in recent years, with emphasis on designing efficient strategies where the agents operate in a decentralized and symmetric manner with guaranteed convergence. While significant efforts have been made in understanding zero-sum two-player matrix games, the performance in zero-sum multi-agent games remains inadequately explored, especially in the presence of delayed feedbacks, leaving the scalability and resiliency of gradient play open to questions.
  In this paper, we make progress by studying asynchronous gradient plays in zero-sum polymatrix games under delayed feedbacks. We first establish that the last iterate of entropy-regularized optimistic multiplicative weight updates (OMWU) method converges linearly to the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), the solution concept under bounded rationality, in the absence of delays. While the linear convergence continues to hold even when the feedbacks are randomly delayed under mild statistical assumptions, it converges at a noticeably slower rate due to a smaller tolerable range of learning rates. Moving beyond, we demonstrate entropy-regularized OMWU -- by adopting two-timescale learning rates in a delay-aware manner -- enjoys faster last-iterate convergence under fixed delays, and continues to converge provably even when the delays are arbitrarily bounded in an average-iterate manner. Our methods also lead to finite-time guarantees to approximate the Nash equilibrium (NE) by moderating the amount of regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that aims to understand asynchronous gradient play in zero-sum polymatrix games under a wide range of delay assumptions, highlighting the role of learning rates separation.

**Abstract:** In multichannel speech enhancement, both spectral and spatial information are vital for discriminating between speech and noise. How to fully exploit these two types of information and their temporal dynamics remains an interesting research problem. As a solution to this problem, this paper proposes a multi-cue fusion network named McNet, which cascades four modules to respectively exploit the full-band spatial, narrow-band spatial, sub-band spectral, and full-band spectral information. Experiments show that each module in the proposed network has its unique contribution and, as a whole, notably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Currently, the performance of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems is mainly constrained by the absence of large-scale labelled corpora. Data augmentation is regarded as a promising approach, which borrows methods from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), for instance, perturbation on speed and pitch, or generating emotional speech utilizing generative adversarial networks. In this paper, we propose EmoAug, a novel style transfer model to augment emotion expressions, in which a semantic encoder and a paralinguistic encoder represent verbal and non-verbal information respectively. Additionally, a decoder reconstructs speech signals by conditioning on the aforementioned two information flows in an unsupervised fashion. Once training is completed, EmoAug enriches expressions of emotional speech in different prosodic attributes, such as stress, rhythm and intensity, by feeding different styles into the paralinguistic encoder. In addition, we can also generate similar numbers of samples for each class to tackle the data imbalance issue. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that EmoAug can successfully transfer different speaking styles while retaining the speaker identity and semantic content. Furthermore, we train a SER model with data augmented by EmoAug and show that it not only surpasses the state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods but also overcomes overfitting problems caused by data imbalance. Some audio samples can be found on our demo website.

**Abstract:** A major challenge in medical image analysis is the automated detection of biomarkers from neuroimaging data. Traditional approaches, often based on image registration, are limited in capturing the high variability of cortical organisation across individuals. Deep learning methods have been shown to be successful in overcoming this difficulty, and some of them have even outperformed medical professionals on certain datasets. In this paper, we apply a deep neural network to analyse the cortical surface data of neonates, derived from the publicly available Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Our goal is to identify neurodevelopmental biomarkers and to predict gestational age at birth based on these biomarkers. Using scans of preterm neonates acquired around the term-equivalent age, we were able to investigate the impact of preterm birth on cortical growth and maturation during late gestation. Besides reaching state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, the proposed model has much fewer parameters than the baselines, and its error stays low on both unregistered and registered cortical surfaces.

**Abstract:** Deep learning techniques for gravitational-wave parameter estimation have emerged as a fast alternative to standard samplers $\unicode{x2013}$ producing results of comparable accuracy. These approaches (e.g., DINGO) enable amortized inference by training a normalizing flow to represent the Bayesian posterior conditional on observed data. By conditioning also on the noise power spectral density (PSD) they can even account for changing detector characteristics. However, training such networks requires knowing in advance the distribution of PSDs expected to be observed, and therefore can only take place once all data to be analyzed have been gathered. Here, we develop a probabilistic model to forecast future PSDs, greatly increasing the temporal scope of DINGO networks. Using PSDs from the second LIGO-Virgo observing run (O2) $\unicode{x2013}$ plus just a single PSD from the beginning of the third (O3) $\unicode{x2013}$ we show that we can train a DINGO network to perform accurate inference throughout O3 (on 37 real events). We therefore expect this approach to be a key component to enable the use of deep learning techniques for low-latency analyses of gravitational waves.

**Abstract:** Multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an indispensable tool in the clinic. Consequently, automatic volume-of-interest segmentation based on multi-parametric MR imaging is crucial for computer-aided disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis monitoring. Despite the extensive studies conducted in deep learning-based medical image analysis, further investigations are still required to effectively exploit the information provided by different imaging parameters. How to fuse the information is a key question in this field. Here, we propose an uncertainty-aware multi-parametric MR image feature fusion method to fully exploit the information for enhanced 3D image segmentation. Uncertainties in the independent predictions of individual modalities are utilized to guide the fusion of multi-modal image features. Extensive experiments on two datasets, one for brain tissue segmentation and the other for abdominal multi-organ segmentation, have been conducted, and our proposed method achieves better segmentation performance when compared to existing models.

**Abstract:** With the emerge of the Internet of Things (IoT), localization within indoor environments has become inevitable and has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. Several efforts have been made to cope with the challenges of accurate positioning systems in the presence of signal interference. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach through Gradient Boosting Enhanced with Step-Wise Feature Augmentation using Artificial Neural Network (AugBoost-ANN) for indoor localization applications as it trains over labeled data. For this purpose, we propose an IoT architecture using a star network topology to collect the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules by means of a Raspberry Pi as an Access Point (AP) in an indoor environment. The dataset for the experiments is gathered in the real world in different periods to match the real environments. Next, we address the challenges of the AugBoost-ANN training which augments features in each iteration of making a decision tree using a deep neural network and the transfer learning technique. Experimental results show more than 8\% improvement in terms of accuracy in comparison with the existing gradient boosting and deep learning methods recently proposed in the literature, and our proposed model acquires a mean location accuracy of 0.77 m.

**Abstract:** Nonlinear dimensionality reduction lacks interpretability due to the absence of source features in low-dimensional embedding space. We propose an interpretable method featMAP to preserve source features by tangent space embedding. The core of our proposal is to utilize local singular value decomposition (SVD) to approximate the tangent space which is embedded to low-dimensional space by maintaining the alignment. Based on the embedding tangent space, featMAP enables the interpretability by locally demonstrating the source features and feature importance. Furthermore, featMAP embeds the data points by anisotropic projection to preserve the local similarity and original density. We apply featMAP to interpreting digit classification, object detection and MNIST adversarial examples. FeatMAP uses source features to explicitly distinguish the digits and objects and to explain the misclassification of adversarial examples. We also compare featMAP with other state-of-the-art methods on local and global metrics.

**Abstract:** Question answering is one of the most challenging tasks in language understanding. Most approaches are developed for English, while less-resourced languages are much less researched. We adapt a successful English question-answering approach, called UnifiedQA, to the less-resourced Slovene language. Our adaptation uses the encoder-decoder transformer SloT5 and mT5 models to handle four question-answering formats: yes/no, multiple-choice, abstractive, and extractive. We use existing Slovene adaptations of four datasets, and machine translate the MCTest dataset. We show that a general model can answer questions in different formats at least as well as specialized models. The results are further improved using cross-lingual transfer from English. While we produce state-of-the-art results for Slovene, the performance still lags behind English.

**Abstract:** The vehicle recognition area, including vehicle make-model recognition (VMMR), re-id, tracking, and parts-detection, has made significant progress in recent years, driven by several large-scale datasets for each task. These datasets are often non-overlapping, with different label schemas for each task: VMMR focuses on make and model, while re-id focuses on vehicle ID. It is promising to combine these datasets to take advantage of knowledge across datasets as well as increased training data; however, dataset integration is challenging due to the domain gap problem. This paper proposes ATEAM, an annotation team-of-experts to perform cross-dataset labeling and integration of disjoint annotation schemas. ATEAM uses diverse experts, each trained on datasets that contain an annotation schema, to transfer knowledge to datasets without that annotation. Using ATEAM, we integrated several common vehicle recognition datasets into a Knowledge Integrated Dataset (KID). We evaluate ATEAM and KID for vehicle recognition problems and show that our integrated dataset can help off-the-shelf models achieve excellent accuracy on VMMR and vehicle re-id with no changes to model architectures. We achieve mAP of 0.83 on VeRi, and accuracy of 0.97 on CompCars. We have released both the dataset and the ATEAM framework for public use.

**Abstract:** Recent studies on Next-basket Recommendation (NBR) have achieved much progress by leveraging Personalized Item Frequency (PIF) as one of the main features, which measures the frequency of the user's interactions with the item. However, taking the PIF as an explicit feature incurs bias towards frequent items. Items that a user purchases frequently are assigned higher weights in the PIF-based recommender system and appear more frequently in the personalized recommendation list. As a result, the system will lose the fairness and balance between items that the user frequently purchases and items that the user never purchases. We refer to this systematic bias on personalized recommendation lists as frequency bias, which narrows users' browsing scope and reduces the system utility. We adopt causal inference theory to address this issue. Considering the influence of historical purchases on users' future interests, the user and item representations can be viewed as unobserved confounders in the causal diagram. In this paper, we propose a deconfounder model named FENDER (Frequency-aware Deconfounder for Next-basket Recommendation) to mitigate the frequency bias. With the deconfounder theory and the causal diagram we propose, FENDER decomposes PIF with a neural tensor layer to obtain substitute confounders for users and items. Then, FENDER performs unbiased recommendations considering the effect of these substitute confounders. Experimental results demonstrate that FENDER has derived diverse and fair results compared to ten baseline models on three datasets while achieving competitive performance. Further experiments illustrate how FENDER balances users' historical purchases and potential interests.

**Abstract:** Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) of TAIGA astrophysical complex allow to observe high energy gamma radiation helping to study many astrophysical objects and processes. TAIGA-IACT enables us to select gamma quanta from the total cosmic radiation flux and recover their primary parameters, such as energy and direction of arrival. The traditional method of processing the resulting images is an image parameterization - so-called the Hillas parameters method. At the present time Machine Learning methods, in particular Deep Learning methods have become actively used for IACT image processing. This paper presents the analysis of simulated Monte Carlo images by several Deep Learning methods for a single telescope (mono-mode) and multiple IACT telescopes (stereo-mode). The estimation of the quality of energy reconstruction was carried out and their energy spectra were analyzed using several types of neural networks. Using the developed methods the obtained results were also compared with the results obtained by traditional methods based on the Hillas parameters.

**Abstract:** For bike sharing systems, demand prediction is crucial to ensure the timely re-balancing of available bikes according to predicted demand. Existing methods for bike sharing demand prediction are mostly based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding it as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different transportation modes. This is particularly important for bike sharing because it is often used to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite some recent progress, no existing method is capable of leveraging spatiotemporal information from multiple modes and explicitly considers the distribution discrepancy between them, which can easily lead to negative transfer. To address these challenges, this study proposes a domain-adversarial multi-relational graph neural network (DA-MRGNN) for bike sharing demand prediction with multimodal historical data as input. A temporal adversarial adaptation network is introduced to extract shareable features from demand patterns of different modes. To capture correlations between spatial units across modes, we adapt a multi-relational graph neural network (MRGNN) considering both cross-mode similarity and difference. In addition, an explainable GNN technique is developed to understand how our proposed model makes predictions. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world bike sharing, subway and ride-hailing data from New York City. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing methods and the effectiveness of different model components.

**Abstract:** A first causal discovery analysis from observational data of pyroCb (storm clouds generated from extreme wildfires) is presented. Invariant Causal Prediction was used to develop tools to understand the causal drivers of pyroCb formation. This includes a conditional independence test for testing $Y$ conditionally independent of $E$ given $X$ for binary variable $Y$ and multivariate, continuous variables $X$ and $E$, and a greedy-ICP search algorithm that relies on fewer conditional independence tests to obtain a smaller more manageable set of causal predictors. With these tools, we identified a subset of seven causal predictors which are plausible when contrasted with domain knowledge: surface sensible heat flux, relative humidity at $850$ hPa, a component of wind at $250$ hPa, $13.3$ micro-meters, thermal emissions, convective available potential energy, and altitude.

**Abstract:** Wireless tags are increasingly used to track and identify common items of interest such as retail goods, food, medicine, clothing, books, documents, keys, equipment, and more. At the same time, there is a need for labelled visual data featuring such items for the purpose of training object detection and recognition models for robots operating in homes, warehouses, stores, libraries, pharmacies, and so on. In this paper, we ask: can we leverage the tracking and identification capabilities of such tags as a basis for a large-scale automatic image annotation system for robotic perception tasks? We present RF-Annotate, a pipeline for autonomous pixel-wise image annotation which enables robots to collect labelled visual data of objects of interest as they encounter them within their environment. Our pipeline uses unmodified commodity RFID readers and RGB-D cameras, and exploits arbitrary small-scale motions afforded by mobile robotic platforms to spatially map RFIDs to corresponding objects in the scene. Our only assumption is that the objects of interest within the environment are pre-tagged with inexpensive battery-free RFIDs costing 3-15 cents each. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline on several RGB-D sequences of tabletop scenes featuring common objects in a variety of indoor environments.

In this paper, we present a practical reinforcement learning method which improves upon such existing policies with a model-based approach for better sample efficiency. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-based methods, in terms of sample efficiency, on several widely used robotic benchmark tasks. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a control problem in the telecommunications domain, where model-based methods have not previously been explored. Experimental results indicate that a strong initial performance can be achieved and combined with improved sample efficiency. We further motivate the design of our algorithm with a theoretical lower bound on the performance.

**Abstract:** Deep generative models for audio synthesis have recently been significantly improved. However, the task of modeling raw-waveforms remains a difficult problem, especially for audio waveforms and music signals. Recently, the realtime audio variational autoencoder (RAVE) method was developed for high-quality audio waveform synthesis. The RAVE method is based on the variational autoencoder and utilizes the two-stage training strategy. Unfortunately, the RAVE model is limited in reproducing wide-pitch polyphonic music sound. Therefore, to enhance the reconstruction performance, we adopt the pitch activation data as an auxiliary information to the RAVE model. To handle the auxiliary information, we propose an enhanced RAVE model with a conditional variational autoencoder structure and an additional fully-connected layer. To evaluate the proposed structure, we conducted a listening experiment based on multiple stimulus tests with hidden references and an anchor (MUSHRA) with the MAESTRO. The obtained results indicate that the proposed model exhibits a more significant performance and stability improvement than the conventional RAVE model.

**Abstract:** To align conditional text generation model outputs with desired behaviors, there has been an increasing focus on training the model using reinforcement learning (RL) with reward functions learned from human annotations. Under this framework, we identify three common cases where high rewards are incorrectly assigned to undesirable patterns: noise-induced spurious correlation, naturally occurring spurious correlation, and covariate shift. We show that even though learned metrics achieve high performance on the distribution of the data used to train the reward function, the undesirable patterns may be amplified during RL training of the text generation model. While there has been discussion about reward gaming in the RL or safety community, in this short discussion piece, we would like to highlight reward gaming in the NLG community using concrete conditional text generation examples and discuss potential fixes and areas for future work.

**Abstract:** Although neural networks have seen tremendous success as predictive models in a variety of domains, they can be overly confident in their predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To be viable for safety-critical applications, like autonomous vehicles, neural networks must accurately estimate their epistemic or model uncertainty, achieving a level of system self-awareness. Techniques for epistemic uncertainty quantification often require OOD data during training or multiple neural network forward passes during inference. These approaches may not be suitable for real-time performance on high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, existing methods lack interpretability of the estimated uncertainty, which limits their usefulness both to engineers for further system development and to downstream modules in the autonomy stack. We propose the use of evidential deep learning to estimate the epistemic uncertainty over a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space in a trajectory prediction setting. We introduce an interpretable paradigm for trajectory prediction that distributes the uncertainty among the semantic concepts: past agent behavior, road structure, and social context. We validate our approach on real-world autonomous driving data, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** The active inference framework (AIF) is a promising new computational framework grounded in contemporary neuroscience that can produce human-like behavior through reward-based learning. In this study, we test the ability for the AIF to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-explored -- that of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed "neural" AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy. Together, these results demonstrate the use of AIF as a plausible model of anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans.

A logarithmic reduction in error rate is obtained with a linear increase in sample count. The technique is applied to specific emitter identification on a published dataset of physically recorded over-the-air signals from 16 ostensibly identical high-performance radios. The technique uses a multi-channel deep learning convolutional neural network acting on the bispectra of I/Q signal subsamples each consisting of 56 parts per million (ppm) of the original signal duration. High levels of accuracy are obtained with minimal computation time: in this application, each addition of eight samples decreases error by one order of magnitude.

**Abstract:** Recent unsupervised multi-object detection models have shown impressive performance improvements, largely attributed to novel architectural inductive biases. Unfortunately, they may produce suboptimal object encodings for downstream tasks. To overcome this, we propose to exploit object motion and continuity, i.e., objects do not pop in and out of existence. This is accomplished through two mechanisms: (i) providing priors on the location of objects through integration of optical flow, and (ii) a contrastive object continuity loss across consecutive image frames. Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) scheme can be instantiated using any baseline object detection model. Our results show large improvements in the performances of a SOTA model in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction.

**Abstract:** Recent interest in integrated sensing and communications has led to the design of novel signal processing techniques to recover information from an overlaid radar-communications signal. Here, we focus on a spectral coexistence scenario, wherein the channels and transmit signals of both radar and communications systems are unknown to the common receiver. In this dual-blind deconvolution (DBD) problem, the receiver admits a multi-carrier wireless communications signal that is overlaid with the radar signal reflected off multiple targets. The communications and radar channels are represented by continuous-valued range-times or delays corresponding to multiple transmission paths and targets, respectively. Prior works addressed recovery of unknown channels and signals in this ill-posed DBD problem through atomic norm minimization but contingent on individual minimum separation conditions for radar and communications channels. In this paper, we provide an optimal joint separation condition using extremal functions from the Beurling-Selberg interpolation theory. Thereafter, we formulate DBD as a low-rank modified Hankel matrix retrieval and solve it via nuclear norm minimization. We estimate the unknown target and communications parameters from the recovered low-rank matrix using multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. We show that the joint separation condition also guarantees that the underlying Vandermonde matrix for MUSIC is well-conditioned. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.

**Abstract:** The progress in modelling time series and, more generally, sequences of structured-data has recently revamped research in anomaly detection. The task stands for identifying abnormal behaviours in financial series, IT systems, aerospace measurements, and the medical domain, where anomaly detection may aid in isolating cases of depression and attend the elderly. Anomaly detection in time series is a complex task since anomalies are rare due to highly non-linear temporal correlations and since the definition of anomalous is sometimes subjective. Here we propose the novel use of Hyperbolic uncertainty for Anomaly Detection (HypAD). HypAD learns self-supervisedly to reconstruct the input signal. We adopt best practices from the state-of-the-art to encode the sequence by an LSTM, jointly learnt with a decoder to reconstruct the signal, with the aid of GAN critics. Uncertainty is estimated end-to-end by means of a hyperbolic neural network. By using uncertainty, HypAD may assess whether it is certain about the input signal but it fails to reconstruct it because this is anomalous; or whether the reconstruction error does not necessarily imply anomaly, as the model is uncertain, e.g. a complex but regular input signal. The novel key idea is that a detectable anomaly is one where the model is certain but it predicts wrongly. HypAD outperforms the current state-of-the-art for univariate anomaly detection on established benchmarks based on data from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, Twitter. It also yields state-of-the-art performance on a multivariate dataset of anomaly activities in elderly home residences, and it outperforms the baseline on SWaT. Overall, HypAD yields the lowest false alarms at the best performance rate, thanks to successfully identifying detectable anomalies.

**Abstract:** Tasks critical to enterprise profitability, such as customer churn prediction, fraudulent account detection or customer lifetime value estimation, are often tackled by models trained on features engineered from customer data in tabular format. Application-specific feature engineering adds development, operationalization and maintenance costs over time. Recent advances in representation learning present an opportunity to simplify and generalize feature engineering across applications. When applying these advancements to tabular data researchers deal with data heterogeneity, variations in customer engagement history or the sheer volume of enterprise datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to encode tabular data containing customer transactions, purchase history and other interactions into a generic representation of a customer's association with the business. We then evaluate these embeddings as features to train multiple models spanning a variety of applications. CASPR, Customer Activity Sequence-based Prediction and Representation, applies Transformer architecture to encode activity sequences to improve model performance and avoid bespoke feature engineering across applications. Our experiments at scale validate CASPR for both small and large enterprise applications.

**Abstract:** Intelligent music generation, one of the most popular subfields of computer creativity, can lower the creative threshold for non-specialists and increase the efficiency of music creation. In the last five years, the quality of algorithm-based automatic music generation has increased significantly, motivated by the use of modern generative algorithms to learn the patterns implicit within a piece of music based on rule constraints or a musical corpus, thus generating music samples in various styles. Some of the available literature reviews lack a systematic benchmark of generative models and are traditional and conservative in their perspective, resulting in a vision of the future development of the field that is not deeply integrated with the current rapid scientific progress. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey and analysis of recent intelligent music generation techniques,provide a critical discussion, explicitly identify their respective characteristics, and present them in a general table. We first introduce how music as a stream of information is encoded and the relevant datasets, then compare different types of generation algorithms, summarize their strengths and weaknesses, and discuss existing methods for evaluation. Finally, the development of artificial intelligence in composition is studied, especially by comparing the different characteristics of music generation techniques in the East and West and analyzing the development prospects in this field.

**Abstract:** Few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging learning problem in which only a few samples are available for each class. Decision interpretation is more important in few-shot classification since there is a greater chance of error than in traditional classification. However, most of the previous FSL methods are black-box models. In this paper, we propose an inherently interpretable model for FSL based on human-friendly attributes. Moreover, we propose an online attribute selection mechanism that can effectively filter out irrelevant attributes in each episode. The attribute selection mechanism improves the accuracy and helps with interpretability by reducing the number of participated attributes in each episode. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results on par with black-box few-shot-learning models on four widely used datasets. To further close the performance gap with the black-box models, we propose a mechanism that trades interpretability for accuracy. It automatically detects the episodes where the provided human-friendly attributes are not adequate, and compensates by engaging learned unknown attributes.

**Abstract:** Hippocampal place cells can encode spatial locations of an animal in physical or task-relevant spaces. We simulated place cell populations that encoded either Euclidean- or graph-based positions of a rat navigating to goal nodes in a maze with a graph topology, and used manifold learning methods such as UMAP and Autoencoders (AE) to analyze these neural population activities. The structure of the latent spaces learned by the AE reflects their true geometric structure, while PCA fails to do so and UMAP is less robust to noise. Our results support future applications of AE architectures to decipher the geometry of spatial encoding in the brain.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we perform the convergence analysis of unsupervised Legendre--Galerkin neural networks (ULGNet), a deep-learning-based numerical method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing deep learning-based numerical methods for PDEs, the ULGNet expresses the solution as a spectral expansion with respect to the Legendre basis and predicts the coefficients with deep neural networks by solving a variational residual minimization problem. Since the corresponding loss function is equivalent to the residual induced by the linear algebraic system depending on the choice of basis functions, we prove that the minimizer of the discrete loss function converges to the weak solution of the PDEs. Numerical evidence will also be provided to support the theoretical result. Key technical tools include the variant of the universal approximation theorem for bounded neural networks, the analysis of the stiffness and mass matrices, and the uniform law of large numbers in terms of the Rademacher complexity.

**Abstract:** Tabla is a North Indian percussion instrument used as an accompaniment and an exclusive instrument for solo performances. Tabla solo is intricate and elaborate, exhibiting rhythmic evolution through a sequence of homogeneous sections marked by shared rhythmic characteristics. Each section has a specific structure and name associated with it. Tabla learning and performance in the Indian subcontinent is based on stylistic schools called gharana-s. Several compositions by various composers from different gharana-s are played in each section. This paper addresses the task of segmenting the tabla solo concert into musically meaningful sections. We then assign suitable section labels and recognize gharana-s from the sections. We present a diverse collection of over 38 hours of solo tabla recordings for the task. We motivate the problem and present different challenges and facets of the tasks. Inspired by the distinct musical properties of tabla solo, we compute several rhythmic and timbral features for the segmentation task. This work explores the approach of automatically locating the significant changes in the rhythmic structure by analyzing local self-similarity in an unsupervised manner. We also explore supervised random forest and a convolutional neural network trained on hand-crafted features. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches are also tested on a set of held-out recordings. Segmentation of an audio piece into its structural components and labeling is crucial to many music information retrieval applications like repetitive structure finding, audio summarization, and fast music navigation. This work helps us obtain a comprehensive musical description of the tabla solo concert.

**Abstract:** Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has attracted significant attention from the research community. Many recent LNL methods rely on the assumption that clean samples tend to have "small loss". However, this assumption always fails to generalize to some real-world cases with imbalanced subpopulations, i.e., training subpopulations varying in sample size or recognition difficulty. Therefore, recent LNL methods face the risk of misclassifying those "informative" samples (e.g., hard samples or samples in the tail subpopulations) into noisy samples, leading to poor generalization performance.
  To address the above issue, we propose a novel LNL method to simultaneously deal with noisy labels and imbalanced subpopulations. It first leverages sample correlation to estimate samples' clean probabilities for label correction and then utilizes corrected labels for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to further improve the robustness. Specifically, in contrast to previous works using classification loss as the selection criterion, we introduce a feature-based metric that takes the sample correlation into account for estimating samples' clean probabilities. Then, we refurbish the noisy labels using the estimated clean probabilities and the pseudo-labels from the model's predictions. With refurbished labels, we use DRO to train the model to be robust to subpopulation imbalance. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that our technique can consistently improve current state-of-the-art robust learning paradigms against noisy labels, especially when encountering imbalanced subpopulations.

**Abstract:** Early diagnosis of dementia, particularly in the prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, or MCI), has become a research and clinical priority but remains challenging. Automated analysis of the drawing process has been studied as a promising means for screening prodromal and clinical dementia, providing multifaceted information encompassing features, such as drawing speed, pen posture, writing pressure, and pauses. We examined the feasibility of using these features not only for detecting prodromal and clinical dementia but also for predicting the severity of cognitive impairments assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as well as the severity of neuropathological changes assessed by medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. We collected drawing data with a digitizing tablet and pen from 145 older adults of cognitively normal (CN), MCI, and dementia. The nested cross-validation results indicate that the combination of drawing features could be used to classify CN, MCI, and dementia with an AUC of 0.909 and 75.1% accuracy (CN vs. MCI: 82.4% accuracy; CN vs. dementia: 92.2% accuracy; MCI vs. dementia: 80.3% accuracy) and predict MMSE scores with an $R^2$ of 0.491 and severity of MTL atrophy with an $R^2$ of 0.293. Our findings suggest that automated analysis of the drawing process can provide information about cognitive impairments and neuropathological changes due to dementia, which can help identify prodromal and clinical dementia as a digital biomarker.

**Abstract:** We present a novel framework for explainable labeling and interpretation of medical images. Medical images require specialized professionals for interpretation, and are explained (typically) via elaborate textual reports. Different from prior methods that focus on medical report generation from images or vice-versa, we novelly generate congruent image--report pairs employing a cyclic-Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN); thereby, the generated report will adequately explain a medical image, while a report-generated image that effectively characterizes the text visually should (sufficiently) resemble the original. The aim of the work is to generate trustworthy and faithful explanations for the outputs of a model diagnosing chest x-ray images by pointing a human user to similar cases in support of a diagnostic decision. Apart from enabling transparent medical image labeling and interpretation, we achieve report and image-based labeling comparable to prior methods, including state-of-the-art performance in some cases as evidenced by experiments on the Indiana Chest X-ray dataset

**Abstract:** Improving the scalability of GNNs is critical for large graphs. Existing methods leverage three sampling paradigms including node-wise, layer-wise and subgraph sampling, then design unbiased estimator for scalability. However, the high variance still severely hinders GNNs' performance. On account that previous studies either lacks variance analysis or only focus on a particular sampling paradigm, we firstly propose an unified node sampling variance analysis framework and analyze the core challenge "circular dependency" for deriving the minimum variance sampler, i. e., sampling probability depends on node embeddings while node embeddings can not be calculated until sampling is finished. Existing studies either ignore the node embeddings or introduce external parameters, resulting in the lack of a both efficient and effective variance reduction methods. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{E}stimation based \textbf{S}ampling GNN (HE-SGNN) with first level estimating the node embeddings in sampling probability to break circular dependency, and second level employing sampling GNN operator to estimate the nodes' representations on the entire graph. Considering the technical difference, we propose different first level estimator, i.e., a time series simulation for layer-wise sampling and a feature based simulation for subgraph sampling. The experimental results on seven representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

**Abstract:** We introduce a new model based on sets of probabilities for sequential data. We name the model GAMMT, which stands for Generative Ambiguity Models using Multiple Transformers. We suppose that data generating process of a sequence is ambiguous and determined by a set of probabilities rather than one as in the conventional model. We use multiple parallel transformers connected by a selection mechanism to approximate ambiguous probabilities. The GAMMT allows for ambiguity modeling in a generative way and multiple representations of the input tokens and the input sequence. This work explores the combination of attention mechanism and ambiguity by deep neural networks. We expect that this framework will facilitate new research into machine learning, improving our understanding of the attention-ambiguity mechanism.

**Abstract:** Decades of research on the 0-1 knapsack problem led to very efficient algorithms that are able to quickly solve large problem instances to optimality. This prompted researchers to also investigate whether relatively small problem instances exist that are hard for existing solvers and investigate which features characterize their hardness. Previously the authors proposed a new class of hard 0-1 knapsack problem instances and demonstrated that the properties of so-called inclusionwise maximal solutions (IMSs) can be important hardness indicators for this class. In the current paper, we formulate several new computationally challenging problems related to the IMSs of arbitrary 0-1 knapsack problem instances. Based on generalizations of previous work and new structural results about IMSs, we formulate polynomial and pseudopolynomial time algorithms for solving these problems. From this we derive a set of 14 computationally expensive features, which we calculate for two large datasets on a supercomputer in approximately 540 CPU-hours. We show that the proposed features contain important information related to the empirical hardness of a problem instance that was missing in earlier features from the literature by training machine learning models that can accurately predict the empirical hardness of a wide variety of 0-1 knapsack problem instances. Using the instance space analysis methodology, we also show that hard 0-1 knapsack problem instances are clustered together around a relatively dense region of the instance space and several features behave differently in the easy and hard parts of the instance space.

**Abstract:** This paper aims to develop resilient transmission mechanisms to suitably distribute traffic across multiple paths in an arbitrary millimeter-wave (mmWave) network. The main contributions include: (a) the development of proactive transmission mechanisms that build resilience against network disruptions in advance, while achieving a high end-to-end packet rate; (b) the design of a heuristic path selection algorithm that efficiently selects (in polynomial time in the network size) multiple proactively resilient paths with high packet rates; and (c) the development of a hybrid scheduling algorithm that combines the proposed path selection algorithm with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based online approach for decentralized adaptation to blocked links and failed paths. To achieve resilience to link failures, a state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic DRL algorithm, which adapts the information flow through the network, is investigated. The proposed scheduling algorithm robustly adapts to link failures over different topologies, channel and blockage realizations while offering a superior performance to alternative algorithms.

**Abstract:** We present the first Learning-Augmented Binary Search Tree(BST) that attains Static Optimality and Working-Set Bound given rough predictions. Following the recent studies in algorithms with predictions and learned index structures, Lin, Luo, and Woodruff (ICML 2022) introduced the concept of Learning-Augmented BSTs, which aim to improve BSTs with learned advice. Unfortunately, their construction gives only static optimality under strong assumptions on the input.
  In this paper, we present a simple BST maintenance scheme that benefits from learned advice. With proper predictions, the scheme achieves Static Optimality and Working-Set Bound, respectively, which are important performance measures for BSTs. Moreover, the scheme is robust to prediction errors and makes no assumption on the input.

**Abstract:** Group lasso is a commonly used regularization method in statistical learning in which parameters are eliminated from the model according to predefined groups. However, when the groups overlap, optimizing the group lasso penalized objective can be time-consuming on large-scale problems because of the non-separability induced by the overlapping groups. This bottleneck has seriously limited the application of overlapping group lasso regularization in many modern problems, such as gene pathway selection and graphical model estimation. In this paper, we propose a separable penalty as an approximation of the overlapping group lasso penalty. Thanks to the separability, the computation of regularization based on our penalty is substantially faster than that of the overlapping group lasso, especially for large-scale and high-dimensional problems. We show that the penalty is the tightest separable relaxation of the overlapping group lasso norm within the family of $\ell_{q_1}/\ell_{q_2}$ norms. Moreover, we show that the estimator based on the proposed separable penalty is statistically equivalent to the one based on the overlapping group lasso penalty with respect to their error bounds and the rate-optimal performance under the squared loss. We demonstrate the faster computational time and statistical equivalence of our method compared with the overlapping group lasso in simulation examples and a classification problem of cancer tumors based on gene expression and multiple gene pathways.

**Abstract:** This work provides theoretical foundations for kernel methods in the hyperspherical context. Specifically, we characterise the native spaces (reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces) and the Sobolev spaces associated with kernels defined over hyperspheres. Our results have direct consequences for kernel cubature, determining the rate of convergence of the worst case error, and expanding the applicability of cubature algorithms based on Stein's method. We first introduce a suitable characterisation on Sobolev spaces on the $d$-dimensional hypersphere embedded in $(d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Our characterisation is based on the Fourier--Schoenberg sequences associated with a given kernel. Such sequences are hard (if not impossible) to compute analytically on $d$-dimensional spheres, but often feasible over Hilbert spheres. We circumvent this problem by finding a projection operator that allows to Fourier mapping from Hilbert into finite dimensional hyperspheres. We illustrate our findings through some parametric families of kernels.

**Abstract:** Comparing Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with different widths is challenging because, as the width increases, multiple model properties change simultaneously, and, inference in the finite-width case is intractable. In this work, we empirically compare finite- and infinite-width BNNs, and provide quantitative and qualitative explanations for their performance difference. We find that when the model is mis-specified, increasing width can hurt BNN performance. In these cases, we provide evidence that finite-width BNNs generalize better partially due to the properties of their frequency spectrum that allows them to adapt under model mismatch.

**Abstract:** Finding similar data in high-dimensional spaces is one of the important tasks in multimedia applications. Approaches introduced to find exact searching techniques often use tree-based index structures which are known to suffer from the curse of the dimensionality problem that limits their performance. Approximate searching techniques prefer performance over accuracy and they return good enough results while achieving a better performance. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular approximate nearest neighbor search techniques for high-dimensional spaces. One of the most time-consuming processes in LSH is to find the neighboring points in the projected spaces. An improved LSH-based index structure, called radius-optimized Locality Sensitive Hashing (roLSH) has been proposed to utilize Machine Learning and efficiently find these neighboring points; thus, further improve the overall performance of LSH. In this paper, we extend roLSH by experimentally studying the effect of different types of famous Machine Learning techniques on overall performance. We compare ten regression techniques on four real-world datasets and show that Neural Network-based techniques are the best fit to be used in roLSH as their accuracy and performance trade-off are the best compared to the other techniques.

**Abstract:** As one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide, Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) occurs when the blood supply to the brain is suddenly interrupted because of a blocked artery. Within seconds of AIS onset, the brain cells surrounding the blocked artery die, which leads to the progression of the lesion. The automated and precise prediction of the existing lesion plays a vital role in the AIS treatment planning and prevention of further injuries. The current standard AIS assessment method, which thresholds the 3D measurement maps extracted from Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) images, is not accurate enough. Due to this fact, in this article, we propose the imbalanced Temporal Deep Gaussian Process (iTDGP), a probabilistic model that can improve AIS lesions prediction by using baseline CTP time series. Our proposed model can effectively extract temporal information from the CTP time series and map it to the class labels of the brain's voxels. In addition, by using batch training and voxel-level analysis iTDGP can learn from a few patients and it is robust against imbalanced classes. Moreover, our model incorporates a post-processor capable of improving prediction accuracy using spatial information. Our comprehensive experiments, on the ISLES 2018 and the University of Alberta Hospital (UAH) datasets, show that iTDGP performs better than state-of-the-art AIS lesion predictors, obtaining the (cross-validation) Dice score of 71.42% and 65.37% with a significant p<0.05, respectively.

**Abstract:** Filters are fundamental in extracting information from data. For time series and image data that reside on Euclidean domains, filters are the crux of many signal processing and machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks. Increasingly, modern data also reside on networks and other irregular domains whose structure is better captured by a graph. To process and learn from such data, graph filters account for the structure of the underlying data domain. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph filters, including the different filtering categories, design strategies for each type, and trade-offs between different types of graph filters. We discuss how to extend graph filters into filter banks and graph neural networks to enhance the representational power; that is, to model a broader variety of signal classes, data patterns, and relationships. We also showcase the fundamental role of graph filters in signal processing and machine learning applications. Our aim is that this article serves the dual purpose of providing a unifying framework for both beginner and experienced researchers, as well as a common understanding that promotes collaborations between signal processing, machine learning, and application domains.

**Abstract:** A recent body of literature has investigated the effect of data poisoning attacks on data-driven control methods. Data poisoning attacks are well-known to the Machine Learning community, which, however, make use of assumptions, such as cross-sample independence, that in general do not hold for dynamical systems. As a consequence, attacks, and detection methods, operate differently from the i.i.d. setting studied in classical supervised problems. In particular, data poisoning attacks against data-driven control methods can be fundamentally seen as changing the behavior of the dynamical system described by the data. In this work, we study this phenomenon through the lens of statistical testing, and verify the detectability of different attacks for a linear dynamical system. On the basis of the arguments hereby presented, we propose a stealthy data poisoning attack that can escape classical detection tests, and conclude by showing the efficiency of the proposed attack.

**Abstract:** Incorporating various mass shapes and sizes in training deep learning architectures has made breast mass segmentation challenging. Moreover, manual segmentation of masses of irregular shapes is time-consuming and error-prone. Though Deep Neural Network has shown outstanding performance in breast mass segmentation, it fails in segmenting micro-masses. In this paper, we propose a novel U-net-shaped transformer-based architecture, called Swin-SFTNet, that outperforms state-of-the-art architectures in breast mammography-based micro-mass segmentation. Firstly to capture the global context, we designed a novel Spatial Feature Expansion and Aggregation Block(SFEA) that transforms sequential linear patches into a structured spatial feature. Next, we combine it with the local linear features extracted by the swin transformer block to improve overall accuracy. We also incorporate a novel embedding loss that calculates similarities between linear feature embeddings of the encoder and decoder blocks. With this approach, we achieve higher segmentation dice over the state-of-the-art by 3.10% on CBIS-DDSM, 3.81% on InBreast, and 3.13% on CBIS pre-trained model on the InBreast test data set.

**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are everywhere, frequently performing a fairly complex task that used to be unimaginable for machines to carry out. In doing so, they do a lot of decision making which, depending on the application, may be disastrous if gone wrong. This necessitates a formal argument that the underlying neural networks satisfy certain desirable properties. Robustness is one such key property for DNNs, particularly if they are being deployed in safety or business critical applications. Informally speaking, a DNN is not robust if very small changes to its input may affect the output in a considerable way (e.g. changes the classification for that input). The task of finding an adversarial example is to demonstrate this lack of robustness, whenever applicable. While this is doable with the help of constrained optimization techniques, scalability becomes a challenge due to large-sized networks. This paper proposes the use of information gathered by preprocessing the DNN to heavily simplify the optimization problem. Our experiments substantiate that this is effective, and does significantly better than the state-of-the-art.

**Abstract:** Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a relatively new field which builds on conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve multi-objective problems. One of common algorithm is to extend scalar value Q-learning by using vector Q values in combination with a utility function, which captures the user's preference for action selection. This study follows on prior works, and focuses on what factors influence the frequency with which value-based MORL Q-learning algorithms learn the optimal policy for an environment with stochastic state transitions in scenarios where the goal is to maximise the Scalarised Expected Return (SER) - that is, to maximise the average outcome over multiple runs rather than the outcome within each individual episode. The analysis of the interaction between stochastic environment and MORL Q-learning algorithms run on a simple Multi-objective Markov decision process (MOMDP) Space Traders problem with different variant versions. The empirical evaluations show that well designed reward signal can improve the performance of the original baseline algorithm, however it is still not enough to address more general environment. A variant of MORL Q-Learning incorporating global statistics is shown to outperform the baseline method in original Space Traders problem, but remains below 100 percent effectiveness in finding the find desired SER-optimal policy at the end of training. On the other hand, Option learning is guarantied to converge to desired SER-optimal policy but it is not able to scale up to solve more complex problem in real-life. The main contribution of this thesis is to identify the extent to which the issue of noisy Q-value estimates impacts on the ability to learn optimal policies under the combination of stochastic environments, non-linear utility and a constant learning rate.

**Abstract:** Collaborative filtering is one of the most influential recommender system types. Various methods have been proposed for collaborative filtering, ranging from matrix factorization to graph convolutional methods. Being inspired by recent successes of GF-CF and diffusion models, we present a novel concept of blurring-sharpening process model (BSPM). Diffusion models and BSPMs share the same processing philosophy in that new information is discovered (e.g., a new image is generated in the case of diffusion models) while original information is first perturbed and then recovered to its original form. However, diffusion models and our BSPMs deal with different types of information, and their optimal perturbation and recovery processes have a fundamental discrepancy. Therefore, our BSPMs have different forms from diffusion models. In addition, our concept not only theoretically subsumes many existing collaborative filtering models but also outperforms them in terms of Recall and NDCG in the three benchmark datasets, Gowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-book. Our model marks the best accuracy in them. In addition, the processing time of our method is one of the shortest cases ever in collaborative filtering. Our proposed concept has much potential in the future to be enhanced by designing better blurring (i.e., perturbation) and sharpening (i.e., recovery) processes than what we use in this paper.

**Abstract:** Blockchains with smart contracts are distributed ledger systems which achieve block state consistency among distributed nodes by only allowing deterministic operations of smart contracts. However, the power of smart contracts is enabled by interacting with stochastic off-chain data, which in turn opens the possibility to undermine the block state consistency. To address this issue, an oracle smart contract is used to provide a single consistent source of external data; but, simultaneously this introduces a single point of failure, which is called the oracle problem. To address the oracle problem, we propose an adaptive conformal consensus (ACon$^2$) algorithm, which derives consensus from multiple oracle contracts via the recent advance in online uncertainty quantification learning. In particular, the proposed algorithm returns a consensus set, which quantifies the uncertainty of data and achieves a desired correctness guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries and distribution shift. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on two price datasets and an Ethereum case study. In particular, the Solidity implementation of the proposed algorithm shows the practicality of the proposed algorithm, implying that online machine learning algorithms are applicable to address issues in blockchains.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose the augmented physics-informed neural network (APINN), which adopts soft and trainable domain decomposition and flexible parameter sharing to further improve the extended PINN (XPINN) as well as the vanilla PINN methods. In particular, a trainable gate network is employed to mimic the hard and discrete decomposition of XPINN, which can be flexibly fine-tuned for discovering a potentially better partition. It weight-averages several sub-nets as the output of APINN. APINN does not require complex interface conditions, and its sub-nets can take advantage of all training samples rather than just part of the training data in their subdomains. Lastly, each sub-net shares part of the common parameters to capture the similar components in each decomposed function. Furthermore, following the PINN generalization theory in Hu et al. [2021], we show that APINN can improve generalization by proper gate network initialization and general domain & function decomposition. Extensive experiments on different types of PDEs demonstrate how APINN improves the PINN and XPINN methods. Specifically, we present examples where XPINN performs similarly to or worse than PINN, so that APINN can significantly improve both. We also show cases where XPINN is already better than PINN, so APINN can still slightly improve XPINN. Furthermore, we visualize the optimized gating networks and their optimization trajectories, and connect them with their performance, which helps discover the possibly optimal decomposition. Interestingly, if initialized by different decomposition, the performances of corresponding APINNs can differ drastically. This, in turn, shows the potential to design an optimal domain decomposition for the differential equation problem under consideration.

**Abstract:** Generating graph-structured data is a challenging problem, which requires learning the underlying distribution of graphs. Various models such as graph VAE, graph GANs, and graph diffusion models have been proposed to generate meaningful and reliable graphs, among which the diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we argue that running full-rank diffusion SDEs on the whole graph adjacency matrix space hinders diffusion models from learning graph topology generation, and hence significantly deteriorates the quality of generated graph data. To address this limitation, we propose an efficient yet effective Graph Spectral Diffusion Model (GSDM), which is driven by low-rank diffusion SDEs on the graph spectrum space. Our spectral diffusion model is further proven to enjoy a substantially stronger theoretical guarantee than standard diffusion models. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that, our proposed GSDM turns out to be the SOTA model, by exhibiting both significantly higher generation quality and much less computational consumption than the baselines.

**Abstract:** Combinatorial optimizations are usually complex and inefficient, which limits their applications in large-scale networks with billions of links. We introduce a distributed computational method for solving a node-covering problem at the scale of factual scenarios. We first construct a genetic algorithm and then design a two-step strategy to initialize the candidate solutions. All the computational operations are designed and developed in a distributed form on \textit{Apache Spark} enabling fast calculation for practical graphs. We apply our method to social advertising of recalling back churn users in online mobile games, which was previously only treated as a traditional item recommending or ranking problem.
