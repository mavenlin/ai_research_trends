**Abstract:** Standard diffusion models involve an image transform -- adding Gaussian noise -- and an image restoration operator that inverts this degradation. We observe that the generative behavior of diffusion models is not strongly dependent on the choice of image degradation, and in fact an entire family of generative models can be constructed by varying this choice. Even when using completely deterministic degradations (e.g., blur, masking, and more), the training and test-time update rules that underlie diffusion models can be easily generalized to create generative models. The success of these fully deterministic models calls into question the community's understanding of diffusion models, which relies on noise in either gradient Langevin dynamics or variational inference, and paves the way for generalized diffusion models that invert arbitrary processes.

**Abstract:** Variational Bayes (VB) applied to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has become the most popular algorithm for aspect modeling. While sufficiently successful in text topic extraction from large corpora, VB is less successful in identifying aspects in the presence of limited data. We present a novel variational message passing algorithm as applied to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and compare it with the gold standard VB and collapsed Gibbs sampling. In situations where marginalisation leads to non-conjugate messages, we use ideas from sampling to derive approximate update equations. In cases where conjugacy holds, Loopy Belief update (LBU) (also known as Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter) is used. Our algorithm, ALBU (approximate LBU), has strong similarities with Variational Message Passing (VMP) (which is the message passing variant of VB). To compare the performance of the algorithms in the presence of limited data, we use data sets consisting of tweets and news groups. Using coherence measures we show that ALBU learns latent distributions more accurately than does VB, especially for smaller data sets.

**Abstract:** Fact-checking is one of the effective solutions in fighting online misinformation. However, traditional fact-checking is a process requiring scarce expert human resources, and thus does not scale well on social media because of the continuous flow of new content to be checked. Methods based on crowdsourcing have been proposed to tackle this challenge, as they can scale with a smaller cost, but, while they have shown to be feasible, have always been studied in controlled environments. In this work, we study the first large-scale effort of crowdsourced fact-checking deployed in practice, started by Twitter with the Birdwatch program. Our analysis shows that crowdsourcing may be an effective fact-checking strategy in some settings, even comparable to results obtained by human experts, but does not lead to consistent, actionable results in others. We processed 11.9k tweets verified by the Birdwatch program and report empirical evidence of i) differences in how the crowd and experts select content to be fact-checked, ii) how the crowd and the experts retrieve different resources to fact-check, and iii) the edge the crowd shows in fact-checking scalability and efficiency as compared to expert checkers.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel non-stationary dynamic pricing algorithm design, where pricing agents face incomplete demand information and market environment shifts. The agents run price experiments to learn about each product's demand curve and the profit-maximizing price, while being aware of market environment shifts to avoid high opportunity costs from offering sub-optimal prices. The proposed ACIDP extends information-directed sampling (IDS) algorithms from statistical machine learning to include microeconomic choice theory, with a novel pricing strategy auditing procedure to escape sub-optimal pricing after market environment shift. The proposed ACIDP outperforms competing bandit algorithms including Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS) in a series of market environment shifts.

**Abstract:** Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems perform a sequence-to-sequence task, where an input word sequence containing grammatical errors, is corrected for these errors by the GEC system to output a grammatically correct word sequence. With the advent of deep learning methods, automated GEC systems have become increasingly popular. For example, GEC systems are often used on speech transcriptions of English learners as a form of assessment and feedback - these powerful GEC systems can be used to automatically measure an aspect of a candidate's fluency. The count of \textit{edits} from a candidate's input sentence (or essay) to a GEC system's grammatically corrected output sentence is indicative of a candidate's language ability, where fewer edits suggest better fluency. The count of edits can thus be viewed as a \textit{fluency score} with zero implying perfect fluency. However, although deep learning based GEC systems are extremely powerful and accurate, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks: an adversary can introduce a small, specific change at the input of a system that causes a large, undesired change at the output. When considering the application of GEC systems to automated language assessment, the aim of an adversary could be to cheat by making a small change to a grammatically incorrect input sentence that conceals the errors from a GEC system, such that no edits are found and the candidate is unjustly awarded a perfect fluency score. This work examines a simple universal substitution adversarial attack that non-native speakers of English could realistically employ to deceive GEC systems used for assessment.

**Abstract:** Semantic textual similarity (STS) in the clinical domain helps improve diagnostic efficiency and produce concise texts for downstream data mining tasks. However, given the high degree of domain knowledge involved in clinic text, it remains challenging for general language models to infer implicit medical relationships behind clinical sentences and output similarities correctly. In this paper, we present a graph-augmented cyclic learning framework for similarity estimation in the clinical domain. The framework can be conveniently implemented on a state-of-art backbone language model, and improve its performance by leveraging domain knowledge through co-training with an auxiliary graph convolution network (GCN) based network. We report the success of introducing domain knowledge in GCN and the co-training framework by improving the Bio-clinical BERT baseline by 16.3% and 27.9%, respectively.

**Abstract:** One of the latest applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to generate images from natural language descriptions. These generators are now becoming available and achieve impressive results that have been used for example in the front cover of magazines. As the input to the generators is in the form of a natural language text, a question that arises immediately is how these models behave when the input is written in different languages. In this paper we perform an initial exploration of how the performance of three popular text-to-image generators depends on the language. The results show that there is a significant performance degradation when using languages other than English, especially for languages that are not widely used. This observation leads us to discuss different alternatives on how text-to-image generators can be improved so that performance is consistent across different languages. This is fundamental to ensure that this new technology can be used by non-native English speakers and to preserve linguistic diversity.

**Abstract:** Choice modeling has been a central topic in the study of individual preference or utility across many fields including economics, marketing, operations research, and psychology. While the vast majority of the literature on choice models has been devoted to the analytical properties that lead to managerial and policy-making insights, the existing methods to learn a choice model from empirical data are often either computationally intractable or sample inefficient. In this paper, we develop deep learning-based choice models under two settings of choice modeling: (i) feature-free and (ii) feature-based. Our model captures both the intrinsic utility for each candidate choice and the effect that the assortment has on the choice probability. Synthetic and real data experiments demonstrate the performances of proposed models in terms of the recovery of the existing choice models, sample complexity, assortment effect, architecture design, and model interpretation.

**Abstract:** Robust speech emotion recognition relies on the quality of the speech features. We present speech features enhancement strategy that improves speech emotion recognition. We used the INTERSPEECH 2010 challenge feature-set. We identified subsets from the features set and applied Principle Component Analysis to the subsets. Finally, the features are fused horizontally. The resulting feature set is analyzed using t-distributed neighbour embeddings (t-SNE) before the application of features for emotion recognition. The method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods used in the literature. The empirical evidence is drawn using two well-known datasets: Emotional Speech Dataset (EMO-DB) and Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) for two languages, German and English, respectively. Our method achieved an average recognition gain of 11.5\% for six out of seven emotions for the EMO-DB dataset, and 13.8\% for seven out of eight emotions for the RAVDESS dataset as compared to the baseline study.

**Abstract:** We propose formulating the finite-horizon stochastic optimal control problem for colloidal self-assembly in the space of probability density functions (PDFs) of the underlying state variables (namely, order parameters). The control objective is formulated in terms of steering the state PDFs from a prescribed initial probability measure towards a prescribed terminal probability measure with minimum control effort. For specificity, we use a univariate stochastic state model from the literature. Both the analysis and the computational steps for control synthesis as developed in this paper generalize for multivariate stochastic state dynamics given by generic nonlinear in state and non-affine in control models. We derive the conditions of optimality for the associated optimal control problem. This derivation yields a system of three coupled partial differential equations together with the boundary conditions at the initial and terminal times. The resulting system is a generalized instance of the so-called SchrÃ¶dinger bridge problem. We then determine the optimal control policy by training a physics-informed deep neural network, where the "physics" are the derived conditions of optimality. The performance of the proposed solution is demonstrated via numerical simulations on a benchmark colloidal self-assembly problem.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art machine-learning based models are a popular choice for modelling and forecasting energy behaviour in buildings because given enough data, they are good at finding spatiotemporal patterns and structures even in scenarios where the complexity prohibits analytical descriptions. However, machine-learning based models for building energy forecasting have difficulty generalizing to out-of-sample scenarios that are not represented in the data because their architecture typically does not hold physical correspondence to mechanistic structures linked with governing phenomena of energy transfer. Thus, their ability to forecast for unseen initial conditions and boundary conditions wholly depends on the representativeness in the data, which is not guaranteed in building measurement data. Consequently, these limitations impede their application to real-world engineering applications such as energy management in Digital Twins. In response, we present a Domain Adaptation framework that aims to leverage well-known understanding of phenomenon governing energy behavior in buildings to forecast for out of sample scenarios beyond building measurement data. More specifically, we represent mechanistic knowledge of energy behavior using low-rank linear time-invariant state space models and subsequently leverage their governing structure to forecast for a target energy system for which only building measurement data is available. We achieve this by aligning the Physics-derived subspace that governs global state space behavior closer towards the target subspace derived from the measurement data. In this initial exploration we focus on linear energy systems; we test the subspace-based DA framework on a 1D heat conduction scenario by varying the thermophysical properties of the source and target systems to demonstrate the transferability of mechanistic models from Physics to measurement data.

**Abstract:** Event logs are widely used for anomaly detection and prediction in complex systems. Existing log-based anomaly detection methods usually consist of four main steps: log collection, log parsing, feature extraction, and anomaly detection, wherein the feature extraction step extracts useful features for anomaly detection by counting log events. For a complex system, such as a lithography machine consisting of a large number of subsystems, its log may contain thousands of different events, resulting in abounding extracted features. However, when anomaly detection is performed at the subsystem level, analyzing all features becomes expensive and unnecessary. To mitigate this problem, we develop a feature selection method for log-based anomaly detection and prediction, largely improving the effectiveness and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Estimating a Gibbs density function given a sample is an important problem in computational statistics and statistical learning. Although the well established maximum likelihood method is commonly used, it requires the computation of the partition function (i.e., the normalization of the density).
  This function can be easily calculated for simple low-dimensional problems but its computation is difficult or even intractable for general densities and high-dimensional problems. In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimators, we name Maximum Recovery MAP (MR-MAP), to derive estimators that do not require the computation of the partition function, and reformulate the problem as an optimization problem. We further propose a least-action type potential that allows us to quickly solve the optimization problem as a feed-forward hyperbolic neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on some standard data sets.

**Abstract:** Multi-task learning of dense prediction tasks, by sharing both the encoder and decoder, as opposed to sharing only the encoder, provides an attractive front to increase both accuracy and computational efficiency. When the tasks are similar, sharing the decoder serves as an additional inductive bias providing more room for tasks to share complementary information among themselves. However, increased sharing exposes more parameters to task interference which likely hinders both generalization and robustness. Effective ways to curb this interference while exploiting the inductive bias of sharing the decoder remains an open challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Progressive Decoder Fusion (PDF) to progressively combine task decoders based on inter-task representation similarity. We show that this procedure leads to a multi-task network with better generalization to in-distribution and out-of-distribution data and improved robustness to adversarial attacks. Additionally, we observe that the predictions of different tasks of this multi-task network are more consistent with each other.

**Abstract:** Interpretability of Deep Learning (DL) models is arguably the barrier in front of trustworthy AI. Despite great efforts made by the Explainable AI (XAI) community, explanations lack robustness--indistinguishable input perturbations may lead to different XAI results. Thus, it is vital to assess how robust DL interpretability is, given an XAI technique. To this end, we identify the following challenges that state-of-the-art is unable to cope with collectively: i) XAI techniques are highly heterogeneous; ii) misinterpretations are normally rare events; iii) both worst-case and overall robustness are of practical interest. In this paper, we propose two evaluation methods to tackle them--i) they are of black-box nature, based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Subset Simulation (SS); ii) bespoke fitness functions are used by GA to solve a constrained optimisation efficiently, while SS is dedicated to estimating rare event probabilities; iii) two diverse metrics are introduced, concerning the worst-case interpretation discrepancy and a probabilistic notion of \textit{how} robust in general, respectively. We conduct experiments to study the accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency of our methods that outperform state-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of our methods for ranking robust XAI methods and selecting training schemes to improve both classification and interpretation robustness.

**Abstract:** We study Stackelberg games where a principal repeatedly interacts with a long-lived, non-myopic agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function. Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is myopic, non-myopic agents pose additional complications. In particular, non-myopic agents may strategically select actions that are inferior in the present to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better outcomes in the future.
  We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games (SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, strategic classification, and general finite Stackelberg games. In each setting, we characterize the type and impact of misspecifications present in near-best-responses and develop a learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications.
  Along the way, we improve the query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$ targets from the state-of-the-art $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$ by uncovering a fundamental structural property of such games. This result is of independent interest beyond learning with non-myopic agents.

**Abstract:** The imputation of missing values represents a significant obstacle for many real-world data analysis pipelines. Here, we focus on time series data and put forward SSSD, an imputation model that relies on two emerging technologies, (conditional) diffusion models as state-of-the-art generative models and structured state space models as internal model architecture, which are particularly suited to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. We demonstrate that SSSD matches or even exceeds state-of-the-art probabilistic imputation and forecasting performance on a broad range of data sets and different missingness scenarios, including the challenging blackout-missing scenarios, where prior approaches failed to provide meaningful results.

**Abstract:** Modern machine learning models use an ever-increasing number of parameters to train (175 billion parameters for GPT-3) with large datasets to obtain better performance. Bigger is better has been the norm. Optical computing has been reawakened as a potential solution to large-scale computing through optical accelerators that carry out linear operations while reducing electrical power. However, to achieve efficient computing with light, creating and controlling nonlinearity optically rather than electronically remains a challenge. This study explores a reservoir computing (RC) approach whereby a 14 mm long few-mode waveguide in LiNbO3 on insulator is used as a complex nonlinear optical processor. A dataset is encoded digitally on the spectrum of a femtosecond pulse which is then launched in the waveguide. The output spectrum depends nonlinearly on the input. We experimentally show that a simple digital linear classifier with 784 parameters using the output spectrum from the waveguide as input increased the classification accuracy of several databases compared to non-transformed data, approximately 10$\%$. In comparison, a deep digital neural network (NN) with 40000 parameters was necessary to achieve the same accuracy. Reducing the number of parameters by a factor of $\sim$50 illustrates that a compact optical RC approach can perform on par with a deep digital NN.

**Abstract:** Event extraction is an important work of medical text processing. According to the complex characteristics of medical text annotation, we use the end-to-end event extraction model to enhance the output formatting information of events. Through pre training and fine-tuning, we can extract the attributes of the four dimensions of medical text: anatomical position, subject word, description word and occurrence state. On the test set, the accuracy rate was 0.4511, the recall rate was 0.3928, and the F1 value was 0.42. The method of this model is simple, and it has won the second place in the task of mining clinical discovery events (task2) in the Chinese electronic medical record of the seventh China health information processing Conference (chip2021).

**Abstract:** As post hoc explanations are increasingly used to understand the behavior of graph neural networks (GNNs), it becomes crucial to evaluate the quality and reliability of GNN explanations. However, assessing the quality of GNN explanations is challenging as existing graph datasets have no or unreliable ground-truth explanations for a given task. Here, we introduce a synthetic graph data generator, ShapeGGen, which can generate a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., varying graph sizes, degree distributions, homophilic vs. heterophilic graphs) accompanied by ground-truth explanations. Further, the flexibility to generate diverse synthetic datasets and corresponding ground-truth explanations allows us to mimic the data generated by various real-world applications. We include ShapeGGen and several real-world graph datasets into an open-source graph explainability library, GraphXAI. In addition to synthetic and real-world graph datasets with ground-truth explanations, GraphXAI provides data loaders, data processing functions, visualizers, GNN model implementations, and evaluation metrics to benchmark the performance of GNN explainability methods.

**Abstract:** Despite having achieved great success for sentiment analysis, existing neural models struggle with implicit sentiment analysis. This may be due to the fact that they may latch onto spurious correlations ("shortcuts", e.g., focusing only on explicit sentiment words), resulting in undermining the effectiveness and robustness of the learned model. In this work, we propose a causal intervention model for Implicit Sentiment Analysis using Instrumental Variable (ISAIV). We first review sentiment analysis from a causal perspective and analyze the confounders existing in this task. Then, we introduce an instrumental variable to eliminate the confounding causal effects, thus extracting the pure causal effect between sentence and sentiment. We compare the proposed ISAIV model with several strong baselines on both the general implicit sentiment analysis and aspect-based implicit sentiment analysis tasks. The results indicate the great advantages of our model and the efficacy of implicit sentiment reasoning.

**Abstract:** A reliable and efficient representation of multivariate time series is crucial in various downstream machine learning tasks. In multivariate time series forecasting, each variable depends on its historical values and there are inter-dependencies among variables as well. Models have to be designed to capture both intra- and inter-relationships among the time series. To move towards this goal, we propose the Time Series Attention Transformer (TSAT) for multivariate time series representation learning. Using TSAT, we represent both temporal information and inter-dependencies of multivariate time series in terms of edge-enhanced dynamic graphs. The intra-series correlations are represented by nodes in a dynamic graph; a self-attention mechanism is modified to capture the inter-series correlations by using the super-empirical mode decomposition (SMD) module. We applied the embedded dynamic graphs to times series forecasting problems, including two real-world datasets and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that TSAT clearly outerperforms six state-of-the-art baseline methods in various forecasting horizons. We further visualize the embedded dynamic graphs to illustrate the graph representation power of TSAT. We share our code at https://github.com/RadiantResearch/TSAT.

**Abstract:** In many applications, machine learned (ML) models are required to hold some invariance qualities, such as rotation, size, intensity, and background invariance. Unlike many types of variance, the variants of background scenes cannot be ordered easily, which makes it difficult to analyze the robustness and biases of the models concerned. In this work, we present a technical solution for ordering background scenes according to their semantic proximity to a target image that contains a foreground object being tested. We make use of the results of object recognition as the semantic description of each image, and construct an ontology for storing knowledge about relationships among different objects using association analysis. This ontology enables (i) efficient and meaningful search for background scenes of different semantic distances to a target image, (ii) quantitative control of the distribution and sparsity of the sampled background scenes, and (iii) quality assurance using visual representations of invariance testing results (referred to as variance matrices). In this paper, we also report the training of an ML4ML assessor to evaluate the invariance quality of ML models automatically.

**Abstract:** We study the Improving Multi-Armed Bandit (IMAB) problem, where the reward obtained from an arm increases with the number of pulls it receives. This model provides an elegant abstraction for many real-world problems in domains such as education and employment, where decisions about the distribution of opportunities can affect the future capabilities of communities and the disparity between them. A decision-maker in such settings must consider the impact of her decisions on future rewards in addition to the standard objective of maximizing her cumulative reward at any time. In many of these applications, the time horizon is unknown to the decision-maker beforehand, which motivates the study of the IMAB problem in the technically more challenging horizon-unaware setting. We study the tension that arises between two seemingly conflicting objectives in the horizon-unaware setting: a) maximizing the cumulative reward at any time based on current rewards of the arms, and b) ensuring that arms with better long-term rewards get sufficient opportunities even if they initially have low rewards. We show that, surprisingly, the two objectives are aligned with each other in this setting. Our main contribution is an anytime algorithm for the IMAB problem that achieves the best possible cumulative reward while ensuring that the arms reach their true potential given sufficient time. Our algorithm mitigates the initial disparity due to lack of opportunity and continues pulling an arm till it stops improving. We prove the optimality of our algorithm by showing that a) any algorithm for the IMAB problem, no matter how utilitarian, must suffer $Î©(T)$ policy regret and $Î©(k)$ competitive ratio with respect to the optimal offline policy, and b) the competitive ratio of our algorithm is $O(k)$.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection of multivariate time series is meaningful for system behavior monitoring. This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on unsupervised Short- and Long-term Mask Representation learning (SLMR). The main idea is to extract short-term local dependency patterns and long-term global trend patterns of the multivariate time series by using multi-scale residual dilated convolution and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) respectively. Furthermore, our approach can comprehend temporal contexts and feature correlations by combining spatial-temporal masked self-supervised representation learning and sequence split. It considers the importance of features is different, and we introduce the attention mechanism to adjust the contribution of each feature. Finally, a forecasting-based model and a reconstruction-based model are integrated to focus on single timestamp prediction and latent representation of time series. Experiments show that the performance of our method outperforms other state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets. Further analysis shows that our method is good at interpretability.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of best arm identification in a federated learning multi-armed bandit setup with a central server and multiple clients. Each client is associated with a multi-armed bandit in which each arm yields {\em i.i.d.}\ rewards following a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and known variance. The set of arms is assumed to be the same at all the clients. We define two notions of best arm -- local and global. The local best arm at a client is the arm with the largest mean among the arms local to the client, whereas the global best arm is the arm with the largest average mean across all the clients. We assume that each client can only observe the rewards from its local arms and thereby estimate its local best arm. The clients communicate with a central server on uplinks that entail a cost of $C\ge0$ units per usage per uplink. The global best arm is estimated at the server. The goal is to identify the local best arms and the global best arm with minimal total cost, defined as the sum of the total number of arm selections at all the clients and the total communication cost, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. We propose a novel algorithm {\sc FedElim} that is based on successive elimination and communicates only in exponential time steps and obtain a high probability instance-dependent upper bound on its total cost. The key takeaway from our paper is that for any $C\geq 0$ and error probabilities sufficiently small, the total number of arm selections (resp.\ the total cost) under {\sc FedElim} is at most~$2$ (resp.~$3$) times the maximum total number of arm selections under its variant that communicates in every time step. Additionally, we show that the latter is optimal in expectation up to a constant factor, thereby demonstrating that communication is almost cost-free in {\sc FedElim}. We numerically validate the efficacy of {\sc FedElim}.

**Abstract:** We apply post-processing to the class probability distribution outputs of audio event classification models and employ reinforcement learning to jointly discover the optimal parameters for various stages of a post-processing stack, such as the classification thresholds and the kernel sizes of median filtering algorithms used to smooth out model predictions. To achieve this we define a reinforcement learning environment where: 1) a state is the class probability distribution provided by the model for a given audio sample, 2) an action is the choice of a candidate optimal value for each parameter of the post-processing stack, 3) the reward is based on the classification accuracy metric we aim to optimize, which is the audio event-based macro F1-score in our case. We apply our post-processing to the class probability distribution outputs of two audio event classification models submitted to the DCASE Task4 2020 challenge. We find that by using reinforcement learning to discover the optimal per-class parameters for the post-processing stack that is applied to the outputs of audio event classification models, we can improve the audio event-based macro F1-score (the main metric used in the DCASE challenge to compare audio event classification accuracy) by 4-5% compared to using the same post-processing stack with manually tuned parameters.

**Abstract:** DNN-based video object detection (VOD) powers autonomous driving and video surveillance industries with rising importance and promising opportunities. However, adversarial patch attack yields huge concern in live vision tasks because of its practicality, feasibility, and powerful attack effectiveness. This work proposes Themis, a software/hardware system to defend against adversarial patches for real-time robust video object detection. We observe that adversarial patches exhibit extremely localized superficial feature importance in a small region with non-robust predictions, and thus propose the adversarial region detection algorithm for adversarial effect elimination. Themis also proposes a systematic design to efficiently support the algorithm by eliminating redundant computations and memory traffics. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology can effectively recover the system from the adversarial attack with negligible hardware overhead.

**Abstract:** Natural language understanding (NLU) is the task of semantic decoding of human languages by machines. NLU models rely heavily on large training data to ensure good performance. However, substantial languages and domains have very few data resources and domain experts. It is necessary to overcome the data scarcity challenge, when very few or even zero training samples are available. In this thesis, we focus on developing cross-lingual and cross-domain methods to tackle the low-resource issues. First, we propose to improve the model's cross-lingual ability by focusing on the task-related keywords, enhancing the model's robustness and regularizing the representations. We find that the representations for low-resource languages can be easily and greatly improved by focusing on just the keywords. Second, we present Order-Reduced Modeling methods for the cross-lingual adaptation, and find that modeling partial word orders instead of the whole sequence can improve the robustness of the model against word order differences between languages and task knowledge transfer to low-resource languages. Third, we propose to leverage different levels of domain-related corpora and additional masking of data in the pre-training for the cross-domain adaptation, and discover that more challenging pre-training can better address the domain discrepancy issue in the task knowledge transfer. Finally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework, Coach, and a cross-lingual and cross-domain parsing framework, X2Parser. Coach decomposes the representation learning process into a coarse-grained and a fine-grained feature learning, and X2Parser simplifies the hierarchical task structures into flattened ones. We observe that simplifying task structures makes the representation learning more effective for low-resource languages and domains.

**Abstract:** Methods of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are used in geoscientific applications to gain insights into the decision-making strategy of Neural Networks (NNs) highlighting which features in the input contribute the most to a NN prediction. Here, we discuss our lesson learned that the task of attributing a prediction to the input does not have a single solution. Instead, the attribution results and their interpretation depend greatly on the considered baseline (sometimes referred to as reference point) that the XAI method utilizes; a fact that has been overlooked so far in the literature. This baseline can be chosen by the user or it is set by construction in the method s algorithm, often without the user being aware of that choice. We highlight that different baselines can lead to different insights for different science questions and, thus, should be chosen accordingly. To illustrate the impact of the baseline, we use a large ensemble of historical and future climate simulations forced with the SSP3-7.0 scenario and train a fully connected NN to predict the ensemble- and global-mean temperature (i.e., the forced global warming signal) given an annual temperature map from an individual ensemble member. We then use various XAI methods and different baselines to attribute the network predictions to the input. We show that attributions differ substantially when considering different baselines, as they correspond to answering different science questions. We conclude by discussing some important implications and considerations about the use of baselines in XAI research.

**Abstract:** Multi-modal aspect-based sentiment classification (MABSC) is an emerging classification task that aims to classify the sentiment of a given target such as a mentioned entity in data with different modalities. In typical multi-modal data with text and image, previous approaches do not make full use of the fine-grained semantics of the image, especially in conjunction with the semantics of the text and do not fully consider modeling the relationship between fine-grained image information and target, which leads to insufficient use of image and inadequate to identify fine-grained aspects and opinions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new framework SeqCSG including a method to construct sequential cross-modal semantic graphs and an encoder-decoder model. Specifically, we extract fine-grained information from the original image, image caption, and scene graph, and regard them as elements of the cross-modal semantic graph as well as tokens from texts. The cross-modal semantic graph is represented as a sequence with a multi-modal visible matrix indicating relationships between elements. In order to effectively utilize the cross-modal semantic graph, we propose an encoder-decoder method with a target prompt template. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art on two standard datasets MABSC. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of each component and our model can implicitly learn the correlation between the target and fine-grained information of the image.

**Abstract:** Typical deep neural network (DNN) backdoor attacks are based on triggers embedded in inputs. Existing imperceptible triggers are computationally expensive or low in attack success. In this paper, we propose a new backdoor trigger, which is easy to generate, imperceptible, and highly effective. The new trigger is a uniformly randomly generated three-dimensional (3D) binary pattern that can be horizontally and/or vertically repeated and mirrored and superposed onto three-channel images for training a backdoored DNN model. Dispersed throughout an image, the new trigger produces weak perturbation to individual pixels, but collectively holds a strong recognizable pattern to train and activate the backdoor of the DNN. We also analytically reveal that the trigger is increasingly effective with the improving resolution of the images. Experiments are conducted using the ResNet-18 and MLP models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and BTSR datasets. In terms of imperceptibility, the new trigger outperforms existing triggers, such as BadNets, Trojaned NN, and Hidden Backdoor, by over an order of magnitude. The new trigger achieves an almost 100% attack success rate, only reduces the classification accuracy by less than 0.7%-2.4%, and invalidates the state-of-the-art defense techniques.

**Abstract:** We describe a local surrogate model for use in conjunction with global structure search methods. The model follows the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) formalism and is based on a the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor with sparsification in terms of a reduced number of local environments using mini-batch $k$-means. The model is implemented in the Atomistic Global Optimization X framework and used as a partial replacement of the local relaxations in basin hopping structure search. The approach is shown to be robust for a wide range of atomistic system including molecules, nano-particles, surface supported clusters and surface thin films. The benefits in a structure search context of a local surrogate model are demonstrated. This includes the ability to transfer learning from smaller systems as well as the possibility to perform concurrent multi-stoichiometry searches.

**Abstract:** Optional type annotations allow for enriching dynamic programming languages with static typing features like better Integrated Development Environment (IDE) support, more precise program analysis, and early detection and prevention of type-related runtime errors. Machine learning-based type inference promises interesting results for automating this task. However, the practical usage of such systems depends on their ability to generalize across different domains, as they are often applied outside their training domain. In this work, we investigate the generalization ability of Type4Py as a representative for state-of-the-art deep learning-based type inference systems, by conducting extensive cross-domain experiments. Thereby, we address the following problems: dataset shifts, out-of-vocabulary words, unknown classes, and rare classes. To perform such experiments, we use the datasets ManyTypes4Py and CrossDomainTypes4Py. The latter we introduce in this paper. Our dataset has over 1,000,000 type annotations and enables cross-domain evaluation of type inference systems in different domains of software projects using data from the two domains web development and scientific calculation. Through our experiments, we detect shifts in the dataset and that it has a long-tailed distribution with many rare and unknown data types which decreases the performance of the deep learning-based type inference system drastically. In this context, we test unsupervised domain adaptation methods and fine-tuning to overcome the issues. Moreover, we investigate the impact of out-of-vocabulary words.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a method using the fusion of CNN and transformer structure to improve image classification performance. In the case of CNN, information about a local area on an image can be extracted well, but there is a limit to the extraction of global information. On the other hand, the transformer has an advantage in relatively global extraction, but has a disadvantage in that it requires a lot of memory for local feature value extraction. In the case of an image, it is converted into a feature map through CNN, and each feature map's pixel is considered a token. At the same time, the image is divided into patch areas and then fused with the transformer method that views them as tokens. For the fusion of tokens with two different characteristics, we propose three methods: (1) late token fusion with parallel structure, (2) early token fusion, (3) token fusion in a layer by layer. In an experiment using ImageNet 1k, the proposed method shows the best classification performance.

**Abstract:** In response to the growing recognition of the social, legal, and ethical impacts of new AI-based technologies, major AI and ML conferences and journals now encourage or require submitted papers to include ethics impact statements and undergo ethics reviews. This move has sparked heated debate concerning the role of ethics in AI and data science research, at times devolving into counter-productive name-calling and threats of "cancellation." We argue that greater focus on the moral education of data scientists may help bridge the ideological divide separating the data science community. We diagnose this deep ideological conflict as one between atomists and holists. Among other things, atomists espouse the idea that facts are and should be kept separate from values, while holists believe facts and values are and should be inextricable from one another. With the goals of encouraging civil discourse across disciplines and reducing disciplinary polarization, we draw on a variety of historical sources ranging from philosophy and law, to social theory and humanistic psychology, to describe each ideology's beliefs and assumptions. Finally, we call on atomists and holists within the data science community to exhibit greater empathy during ethical disagreements and propose four targeted strategies to ensure data science research benefits society.

**Abstract:** With the spread of COVID-19 over the world, the need arose for fast and precise automatic triage mechanisms to decelerate the spread of the disease by reducing human efforts e.g. for image-based diagnosis. Although the literature has shown promising efforts in this direction, reported results do not consider the variability of CT scans acquired under varying circumstances, thus rendering resulting models unfit for use on data acquired using e.g. different scanner technologies. While COVID-19 diagnosis can now be done efficiently using PCR tests, this use case exemplifies the need for a methodology to overcome data variability issues in order to make medical image analysis models more widely applicable. In this paper, we explicitly address the variability issue using the example of COVID-19 diagnosis and propose a novel generative approach that aims at erasing the differences induced by e.g. the imaging technology while simultaneously introducing minimal changes to the CT scans through leveraging the idea of deep auto-encoders. The proposed prepossessing architecture (PrepNet) (i) is jointly trained on multiple CT scan datasets and (ii) is capable of extracting improved discriminative features for improved diagnosis. Experimental results on three public datasets (SARS-COVID-2, UCSD COVID-CT, MosMed) show that our model improves cross-dataset generalization by up to $11.84$ percentage points despite a minor drop in within dataset performance.

**Abstract:** Background and Objective: Existing deep learning platforms for medical image segmentation mainly focus on fully supervised segmentation that assumes full and accurate pixel-level annotations are available. We aim to develop a new deep learning toolkit to support annotation-efficient learning for medical image segmentation, which can accelerate and simply the development of deep learning models with limited annotation budget, e.g., learning from partial, sparse or noisy annotations.
  Methods: Our proposed toolkit named PyMIC is a modular deep learning platform for medical image segmentation tasks. In addition to basic components that support development of high-performance models for fully supervised segmentation, it contains several advanced components that are tailored for learning from imperfect annotations, such as loading annotated and unannounced images, loss functions for unannotated, partially or inaccurately annotated images, and training procedures for co-learning between multiple networks, etc. PyMIC is built on the PyTorch framework and supports development of semi-supervised, weakly supervised and noise-robust learning methods for medical image segmentation.
  Results: We present four illustrative medical image segmentation tasks based on PyMIC: (1) Achieving competitive performance on fully supervised learning; (2) Semi-supervised cardiac structure segmentation with only 10% training images annotated; (3) Weakly supervised segmentation using scribble annotations; and (4) Learning from noisy labels for chest radiograph segmentation.
  Conclusions: The PyMIC toolkit is easy to use and facilitates efficient development of medical image segmentation models with imperfect annotations. It is modular and flexible, which enables researchers to develop high-performance models with low annotation cost. The source code is available at: https://github.com/HiLab-git/PyMIC.

**Abstract:** Purpose: The localisation and segmentation of individual bones is an important preprocessing step in many planning and navigation applications. It is, however, a time-consuming and repetitive task if done manually. This is true not only for clinical practice but also for the acquisition of training data. We therefore not only present an end-to-end learnt algorithm that is capable of segmenting 125 distinct bones in an upper-body CT, but also provide an ensemble-based uncertainty measure that helps to single out scans to enlarge the training dataset with. Methods We create fully automated end-to-end learnt segmentations using a neural network architecture inspired by the 3D-Unet and fully supervised training. The results are improved using ensembles and inference-time augmentation. We examine the relationship of ensemble-uncertainty to an unlabelled scan's prospective usefulness as part of the training dataset. Results: Our methods are evaluated on an in-house dataset of 16 upper-body CT scans with a resolution of \SI{2}{\milli\meter} per dimension. Taking into account all 125 bones in our label set, our most successful ensemble achieves a median dice score coefficient of 0.83. We find a lack of correlation between a scan's ensemble uncertainty and its prospective influence on the accuracies achieved within an enlarged training set. At the same time, we show that the ensemble uncertainty correlates to the number of voxels that need manual correction after an initial automated segmentation, thus minimising the time required to finalise a new ground truth segmentation. Conclusion: In combination, scans with low ensemble uncertainty need less annotator time while yielding similar future DSC improvements. They are thus ideal candidates to enlarge a training set for upper-body distinct bone segmentation from CT scans. }
