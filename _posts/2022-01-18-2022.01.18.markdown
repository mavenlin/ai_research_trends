**Abstract:** As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly powerful and prominent in society, their misuse is a growing concern. In educational settings, AI technologies could be used by students to cheat on assignments and exams. In this paper we explore whether transformers can be used to solve introductory level programming assignments while bypassing commonly used AI tools to detect plagiarism. We find that a student using GPT-J [Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021] can complete introductory level programming assignments without triggering suspicion from MOSS [Aiken, 2000], a widely used plagiarism detection tool. This holds despite the fact that GPT-J was not trained on the problems in question and is not provided with any examples to work from. We further find that the code written by GPT-J is diverse in structure, lacking any particular tells that future plagiarism detection techniques may use to try to identify algorithmically generated code. We conclude with a discussion of the ethical and educational implications of large language models and directions for future research.

**Abstract:** Can world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) be used to act in interactive environments? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. "make breakfast"), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. "open fridge"). While prior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly find that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into low-level plans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable knowledge from language models.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose r-ssGPFA, an unsupervised online anomaly detection model for uni- and multivariate time series building on the efficient state space formulation of Gaussian processes. For high-dimensional time series, we propose an extension of Gaussian process factor analysis to identify the common latent processes of the time series, allowing us to detect anomalies efficiently in an interpretable manner. We gain explainability while speeding up computations by imposing an orthogonality constraint on the mapping from the latent to the observed. Our model's robustness is improved by using a simple heuristic to skip Kalman updates when encountering anomalous observations. We investigate the behaviour of our model on synthetic data and show on standard benchmark datasets that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while being computationally cheaper.

**Abstract:** Research on both natural intelligence (NI) and artificial intelligence (AI) generally assumes that the future resembles the past: intelligent agents or systems (what we call 'intelligence') observe and act on the world, then use this experience to act on future experiences of the same kind. We call this 'retrospective learning'. For example, an intelligence may see a set of pictures of objects, along with their names, and learn to name them. A retrospective learning intelligence would merely be able to name more pictures of the same objects. We argue that this is not what true intelligence is about. In many real world problems, both NIs and AIs will have to learn for an uncertain future. Both must update their internal models to be useful for future tasks, such as naming fundamentally new objects and using these objects effectively in a new context or to achieve previously unencountered goals. This ability to learn for the future we call 'prospective learning'. We articulate four relevant factors that jointly define prospective learning. Continual learning enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which it believes will be most useful in the future. Prospective constraints (including biases and priors) facilitate the intelligence finding general solutions that will be applicable to future problems. Curiosity motivates taking actions that inform future decision making, including in previously unmet situations. Causal estimation enables learning the structure of relations that guide choosing actions for specific outcomes, even when the specific action-outcome contingencies have never been observed before. We argue that a paradigm shift from retrospective to prospective learning will enable the communities that study intelligence to unite and overcome existing bottlenecks to more effectively explain, augment, and engineer intelligences.

**Abstract:** Future Event Generation aims to generate fluent and reasonable future event descriptions given preceding events. It requires not only fluent text generation but also commonsense reasoning to maintain the coherence of the entire event story. However, existing FEG methods are easily trapped into repeated or general events without imposing any logical constraint to the generation process. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable FEG framework that consists of a commonsense inference model (IM) and an event generation model (GM). The IM, which is pre-trained on a commonsense knowledge graph ATOMIC, learns to interpret the preceding events and conducts commonsense reasoning to reveal the characters psychology such as intent, reaction, and needs as latent variables. GM further takes the commonsense knowledge as prompts to guide and enforce the generation of logistically coherent future events. As unique merit, the commonsense prompts can be further decoded into textual descriptions, yielding explanations for the future event. Automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that our approach can generate more coherent, specific, and logical future events than the strong baselines.

**Abstract:** Current AI systems lack several important human capabilities, such as adaptability, generalizability, self-control, consistency, common sense, and causal reasoning. We believe that existing cognitive theories of human decision making, such as the thinking fast and slow theory, can provide insights on how to advance AI systems towards some of these capabilities. In this paper, we propose a general architecture that is based on fast/slow solvers and a metacognitive component. We then present experimental results on the behavior of an instance of this architecture, for AI systems that make decisions about navigating in a constrained environment. We show how combining the fast and slow decision modalities allows the system to evolve over time and gradually pass from slow to fast thinking with enough experience, and that this greatly helps in decision quality, resource consumption, and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Histopathological image analysis is the gold standard to diagnose cancer. Carcinoma is a subtype of cancer that constitutes more than 80% of all cancer cases. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are two major subtypes of carcinoma, diagnosed by microscopic study of biopsy slides. However, manual microscopic evaluation is a subjective and time-consuming process. Many researchers have reported methods to automate carcinoma detection and classification. The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the automation of carcinoma diagnosis also reveals a significant rise in the use of deep network models. In this systematic literature review, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art approaches reported in carcinoma diagnosis using histopathological images. Studies are selected from well-known databases with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. We have categorized the articles and recapitulated their methods based on specific organs of carcinoma origin. Further, we have summarized pertinent literature on AI methods, highlighted critical challenges and limitations, and provided insights on future research direction in automated carcinoma diagnosis. Out of 101 articles selected, most of the studies experimented on private datasets with varied image sizes, obtaining accuracy between 63% and 100%. Overall, this review highlights the need for a generalized AI-based carcinoma diagnostic system. Additionally, it is desirable to have accountable approaches to extract microscopic features from images of multiple magnifications that should mimic pathologists' evaluations.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks are typically trained in a single shot for a specific task and data distribution, but in real world settings both the task and the domain of application can change. The problem becomes even more challenging in dense predictive tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and furthermore most approaches tackle the two problems separately. In this paper we introduce the novel task of coarse-to-fine learning of semantic segmentation architectures in presence of domain shift. We consider subsequent learning stages progressively refining the task at the semantic level; i.e., the finer set of semantic labels at each learning step is hierarchically derived from the coarser set of the previous step. We propose a new approach (CCDA) to tackle this scenario. First, we employ the maximum squares loss to align source and target domains and, at the same time, to balance the gradients between well-classified and harder samples. Second, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine knowledge distillation constraint to transfer network capabilities acquired on a coarser set of labels to a set of finer labels. Finally, we design a coarse-to-fine weight initialization rule to spread the importance from each coarse class to the respective finer classes. To evaluate our approach, we design two benchmarks where source knowledge is extracted from the GTA5 dataset and it is transferred to either the Cityscapes or the IDD datasets, and we show how it outperforms the main competitors.

**Abstract:** We study the global convergence of policy gradient for infinite-horizon, continuous state and action space, entropy-regularized Markov decision processes (MDPs). We consider a softmax policy with (one-hidden layer) neural network approximation in a mean-field regime. Additional entropic regularization in the associated mean-field probability measure is added, and the corresponding gradient flow is studied in the 2-Wasserstein metric. We show that the objective function is increasing along the gradient flow. Further, we prove that if the regularization in terms of the mean-field measure is sufficient, the gradient flow converges exponentially fast to the unique stationary solution, which is the unique maximizer of the regularized MDP objective. Lastly, we study the sensitivity of the value function along the gradient flow with respect to regularization parameters and the initial condition. Our results rely on the careful analysis of non-linear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation and extend the pioneering work of Mei et al. 2020 and Agarwal et al. 2020, which quantify the global convergence rate of policy gradient for entropy-regularized MDPs in the tabular setting.

**Abstract:** Recommender systems provide essential web services by learning users' personal preferences from collected data. However, in many cases, systems also need to forget some training data. From the perspective of privacy, several privacy regulations have recently been proposed, requiring systems to eliminate any impact of the data whose owner requests to forget. From the perspective of utility, if a system's utility is damaged by some bad data, the system needs to forget these data to regain utility. From the perspective of usability, users can delete noise and incorrect entries so that a system can provide more useful recommendations. While unlearning is very important, it has not been well-considered in existing recommender systems. Although there are some researches have studied the problem of machine unlearning in the domains of image and text data, existing methods can not been directly applied to recommendation as they are unable to consider the collaborative information.
  In this paper, we propose RecEraser, a general and efficient machine unlearning framework tailored to recommendation task. The main idea of RecEraser is to partition the training set into multiple shards and train a constituent model for each shard. Specifically, to keep the collaborative information of the data, we first design three novel data partition algorithms to divide training data into balanced groups based on their similarity. Then, considering that different shard models do not uniformly contribute to the final prediction, we further propose an adaptive aggregation method to improve the global model utility. Experimental results on three public benchmarks show that RecEraser can not only achieve efficient unlearning, but also outperform the state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of model utility.

**Abstract:** Online learning is an important technical means for sketching massive real-time and high-speed data. Although this direction has attracted intensive attention, most of the literature in this area ignore the following three issues: (1) they think little of the underlying abstract hierarchical latent information existing in examples, even if extracting these abstract hierarchical latent representations is useful to better predict the class labels of examples; (2) the idea of preassigned model on unseen datapoints is not suitable for modeling streaming data with evolving probability distribution. This challenge is referred as model flexibility. And so, with this in minds, the online deep learning model we need to design should have a variable underlying structure; (3) moreover, it is of utmost importance to fusion these abstract hierarchical latent representations to achieve better classification performance, and we should give different weights to different levels of implicit representation information when dealing with the data streaming where the data distribution changes. To address these issues, we propose a two-phase Online Deep Learning based on Auto-Encoder (ODLAE). Based on auto-encoder, considering reconstruction loss, we extract abstract hierarchical latent representations of instances; Based on predictive loss, we devise two fusion strategies: the output-level fusion strategy, which is obtained by fusing the classification results of encoder each hidden layer; and feature-level fusion strategy, which is leveraged self-attention mechanism to fusion every hidden layer output. Finally, in order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, we also try to utilize the denoising auto-encoder to yield hierarchical latent representations. Experimental results on different datasets are presented to verify the validity of our proposed algorithm (ODLAE) outperforms several baselines.

**Abstract:** Heterogeneous catalysts possess complex surface and bulk structures, relatively poor intrinsic contrast, and often a sparse distribution of the catalytic nanoparticles (NPs), posing a significant challenge for image segmentation, including the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. To tackle this problem, we apply a deep learning-based approach for the multi-class semantic segmentation of a $Œ≥$-Alumina/Pt catalytic material in a class imbalance situation. Specifically, we used the weighted focal loss as a loss function and attached it to the U-Net's fully convolutional network architecture. We assessed the accuracy of our results using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, precision, and Hausdorff distance (HD) metrics on the overlap between the ground-truth and predicted segmentations. Our adopted U-Net model with the weighted focal loss function achieved an average DSC score of 0.96 $\pm$ 0.003 in the $Œ≥$-Alumina support material and 0.84 $\pm$ 0.03 in the Pt NPs segmentation tasks. We report an average boundary-overlap error of less than 2 nm at the 90th percentile of HD for $Œ≥$-Alumina and Pt NPs segmentations. The complex surface morphology of the $Œ≥$-Alumina and its relation to the Pt NPs were visualized in 3D by the deep learning-assisted automatic segmentation of a large data set of high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography reconstructions.

**Abstract:** Real-time object pose estimation is necessary for many robot manipulation algorithms. However, state-of-the-art methods for object pose estimation are trained for a specific set of objects; these methods thus need to be retrained to estimate the pose of each new object, often requiring tens of GPU-days of training for optimal performance. \revisef{In this paper, we propose the OSSID framework,} leveraging a slow zero-shot pose estimator to self-supervise the training of a fast detection algorithm. This fast detector can then be used to filter the input to the pose estimator, drastically improving its inference speed. We show that this self-supervised training exceeds the performance of existing zero-shot detection methods on two widely used object pose estimation and detection datasets, without requiring any human annotations. Further, we show that the resulting method for pose estimation has a significantly faster inference speed, due to the ability to filter out large parts of the image. Thus, our method for self-supervised online learning of a detector (trained using pseudo-labels from a slow pose estimator) leads to accurate pose estimation at real-time speeds, without requiring human annotations.

**Abstract:** Open source machine learning (ML) libraries allow developers to integrate advanced ML functionality into their own applications. However, popular ML libraries, such as TensorFlow, are not available natively in all programming languages and software package ecosystems. Hence, developers who wish to use an ML library which is not available in their programming language or ecosystem of choice, may need to resort to using a so-called binding library. Binding libraries provide support across programming languages and package ecosystems for a source library. For example, the Keras .NET binding provides support for the Keras library in the NuGet (.NET) ecosystem even though the Keras library was written in Python. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of 155 cross-ecosystem bindings and their development for 36 popular open source ML libraries. Our study shows that for most popular ML libraries, only one package ecosystem is officially supported (usually PyPI). Cross-ecosystem support, which is available for 25% of the studied ML libraries, is usually provided through community-maintained bindings, e.g., 73% of the bindings in the npm ecosystem are community-maintained. Our study shows that the vast majority of the studied bindings cover only a small portion of the source library releases, and the delay for receiving support for a source library release is large.

**Abstract:** Advances in parallel and distributed computing have enabled efficient implementation of the distributed swarm and evolutionary algorithms for complex and computationally expensive models. Evolutionary algorithms provide gradient-free optimisation which is beneficial for models that do not have such information available, for instance, geoscientific landscape evolution models. However, such models are so computationally expensive that even distributed swarm and evolutionary algorithms with the power of parallel computing struggle. We need to incorporate efficient strategies such as surrogate assisted optimisation that further improves their performance; however, this becomes a challenge given parallel processing and inter-process communication for implementing surrogate training and prediction. In this paper, we implement surrogate-based estimation of fitness evaluation in distributed swarm optimisation over a parallel computing architecture. Our results demonstrate very promising results for benchmark functions and geoscientific landscape evolution models. We obtain a reduction in computationally time while retaining optimisation solution accuracy through the use of surrogates in a parallel computing environment.

**Abstract:** A successful deep learning model is dependent on extensive training data and processing power and time (known as training costs). There exist many tasks without enough number of labeled data to train a deep learning model. Further, the demand is rising for running deep learning models on edge devices with limited processing capacity and training time. Deep transfer learning (DTL) methods are the answer to tackle such limitations, e.g., fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a massive semi-related dataset proved to be a simple and effective method for many problems. DTLs handle limited target data concerns as well as drastically reduce the training costs. In this paper, the definition and taxonomy of deep transfer learning is reviewed. Then we focus on the sub-category of network-based DTLs since it is the most common types of DTLs that have been applied to various applications in the last decade.

**Abstract:** Traditionally, distributed machine learning takes the guise of (i) different nodes training the same model (as in federated learning), or (ii) one model being split among multiple nodes (as in distributed stochastic gradient descent). In this work, we highlight how fog- and IoT-based scenarios often require combining both approaches, and we present a framework for flexible parallel learning (FPL), achieving both data and model parallelism. Further, we investigate how different ways of distributing and parallelizing learning tasks across the participating nodes result in different computation, communication, and energy costs. Our experiments, carried out using state-of-the-art deep-network architectures and large-scale datasets, confirm that FPL allows for an excellent trade-off among computational (hence energy) cost, communication overhead, and learning performance.

**Abstract:** With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound has emerged as an effective tool for bedside monitoring of patients. Due to this, a large amount of lung ultrasound scans have been made available which can be used for AI based diagnosis and analysis. Several AI-based patient severity scoring models have been proposed that rely on scoring the appearance of the ultrasound scans. AI models are trained using ultrasound-appearance severity scores that are manually labeled based on standardized visual features. We address the challenge of labeling every ultrasound frame in the video clips. Our contrastive learning method treats the video clip severity labels as noisy weak severity labels for individual frames, thus requiring only video-level labels. We show that it performs better than the conventional cross-entropy loss based training. We combine frame severity predictions to come up with video severity predictions and show that the frame based model achieves comparable performance to a video based TSM model, on a large dataset combining public and private sources.

**Abstract:** We implement a divide-and-concur iterative projection approach to context-free grammar inference. Unlike most state-of-the-art models of natural language processing, our method requires a relatively small number of discrete parameters, making the inferred grammar directly interpretable -- one can read off from a solution how to construct grammatically valid sentences. Another advantage of our approach is the ability to infer meaningful grammatical rules from just a few sentences, compared to the hundreds of gigabytes of training data many other models employ. We demonstrate several ways of applying our approach: classifying words and inferring a grammar from scratch, taking an existing grammar and refining its categories and rules, and taking an existing grammar and expanding its lexicon as it encounters new words in new data.

**Abstract:** Submodular functions are at the core of many machine learning and data mining tasks. The underlying submodular functions for many of these tasks are decomposable, i.e., they are sum of several simple submodular functions. In many data intensive applications, however, the number of underlying submodular functions in the original function is so large that we need prohibitively large amount of time to process it and/or it does not even fit in the main memory. To overcome this issue, we introduce the notion of sparsification for decomposable submodular functions whose objective is to obtain an accurate approximation of the original function that is a (weighted) sum of only a few submodular functions. Our main result is a polynomial-time randomized sparsification algorithm such that the expected number of functions used in the output is independent of the number of underlying submodular functions in the original function. We also study the effectiveness of our algorithm under various constraints such as matroid and cardinality constraints. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study of the performance of our algorithm.

**Abstract:** Safety exploration can be regarded as a constrained Markov decision problem where the expected long-term cost is constrained. Previous off-policy algorithms convert the constrained optimization problem into the corresponding unconstrained dual problem by introducing the Lagrangian relaxation technique. However, the cost function of the above algorithms provides inaccurate estimations and causes the instability of the Lagrange multiplier learning. In this paper, we present a novel off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm called Conservative Distributional Maximum a Posteriori Policy Optimization (CDMPO). At first, to accurately judge whether the current situation satisfies the constraints, CDMPO adapts distributional reinforcement learning method to estimate the Q-function and C-function. Then, CDMPO uses a conservative value function loss to reduce the number of violations of constraints during the exploration process. In addition, we utilize Weighted Average Proportional Integral Derivative (WAPID) to update the Lagrange multiplier stably. Empirical results show that the proposed method has fewer violations of constraints in the early exploration process. The final test results also illustrate that our method has better risk control.

**Abstract:** Arguably the most fundamental question in the theory of generative adversarial networks (GANs) is to understand to what extent GANs can actually learn the underlying distribution. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests local optimality of the empirical training objective is insufficient. Yet, it does not rule out the possibility that achieving a true population minimax optimal solution might imply distribution learning.
  In this paper, we show that standard cryptographic assumptions imply that this stronger condition is still insufficient. Namely, we show that if local pseudorandom generators (PRGs) exist, then for a large family of natural continuous target distributions, there are ReLU network generators of constant depth and polynomial size which take Gaussian random seeds so that (i) the output is far in Wasserstein distance from the target distribution, but (ii) no polynomially large Lipschitz discriminator ReLU network can detect this. This implies that even achieving a population minimax optimal solution to the Wasserstein GAN objective is likely insufficient for distribution learning in the usual statistical sense. Our techniques reveal a deep connection between GANs and PRGs, which we believe will lead to further insights into the computational landscape of GANs.

**Abstract:** The maritime industry is experiencing a technological revolution that affects shipbuilding, operation of both seagoing and inland vessels, cargo management, and working practices in harbors. This ongoing transformation is driven by the ambition to make the ecosystem more sustainable and cost-efficient. Digitalization and automation help achieve these goals by transforming shipping and cruising into a much more cost- and energy-efficient, and decarbonized industry segment. The key enablers in these processes are always-available connectivity and content delivery services, which can not only aid shipping companies in improving their operational efficiency and reducing carbon emissions but also contribute to enhanced crew welfare and passenger experience. Due to recent advancements in integrating high-capacity and ultra-reliable terrestrial and non-terrestrial networking technologies, ubiquitous maritime connectivity is becoming a reality. To cope with the increased complexity of managing these integrated systems, this article advocates the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based approaches to meet the service requirements and energy efficiency targets in various maritime communications scenarios.

**Abstract:** In an aerial hybrid massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, how to design a spectral-efficient broadband multi-user hybrid beamforming with a limited pilot and feedback overhead is challenging. To this end, by modeling the key transmission modules as an end-to-end (E2E) neural network, this paper proposes a data-driven deep learning (DL)-based unified hybrid beamforming framework for both the time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) systems with implicit channel state information (CSI). For TDD systems, the proposed DL-based approach jointly models the uplink pilot combining and downlink hybrid beamforming modules as an E2E neural network. While for FDD systems, we jointly model the downlink pilot transmission, uplink CSI feedback, and downlink hybrid beamforming modules as an E2E neural network. Different from conventional approaches separately processing different modules, the proposed solution simultaneously optimizes all modules with the sum rate as the optimization object. Therefore, by perceiving the inherent property of air-to-ground massive MIMO-OFDM channel samples, the DL-based E2E neural network can establish the mapping function from the channel to the beamformer, so that the explicit channel reconstruction can be avoided with reduced pilot and feedback overhead. Besides, practical low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) introduce the quantization constraint, leading to the intractable gradient backpropagation when training the neural network. To mitigate the performance loss caused by the phase quantization error, we adopt the transfer learning strategy to further fine-tune the E2E neural network based on a pre-trained network that assumes the ideal infinite-resolution PSs. Numerical results show that our DL-based schemes have considerable advantages over state-of-the-art schemes.

**Abstract:** Since severe droughts are occurring more frequently and lengthening the dry season in the Amazon Rainforest, it is important to respond to active wildfires promptly and to forecast them before they become inextinguishable. Though computer vision researchers have applied algorithms on large databases to automatically detect wildfires, current models are computationally expensive and are not versatile enough for the low technology conditions of regions in South America. This comprehensive deep learning study first trains a Fully Convolutional Neural Network with skip connections on multispectral Landsat 8 images of Ecuador and the Galapagos. The model uses Green and Short-wave Infrared bands as inputs to predict each image's corresponding pixel-level binary fire mask. This model achieves a 0.962 validation F2 score and a 0.932 F2 score on test data from Guyana and Suriname. Afterward, image segmentation is conducted on the Cirrus Cloud band using K-Means Clustering to simplify continuous pixel values into three discrete classes representing the degree of cirrus cloud contamination. Two additional Convolutional Neural Networks are trained to classify the presence of a wildfire in a patch of land using these segmented cirrus images. The "experimental" model trained on the segmented inputs achieves 96.5% binary accuracy and has smoother learning curves than the "control model" that is not given the segmented inputs. This proof of concept reveals that feature simplification can improve the performance of wildfire detection models. Overall, the software built in this study is useful for early and accurate detection of wildfires in South America.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the significance of the pleura and adipose tissue in lung ultrasound AI analysis. We highlight their more prominent appearance when using high-frequency linear (HFL) instead of curvilinear ultrasound probes, showing HFL reveals better pleura detail. We compare the diagnostic utility of the pleura and adipose tissue using an HFL ultrasound probe. Masking the adipose tissue during training and inference (while retaining the pleural line and Merlin's space artifacts such as A-lines and B-lines) improved the AI model's diagnostic accuracy.

**Abstract:** Well-labeled datasets of chest radiographs (CXRs) are difficult to acquire due to the high cost of annotation. Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and transferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that lack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain prior; e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19, manifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical structure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the influence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream prognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a generative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns factorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the structure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized to generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but inherits the lung texture of another. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled texture representation, we evaluate the texture encoder $Enc^t$ in LSAE on ChestX-ray14 (N=112,120), and our own multi-institutional COVID-19 outcome prediction dataset, COVOC (N=340 (Subset-1) + 53 (Subset-2)). On both datasets, we reach or surpass the state-of-the-art by finetuning $Enc^t$ in LSAE that is 77% smaller than a baseline Inception v3. Additionally, in semi-and-self supervised settings with a similar model budget, $Enc^t$ in LSAE is also competitive with the state-of-the-art MoCo. By "re-mixing" the texture and shape factors, we generate meaningful hybrid images that can augment the training set. This data augmentation method can further improve COVOC prediction performance. The improvement is consistent even when we directly evaluate the Subset-1 trained model on Subset-2 without any fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** Algorithms that aid human tasks, such as recommendation systems, are ubiquitous. They appear in everything from social media to streaming videos to online shopping. However, the feedback loop between people and algorithms is poorly understood and can amplify cognitive and social biases (algorithmic confounding), leading to unexpected outcomes. In this work, we explore algorithmic confounding in collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithms through teacher-student learning simulations. Namely, a student collaborative filtering-based model, trained on simulated choices, is used by the recommendation algorithm to recommend items to agents. Agents might choose some of these items, according to an underlying teacher model, with new choices then fed back into the student model as new training data (approximating online machine learning). These simulations demonstrate how algorithmic confounding produces erroneous recommendations which in turn lead to instability, i.e., wide variations in an item's popularity between each simulation realization. We use the simulations to demonstrate a novel approach to training collaborative filtering models that can create more stable and accurate recommendations. Our methodology is general enough that it can be extended to other socio-technical systems in order to better quantify and improve the stability of algorithms. These results highlight the need to account for emergent behaviors from interactions between people and algorithms.

**Abstract:** In online marketing, the advertisers' goal is usually a tradeoff between achieving high volumes and high profitability. The companies' business units customarily address this tradeoff by maximizing the volumes while guaranteeing a lower bound to the Return On Investment (ROI). This paper investigates combinatorial bandit algorithms for the bid optimization of advertising campaigns subject to uncertain budget and ROI constraints. We study the nature of both the optimization and learning problems. In particular, when focusing on the optimization problem without uncertainty, we show that it is inapproximable within any factor unless P=NP, and we provide a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm that achieves an optimal solution. When considering uncertainty, we prove that no online learning algorithm can violate the (ROI or budget) constraints during the learning process a sublinear number of times while guaranteeing a sublinear pseudo-regret. Thus, we provide an algorithm, namely GCB, guaranteeing sublinear regret at the cost of a potentially linear number of constraints violations. We also design its safe version, namely GCB_{safe}, guaranteeing w.h.p. a constant upper bound on the number of constraints violations at the cost of a linear pseudo-regret. More interestingly, we provide an algorithm, namely GCB_{safe}(œà,œÜ), guaranteeing both sublinear pseudo-regret and safety w.h.p. at the cost of accepting tolerances œàand œÜin the satisfaction of the ROI and budget constraints, respectively. This algorithm actually mitigates the risks due to the constraints violations without precluding the convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we experimentally compare our algorithms in terms of pseudo-regret/constraint-violation tradeoff in settings generated from real-world data, showing the importance of adopting safety constraints in practice and the effectiveness of our algorithms.

**Abstract:** Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) are very popular methods in machine learning and have been applied very successfully to the prediction of the properties of molecules and materials. First-order GCNNs are well known to be incomplete, i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen through the lens of the GCNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem. The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph representation for the molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a bond between each pair of atoms within a certain preselected cutoff. Bonds can be decorated with the distance between atoms, and the resulting "distance graph convolution NNs" (dGCNN) have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in chemical ML. Here we show that even for the restricted case of graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGCNNs are not complete. We construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs that, for any cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test. This class of degenerate structures includes chemically-plausible configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the expressive power of some of the well-established GCNN architectures for atomistic machine learning. Models that explicitly use angular information in the description of atomic environments can resolve these degeneracies.

**Abstract:** Lesions or organ boundaries visible through medical imaging data are often ambiguous, thus resulting in significant variations in multi-reader delineations, i.e., the source of aleatoric uncertainty. In particular, quantifying the inter-observer variability of manual annotations with Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging data plays a crucial role in establishing a reference standard for various diagnosis and treatment tasks. Most segmentation methods, however, simply model a mapping from an image to its single segmentation map and do not take the disagreement of annotators into consideration. In order to account for inter-observer variability, without sacrificing accuracy, we propose a novel variational inference framework to model the distribution of plausible segmentation maps, given a specific MR image, which explicitly represents the multi-reader variability. Specifically, we resort to a latent vector to encode the multi-reader variability and counteract the inherent information loss in the imaging data. Then, we apply a variational autoencoder network and optimize its evidence lower bound (ELBO) to efficiently approximate the distribution of the segmentation map, given an MR image. Experimental results, carried out with the QUBIQ brain growth MRI segmentation datasets with seven annotators, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

**Abstract:** Traditionally, the performance of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms are demonstrated and validated in gaming environments where we often have a fixed number of agents. In many industrial applications, the number of available agents can change at any given day and even when the number of agents is known ahead of time, it is common for an agent to break during the operation and become unavailable for a period of time. In this paper, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-agent collaborative tasks with a variable number of agents. We demonstrate the application of our algorithm using a fleet management simulator developed by Hitachi to generate realistic scenarios in a production site.

**Abstract:** Reward learning enables robots to learn adaptable behaviors from human input. Traditional methods model the reward as a linear function of hand-crafted features, but that requires specifying all the relevant features a priori, which is impossible for real-world tasks. To get around this issue, recent deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods learn rewards directly from the raw state but this is challenging because the robot has to implicitly learn the features that are important and how to combine them, simultaneously. Instead, we propose a divide and conquer approach: focus human input specifically on learning the features separately, and only then learn how to combine them into a reward. We introduce a novel type of human input for teaching features and an algorithm that utilizes it to learn complex features from the raw state space. The robot can then learn how to combine them into a reward using demonstrations, corrections, or other reward learning frameworks. We demonstrate our method in settings where all features have to be learned from scratch, as well as where some of the features are known. By first focusing human input specifically on the feature(s), our method decreases sample complexity and improves generalization of the learned reward over a deepIRL baseline. We show this in experiments with a physical 7DOF robot manipulator, as well as in a user study conducted in a simulated environment.

**Abstract:** Learning informative representations from image-based observations is of fundamental concern in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, data-inefficiency remains a significant barrier to this objective. To overcome this obstacle, we propose to accelerate state representation learning by enforcing view-consistency on the dynamics. Firstly, we introduce a formalism of Multi-view Markov Decision Process (MMDP) that incorporates multiple views of the state. Following the structure of MMDP, our method, View-Consistent Dynamics (VCD), learns state representations by training a view-consistent dynamics model in the latent space, where views are generated by applying data augmentation to states. Empirical evaluation on DeepMind Control Suite and Atari-100k demonstrates VCD to be the SoTA data-efficient algorithm on visual control tasks.

**Abstract:** Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. The availability of a robust automated cervical image classification system can augment the clinical care provider's limitation in traditional visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). However, there are a wide variety of cervical inspection objectives which impact the labeling criteria for criteria-specific prediction model development. Moreover, due to the lack of confirmatory test results and inter-rater labeling variation, many images are left unlabeled.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) based approach to produce a pre-trained cervix model from unlabeled cervical images. The developed model is further fine-tuned to produce criteria-specific classification models with the available labeled images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using two cervical image datasets. Both datasets are partially labeled and labeling criteria are different. The experimental results show that the SSL-based initialization improves classification performance (Accuracy: 2.5% min) and the inclusion of images from both datasets during SSL further improves the performance (Accuracy: 1.5% min). Further, considering data-sharing restrictions, we experimented with the effectiveness of Federated SSL and find that it can improve performance over the SSL model developed with just its images. This justifies the importance of SSL-based cervix model development. We believe that the present research shows a novel direction in developing criteria-specific custom deep models for cervical image classification by combining images from different sources unlabeled and/or labeled with varying criteria, and addressing image access restrictions.

**Abstract:** Recently, self-supervised vision transformers have attracted unprecedented attention for their impressive representation learning ability. However, the dominant method, contrastive learning, mainly relies on an instance discrimination pretext task, which learns a global understanding of the image. This paper incorporates local feature learning into self-supervised vision transformers via Reconstructive Pre-training (RePre). Our RePre extends contrastive frameworks by adding a branch for reconstructing raw image pixels in parallel with the existing contrastive objective. RePre is equipped with a lightweight convolution-based decoder that fuses the multi-hierarchy features from the transformer encoder. The multi-hierarchy features provide rich supervisions from low to high semantic information, which are crucial for our RePre. Our RePre brings decent improvements on various contrastive frameworks with different vision transformer architectures. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised counterparts.

**Abstract:** Knowledge of the changing traffic is critical in risk management. Customs offices worldwide have traditionally relied on local resources to accumulate knowledge and detect tax fraud. This naturally poses countries with weak infrastructure to become tax havens of potentially illicit trades. The current paper proposes DAS, a memory bank platform to facilitate knowledge sharing across multi-national customs administrations to support each other. We propose a domain adaptation method to share transferable knowledge of frauds as prototypes while safeguarding the local trade information. Data encompassing over 8 million import declarations have been used to test the feasibility of this new system, which shows that participating countries may benefit up to 2-11 times in fraud detection with the help of shared knowledge. We discuss implications for substantial tax revenue potential and strengthened policy against illicit trades.

**Abstract:** Diacritics restoration has become a ubiquitous task in the Latin-alphabet-based English-dominated Internet language environment. In this paper, we describe a small footprint 1D dilated convolution-based approach which operates on a character-level. We find that solutions based on 1D dilated convolutional neural networks are competitive alternatives to models based on recursive neural networks or linguistic modeling for the task of diacritics restoration. Our solution surpasses the performance of similarly sized models and is also competitive with larger models. A special feature of our solution is that it even runs locally in a web browser. We also provide a working example of this browser-based implementation. Our model is evaluated on different corpora, with emphasis on the Hungarian language. We performed comparative measurements about the generalization power of the model in relation to three Hungarian corpora. We also analyzed the errors to understand the limitation of corpus-based self-supervised training.

Besides this notion of popularity, we use a measure of similarity between nodes quantified by a normalized count of their common neighbours to improve the model. Finally, we show that the model can be further improved by considering a time-weighted adjacency matrix with both older and newer links having higher impact in the predictions, representing rooted concepts and state of the art research, respectively.

**Abstract:** Image-based anomaly detection systems are of vital importance in various manufacturing applications. The resolution and acquisition rate of such systems is increasing significantly in recent years under the fast development of image sensing technology. This enables the detection of tiny defects in real-time. However, such a high resolution and acquisition rate of image data not only slows down the speed of image processing algorithms but also increases data storage and transmission cost. To tackle this problem, we propose a fast and data-efficient method with theoretical performance guarantee that is suitable for sparse anomaly detection in images with a smooth background (smooth plus sparse signal). The proposed method, named Compressed Smooth Sparse Decomposition (CSSD), is a one-step method that unifies the compressive image acquisition and decomposition-based image processing techniques. To further enhance its performance in a high-dimensional scenario, a Kronecker Compressed Smooth Sparse Decomposition (KronCSSD) method is proposed. Compared to traditional smooth and sparse decomposition algorithms, significant transmission cost reduction and computational speed boost can be achieved with negligible performance loss. Simulation examples and several case studies in various applications illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

**Abstract:** Behavioral Indicators of Compromise are associated with various automated methods used to extract the sample behavior by observing the system function calls performed in a virtual execution environment. Thus, every sample is described by a set of BICs triggered by the sample behavior in the sandbox environment. Here we discuss a Machine Learning approach to the classification of the sandbox samples as MALICIOUS or BENIGN, based on the list of triggered BICs. Besides the more traditional methods like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classification we also discuss a different approach inspired by the statistical Monte Carlo methods. The numerical results are illustrated using ThreatGRID and ReversingLabs data.

**Abstract:** We introduce a tensor-based model of shared representation for meta-learning from a diverse set of tasks. Prior works on learning linear representations for meta-learning assume that there is a common shared representation across different tasks, and do not consider the additional task-specific observable side information. In this work, we model the meta-parameter through an order-$3$ tensor, which can adapt to the observed task features of the task. We propose two methods to estimate the underlying tensor. The first method solves a tensor regression problem and works under natural assumptions on the data generating process. The second method uses the method of moments under additional distributional assumptions and has an improved sample complexity in terms of the number of tasks.
  We also focus on the meta-test phase, and consider estimating task-specific parameters on a new task. Substituting the estimated tensor from the first step allows us estimating the task-specific parameters with very few samples of the new task, thereby showing the benefits of learning tensor representations for meta-learning. Finally, through simulation and several real-world datasets, we evaluate our methods and show that it improves over previous linear models of shared representations for meta-learning.

**Abstract:** We leverage representation learning and the inductive bias in neural-net-based Standard Model jet classification tasks, to detect non-QCD signal jets. In establishing the framework for classification-based anomaly detection in jet physics, we demonstrate that with a \emph{well-calibrated} and \emph{powerful enough feature extractor}, a well-trained \emph{mass-decorrelated} supervised neural jet tagger can serve as a strong generic anti-QCD jet tagger for effectively reducing the QCD background. Imposing \emph{data-augmented} mass-invariance (decoupling the dominant factor) not only facilitates background estimation, but also induces more substructure-aware representation learning. We are able to reach excellent tagging efficiencies for all the test signals considered. In the best case, we reach a background rejection rate around 50 and a significance improvement factor of 3.6 at 50 \% signal acceptance, with jet mass decorrelated. This study indicates that supervised Standard Model jet classifiers have great potential in general new physics searches.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for the problem of global optimization in univariate loss functions. For the performance evaluation, we study the cumulative regret of the algorithm instead of the simple regret between our best query and the optimal value of the objective function. Although our approach has similar regret results with the traditional lower-bounding algorithms such as the Piyavskii-Shubert method for the Lipschitz continuous or Lipschitz smooth functions, it has a major computational cost advantage. In Piyavskii-Shubert method, for certain types of functions, the query points may be hard to determine (as they are solutions to additional optimization problems). However, this issue is circumvented in our binary sampling approach, where the sampling set is predetermined irrespective of the function characteristics. For a search space of $[0,1]$, our approach has at most $L\log (3T)$ and $2.25H$ regret for $L$-Lipschitz continuous and $H$-Lipschitz smooth functions respectively. We also analytically extend our results for a broader class of functions that covers more complex regularity conditions.

**Abstract:** A fundamental challenge in Bayesian inference is efficient representation of a target distribution. Many non-parametric approaches do so by sampling a large number of points using variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We propose an MCMC variant that retains only those posterior samples which exceed a KSD threshold, which we call KSD Thinning. We establish the convergence and complexity tradeoffs for several settings of KSD Thinning as a function of the KSD threshold parameter, sample size, and other problem parameters. Finally, we provide experimental comparisons against other online nonparametric Bayesian methods that generate low-complexity posterior representations, and observe superior consistency/complexity tradeoffs. Code is available at github.com/colehawkins/KSD-Thinning.

**Abstract:** Rapid growth of the biomedical literature has led to many advances in the biomedical text mining field. Among the vast amount of information, biomedical article abstracts are the easily accessible sources. However, the number of the structured abstracts, describing the rhetorical sections with one of Background, Objective, Method, Result and Conclusion categories is still not considerable. Exploration of valuable information in the biomedical abstracts can be expedited with the improvements in the sequential sentence classification task. Deep learning based models has great performance/potential in achieving significant results in this task. However, they can often be overly complex and overfit to specific data. In this project, we study a state-of-the-art deep learning model, which we called SSN-4 model here. We investigate different components of the SSN-4 model to study the trade-off between the performance and complexity. We explore how well this model generalizes to a new data set beyond Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) dataset. We address the question that whether word embeddings can be adjusted to the task to improve the performance. Furthermore, we develop a second model that addresses the confusion pairs in the first model. Results show that SSN-4 model does not appear to generalize well beyond RCT dataset.

**Abstract:** When faced with changing environment, highly configurable software systems need to dynamically search for promising adaptation plan that keeps the best possible performance, e.g., higher throughput or smaller latency -- a typical planning problem for self-adaptive systems (SASs). However, given the rugged and complex search landscape with multiple local optima, such a SAS planning is challenging especially in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose LiDOS, a lifelong dynamic optimization framework for SAS planning. What makes LiDOS unique is that to handle the "dynamic", we formulate the SAS planning as a multi-modal optimization problem, aiming to preserve the useful information for better dealing with the local optima issue under dynamic environment changes. This differs from existing planners in that the "dynamic" is not explicitly handled during the search process in planning. As such, the search and planning in LiDOS run continuously over the lifetime of SAS, terminating only when it is taken offline or the search space has been covered under an environment.
  Experimental results on three real-world SASs show that the concept of explicitly handling dynamic as part of the search in the SAS planning is effective, as LiDOS outperforms its stationary counterpart overall with up to 10x improvement. It also achieves better results in general over state-of-the-art planners and with 1.4x to 10x speedup on generating promising adaptation plans.

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks are designed to learn functions on graphs. Typically, the relevant target functions are invariant with respect to actions by permutations. Therefore the design of some graph neural network architectures has been inspired by graph-isomorphism algorithms. The classical Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm (WL) -- a graph-isomorphism test based on color refinement -- became relevant to the study of graph neural networks. The WL test can be generalized to a hierarchy of higher-order tests, known as $k$-WL. This hierarchy has been used to characterize the expressive power of graph neural networks, and to inspire the design of graph neural network architectures. A few variants of the WL hierarchy appear in the literature. The goal of this short note is pedagogical and practical: We explain the differences between the WL and folklore-WL formulations, with pointers to existing discussions in the literature. We illuminate the differences between the formulations by visualizing an example.

**Abstract:** Dynamic scheduling is an important problem in applications from queuing to wireless networks. It addresses how to choose an item among multiple scheduling items in each timestep to achieve a long-term goal. Conventional approaches for dynamic scheduling find the optimal policy for a given specific system so that the policy from these approaches is usable only for the corresponding system characteristics. Hence, it is hard to use such approaches for a practical system in which system characteristics dynamically change. This paper proposes a novel policy structure for MDP-based dynamic scheduling, a descriptive policy, which has a system-agnostic capability to adapt to unseen system characteristics for an identical task (dynamic scheduling). To this end, the descriptive policy learns a system-agnostic scheduling principle--in a nutshell, "which condition of items should have a higher priority in scheduling". The scheduling principle can be applied to any system so that the descriptive policy learned in one system can be used for another system. Experiments with simple explanatory and realistic application scenarios demonstrate that it enables system-agnostic meta-learning with very little performance degradation compared with the system-specific conventional policies.

**Abstract:** The analysis of causation is a challenging task that can be approached in various ways. With the increasing use of machine learning based models in computational socioeconomics, explaining these models while taking causal connections into account is a necessity. In this work, we advocate the use of an explanatory framework from cooperative game theory augmented with $do$ calculus, namely causal Shapley values. Using causal Shapley values, we analyze socioeconomic disparities that have a causal link to the spread of COVID-19 in the USA. We study several phases of the disease spread to show how the causal connections change over time. We perform a causal analysis using random effects models and discuss the correspondence between the two methods to verify our results. We show the distinct advantages a non-linear machine learning models have over linear models when performing a multivariate analysis, especially since the machine learning models can map out non-linear correlations in the data. In addition, the causal Shapley values allow for including the causal structure in the variable importance computed for the machine learning model.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining success and importance in many different tasks. The growing pervasiveness and complexity of AI systems push researchers towards developing dedicated hardware accelerators. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) represent a promising solution in this sense since they implement models that are more suitable for a reliable hardware design. Moreover, from a neuroscience perspective, they better emulate a human brain. This work presents the development of a hardware accelerator for an SNN, with off-line training, applied to an image recognition task, using the MNIST as the target dataset. Many techniques are used to minimize the area and to maximize the performance, such as the replacement of the multiplication operation with simple bit shifts and the minimization of the time spent on inactive spikes, useless for the update of neurons' internal state. The design targets a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, using in total around the 40% of the available hardware resources and reducing the classification time by three orders of magnitude, with a small 4.5% impact on the accuracy, if compared to its software, full precision counterpart.

**Abstract:** Capturing structural similarity has been a hot topic in the field of network embedding recently due to its great help in understanding the node functions and behaviors. However, existing works have paid very much attention to learning structures on homogeneous networks while the related study on heterogeneous networks is still a void. In this paper, we try to take the first step for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging due to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying structures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures, we firstly propose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous walk (HAW) and its variant coarse HAW (CHAW). Then, we devise the heterogeneous anonymous walk embedding (HAWE) and its variant coarse HAWE in a data-driven manner to circumvent using an extremely large number of possible walks and train embeddings by predicting occurring walks in the neighborhood of each node. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure learning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate our methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classic methods, and can be applied on large-scale networks.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a divide-and-conquer algorithm to improve sentence alignment speed. We utilize external bilingual sentence embeddings to find accurate hard delimiters for the parallel texts to be aligned. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show experimentally that using this divide-and-conquer algorithm, we can turn any quadratic time complexity sentence alignment algorithm into an algorithm with average time complexity of O(NlogN). On a standard OCR-generated dataset, our method improves the Bleualign baseline by 3 F1 points. Besides, when computational resources are restricted, our algorithm is faster than Vecalign in practice.

**Abstract:** Click-through rate(CTR) prediction is a core task in cost-per-click(CPC) advertising systems and has been studied extensively by machine learning practitioners. While many existing methods have been successfully deployed in practice, most of them are built upon i.i.d.(independent and identically distributed) assumption, ignoring that the click data used for training and inference is collected through time and is intrinsically non-stationary and drifting. This mismatch will inevitably lead to sub-optimal performance. To address this problem, we formulate CTR prediction as a continual learning task and propose COLF, a hybrid COntinual Learning Framework for CTR prediction, which has a memory-based modular architecture that is designed to adapt, learn and give predictions continuously when faced with non-stationary drifting click data streams. Married with a memory population method that explicitly controls the discrepancy between memory and target data, COLF is able to gain positive knowledge from its historical experience and makes improved CTR predictions. Empirical evaluations on click log collected from a major shopping app in China demonstrate our method's superiority over existing methods. Additionally, we have deployed our method online and observed significant CTR and revenue improvement, which further demonstrates our method's efficacy.

**Abstract:** The prevalence and perniciousness of fake news has been a critical issue on the Internet, which stimulates the development of automatic fake news detection in turn. In this paper, we focus on the evidence-based fake news detection, where several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a claim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the semantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on different attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer from two main weaknesses. Firstly, due to the inherent drawbacks of sequential models, they fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far apart in evidences for veracity checking. Secondly, they neglect much redundant information contained in evidences that may be useless or even harmful. To solve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic sTructure mining framework, namely GET in short. Specifically, different from the existing work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we model them as graph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among dispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by performing graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module for predictions. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of GET over the state-of-the-arts.

**Abstract:** Finding an optimal set of critical nodes in a complex network has been a long-standing problem in the fields of both artificial intelligence and operations research. Potential applications include epidemic control, network security, carbon emission monitoring, emergence response, drug design, and vulnerability assessment. In this work, we consider the problem of finding a minimal node separator whose removal separates a graph into multiple different connected components with fewer than a limited number of vertices in each component. To solve it, we propose a frequent itemset-driven search approach, which integrates the concept of frequent itemset mining in data mining into the well-known memetic search framework. Starting from a high-quality population built by the solution construction and population repair procedures, it iteratively employs the frequent itemset recombination operator (to generate promising offspring solution based on itemsets that frequently occur in high-quality solutions), tabu search-based simulated annealing (to find high-quality local optima), population repair procedure (to modify the population), and rank-based population management strategy (to guarantee a healthy population). Extensive evaluations on 50 widely used benchmark instances show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, it discovers 29 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous best-known bounds. Finally, experimental analyses are performed to confirm the effectiveness of key algorithmic modules of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** Business process (BP) analysis represents a first key phase of information system development. It consists in the gathering of domain knowledge and its organization to be later used in the software development, and beyond (e.g., for Business Process Reengineering). The quality of the developed information system largely depends on how the BP analysis has been carried out and the quality of the produced requirement specification documents. Despite the fact that the issue is on the table for decades, business process analysis is still a critical phase of information systems development. One promising strategy is an early and more important involvement of business experts in the BP analysis. This paper presents a methodology that aims at an early involvement of business experts while providing a formal grounding that guarantees the quality of the produced specifications. To this end, we propose the Business Process Analysis Canvas, a knowledge framework organized in eight knowledge sections aimed at supporting the business expert in carrying out the analysis, eventually yielding a BP analysis Ontology.

**Abstract:** A common misconception among blockchain users is that pseudonymity guarantees privacy. The reality is almost the opposite. Every transaction one makes is recorded on a public ledger and reveals information about one's identity. Mixers, such as Tornado Cash, were developed to preserve privacy through "mixing" transactions with those of others in an anonymity pool, making it harder to link deposits and withdrawals from the pool. Unfortunately, it is still possible to reveal information about those in the anonymity pool if users are not careful. We introduce Tutela, an application built on expert heuristics to report the true anonymity of an Ethereum address. In particular, Tutela has three functionalities: first, it clusters together Ethereum addresses based on interaction history such that for an Ethereum address, we can identify other addresses likely owned by the same entity; second, it shows Ethereum users their potentially compromised transactions; third, Tutela computes the true size of the anonymity pool of each Tornado Cash mixer by excluding potentially compromised transactions. A public implementation of Tutela can be found at https://github.com/TutelaLabs/tutela-app. To use Tutela, visit https://www.tutela.xyz.

**Abstract:** We develop a new numerical framework, employing physics-informed neural networks, to find a smooth self-similar solution for the Boussinesq equations. The solution in addition corresponds to an asymptotic self-similar profile for the 3-dimensional Euler equations in the presence of a cylindrical boundary. In particular, the solution represents a precise description of the Luo-Hou blow-up scenario [G. Luo, T. Hou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 111(36): 12968-12973, 2014] for 3-dimensional Euler. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the solution is the first truly multi-dimensional smooth backwards self-similar profile found for an equation from fluid mechanics. The new numerical framework is shown to be both robust and readily adaptable to other equations.

**Abstract:** Structural neural network pruning aims to remove the redundant channels in the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by pruning the filters of less importance to the final output accuracy. To reduce the degradation of performance after pruning, many methods utilize the loss with sparse regularization to produce structured sparsity. In this paper, we analyze these sparsity-training-based methods and find that the regularization of unpruned channels is unnecessary. Moreover, it restricts the network's capacity, which leads to under-fitting. To solve this problem, we propose a novel pruning method, named MaskSparsity, with pruning-aware sparse regularization. MaskSparsity imposes the fine-grained sparse regularization on the specific filters selected by a pruning mask, rather than all the filters of the model. Before the fine-grained sparse regularization of MaskSparity, we can use many methods to get the pruning mask, such as running the global sparse regularization. MaskSparsity achieves 63.03%-FLOPs reduction on ResNet-110 by removing 60.34% of the parameters, with no top-1 accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. On ILSVRC-2012, MaskSparsity reduces more than 51.07% FLOPs on ResNet-50, with only a loss of 0.76% in the top-1 accuracy.
  The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/MaskSparsity. Moreover, we have integrated the code of MaskSparity into a PyTorch pruning toolkit, EasyPruner, at https://gitee.com/casia_iva_engineer/easypruner.

**Abstract:** Text classification algorithms investigate the intricate relationships between words or phrases and attempt to deduce the document's interpretation. In the last few years, these algorithms have progressed tremendously. Transformer architecture and sentence encoders have proven to give superior results on natural language processing tasks. But a major limitation of these architectures is their applicability for text no longer than a few hundred words. In this paper, we explore hierarchical transfer learning approaches for long document classification. We employ pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in a hierarchical setup to capture better representations efficiently. Our proposed models are conceptually simple where we divide the input data into chunks and then pass this through base models of BERT and USE. Then output representation for each chunk is then propagated through a shallow neural network comprising of LSTMs or CNNs for classifying the text data. These extensions are evaluated on 6 benchmark datasets. We show that USE + CNN/LSTM performs better than its stand-alone baseline. Whereas the BERT + CNN/LSTM performs on par with its stand-alone counterpart. However, the hierarchical BERT models are still desirable as it avoids the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in BERT. Along with the hierarchical approaches, this work also provides a comparison of different deep learning algorithms like USE, BERT, HAN, Longformer, and BigBird for long document classification. The Longformer approach consistently performs well on most of the datasets.

**Abstract:** We propose a patch-based method for the simultaneous denoising and fusion of a sequence of RAW multi-exposed images. A spatio-temporal criterion is used to select similar patches along the sequence, and a weighted principal component analysis permits to both denoise and fuse the multi exposed data. The overall strategy permits to denoise and fuse the set of images without the need of recovering each denoised image in the multi-exposure set, leading to a very efficient procedure. Several experiments show that the proposed method permits to obtain state-of-the-art fusion results with real RAW data.

**Abstract:** Control Systems, particularly closed-loop control systems (CLCS), are frequently used in production machines, vehicles, and robots nowadays. CLCS are needed to actively align actual values of a process to a given reference or set values in real-time with a very high precession. Yet, artificial intelligence (AI) is not used to model, design, optimize, and tune CLCS. This paper will highlight potential AI-empowered and -based control system designs and designing procedures, gathering new opportunities and research direction in the field of control system engineering. Therefore, this paper illustrates which building blocks within the standard block diagram of CLCS can be replaced by AI, i.e., artificial neuronal networks (ANN). Having processes with real-time contains and functional safety in mind, it is discussed if AI-based controller blocks can cope with these demands. By concluding the paper, the pros and cons of AI-empowered as well as -based CLCS designs are discussed, and possible research directions for introducing AI in the domain of control system engineering are given.

**Abstract:** The ability of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems to efficiently capture high-dimensional (HD) data has led to an inverse problem, which consists of recovering the HD signal from the compressed and noisy measurement. While reconstruction algorithms grow fast to solve it with the recent advances of deep learning, the fundamental issue of accurate and stable recovery remains. To this end, we propose deep equilibrium models (DEQ) for video SCI, fusing data-driven regularization and stable convergence in a theoretically sound manner. Each equilibrium model implicitly learns a nonexpansive operator and analytically computes the fixed point, thus enabling unlimited iterative steps and infinite network depth with only a constant memory requirement in training and testing. Specifically, we demonstrate how DEQ can be applied to two existing models for video SCI reconstruction: recurrent neural networks (RNN) and Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms. On a variety of datasets and real data, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our proposed method. The code and models will be released to the public.
