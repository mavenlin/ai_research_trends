**Abstract:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated amazing ability to synthesize images of 3D scenes from novel views. However, they rely upon specialized volumetric rendering algorithms based on ray marching that are mismatched to the capabilities of widely deployed graphics hardware. This paper introduces a new NeRF representation based on textured polygons that can synthesize novel images efficiently with standard rendering pipelines. The NeRF is represented as a set of polygons with textures representing binary opacities and feature vectors. Traditional rendering of the polygons with a z-buffer yields an image with features at every pixel, which are interpreted by a small, view-dependent MLP running in a fragment shader to produce a final pixel color. This approach enables NeRFs to be rendered with the traditional polygon rasterization pipeline, which provides massive pixel-level parallelism, achieving interactive frame rates on a wide range of compute platforms, including mobile phones.

**Abstract:** In this article, we propose a deep learning framework that provides a unified approach to the problem of leg contact detection in humanoid robot walking gaits. Our formulation accomplishes to accurately and robustly estimate the contact state probability for each leg (i.e., stable or slip/no contact). The proposed framework employs solely proprioceptive sensing and although it relies on simulated ground-truth contact data for the classification process, we demonstrate that it generalizes across varying friction surfaces and different legged robotic platforms and, at the same time, is readily transferred from simulation to practice. The framework is quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in simulation via the use of ground-truth contact data and is contrasted against state of-the-art methods with an ATLAS, a NAO, and a TALOS humanoid robot. Furthermore, its efficacy is demonstrated in base estimation with a real TALOS humanoid. To reinforce further research endeavors, our implementation is offered as an open-source ROS/Python package, coined Legged Contact Detection (LCD).

**Abstract:** Few-shot object detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating meta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. Despite its success, the said paradigm is still constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality region proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class correlation among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization of base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. In this work, we design Meta-DETR, which (i) is the first image-level few-shot detector, and (ii) introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to capture and leverage the correlation among different classes for robust and accurate few-shot object detection. Meta-DETR works entirely at image level without any region proposals, which circumvents the constraint of inaccurate proposals in prevalent few-shot detection frameworks. In addition, the introduced correlational meta-learning enables Meta-DETR to simultaneously attend to multiple support classes within a single feedforward, which allows to capture the inter-class correlation among different classes, thus significantly reducing the misclassification over similar classes and enhancing knowledge generalization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot object detection benchmarks show that the proposed Meta-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The implementation codes are available at https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/Meta-DETR.

**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) has been studied extensively and has grown to become a research field with substantial impact. While classical single-objective NAS searches for the architecture with the best performance, multi-objective NAS considers multiple objectives that should be optimized simultaneously, e.g., minimizing resource usage along the validation error. Although considerable progress has been made in the field of multi-objective NAS, we argue that there is some discrepancy between the actual optimization problem of practical interest and the optimization problem that multi-objective NAS tries to solve. We resolve this discrepancy by formulating the multi-objective NAS problem as a quality diversity optimization (QDO) problem and introduce three quality diversity NAS optimizers (two of them belonging to the group of multifidelity optimizers), which search for high-performing yet diverse architectures that are optimal for application-specific niches, e.g., hardware constraints. By comparing these optimizers to their multi-objective counterparts, we demonstrate that quality diversity NAS in general outperforms multi-objective NAS with respect to quality of solutions and efficiency. We further show how applications and future NAS research can thrive on QDO.

**Abstract:** In the reinforcement learning literature, there are many algorithms developed for either Contextual Bandit (CB) or Markov Decision Processes (MDP) environments. However, when deploying reinforcement learning algorithms in the real world, even with domain expertise, it is often difficult to know whether it is appropriate to treat a sequential decision making problem as a CB or an MDP. In other words, do actions affect future states, or only the immediate rewards? Making the wrong assumption regarding the nature of the environment can lead to inefficient learning, or even prevent the algorithm from ever learning an optimal policy, even with infinite data. In this work we develop an online algorithm that uses a Bayesian hypothesis testing approach to learn the nature of the environment. Our algorithm allows practitioners to incorporate prior knowledge about whether the environment is that of a CB or an MDP, and effectively interpolate between classical CB and MDP-based algorithms to mitigate against the effects of misspecifying the environment. We perform simulations and demonstrate that in CB settings our algorithm achieves lower regret than MDP-based algorithms, while in non-bandit MDP settings our algorithm is able to learn the optimal policy, often achieving comparable regret to MDP-based algorithms.

**Abstract:** We introduce a Dimension-Reduced Second-Order Method (DRSOM) for convex and nonconvex unconstrained optimization. Under a trust-region-like framework our method preserves the convergence of the second-order method while using only Hessian-vector products in two directions. Moreover, the computational overhead remains comparable to the first-order such as the gradient descent method. We show that the method has a complexity of $O(Îµ^{-3/2})$ to satisfy the first-order and second-order conditions in the subspace. The applicability and performance of DRSOM are exhibited by various computational experiments in logistic regression, $L_2-L_p$ minimization, sensor network localization, and neural network training. For neural networks, our preliminary implementation seems to gain computational advantages in terms of training accuracy and iteration complexity over state-of-the-art first-order methods including SGD and ADAM.

**Abstract:** In this study, a method has been developed to improve the resolution of histological human placenta images. For this purpose, a paired series of high- and low-resolution images have been collected to train a deep neural network model that can predict image residuals required to improve the resolution of the input images. A modified version of the U-net neural network model has been tailored to find the relationship between the low resolution and residual images. After training for 900 epochs on an augmented dataset of 1000 images, the relative mean squared error of 0.003 is achieved for the prediction of 320 test images. The proposed method has not only improved the contrast of the low-resolution images at the edges of cells but added critical details and textures that mimic high-resolution images of placenta villous space.

**Abstract:** Glass transitions are widely observed in a range of types of soft matter systems. However, the physical mechanism of these transitions remains unknown, despite years of ambitious research. In particular, an important unanswered question is whether the glass transition is accompanied by a divergence of the correlation lengths of the characteristic static structures. Recently, a method that can predict long-time dynamics from purely static information with high accuracy was proposed; however, even this method is not universal and does not work well for the Kob--Andersen system, which is a typical model of glass-forming liquids. In this study, we developed a method to extract the characteristic structures of glasses using machine learning or, specifically, a convolutional neural network. In particular, we extracted the characteristic structures by quantifying the grounds for the decisions made by the network. We considered two qualitatively different glass-forming binary systems and, through comparisons with several established structural indicators, we demonstrate that our system can identify characteristic structures that depend on the details of the systems. Surprisingly, the extracted structures were strongly correlated with the nonequilibrium aging dynamics on thermal fluctuation.

**Abstract:** We focus on better understanding the critical factors of augmentation-invariant representation learning. We revisit MoCo v2 and BYOL and try to prove the authenticity of the following assumption: different frameworks bring about representations of different characteristics even with the same pretext task. We establish the first benchmark for fair comparisons between MoCo v2 and BYOL, and observe: (i) sophisticated model configurations enable better adaptation to pre-training dataset; (ii) mismatched optimization strategies of pre-training and fine-tuning hinder model from achieving competitive transfer performances. Given the fair benchmark, we make further investigation and find asymmetry of network structure endows contrastive frameworks to work well under the linear evaluation protocol, while may hurt the transfer performances on long-tailed classification tasks. Moreover, negative samples do not make models more sensible to the choice of data augmentations, nor does the asymmetric network structure. We believe our findings provide useful information for future work.

**Abstract:** Diversity maximization is a fundamental problem with wide applications in data summarization, web search, and recommender systems. Given a set $X$ of $n$ elements, it asks to select a subset $S$ of $k \ll n$ elements with maximum \emph{diversity}, as quantified by the dissimilarities among the elements in $S$. In this paper, we focus on the diversity maximization problem with fairness constraints in the streaming setting. Specifically, we consider the max-min diversity objective, which selects a subset $S$ that maximizes the minimum distance (dissimilarity) between any pair of distinct elements within it. Assuming that the set $X$ is partitioned into $m$ disjoint groups by some sensitive attribute, e.g., sex or race, ensuring \emph{fairness} requires that the selected subset $S$ contains $k_i$ elements from each group $i \in [1,m]$. A streaming algorithm should process $X$ sequentially in one pass and return a subset with maximum \emph{diversity} while guaranteeing the fairness constraint. Although diversity maximization has been extensively studied, the only known algorithms that can work with the max-min diversity objective and fairness constraints are very inefficient for data streams. Since diversity maximization is NP-hard in general, we propose two approximation algorithms for fair diversity maximization in data streams, the first of which is $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{4}$-approximate and specific for $m=2$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, and the second of which achieves a $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{3m+2}$-approximation for an arbitrary $m$. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that both algorithms provide solutions of comparable quality to the state-of-the-art algorithms while running several orders of magnitude faster in the streaming setting.

**Abstract:** To reduce human annotations for relation extraction (RE) tasks, distantly supervised approaches have been proposed, while struggling with low performance. In this work, we propose a novel DSRE-NLI framework, which considers both distant supervision from existing knowledge bases and indirect supervision from pretrained language models for other tasks. DSRE-NLI energizes an off-the-shelf natural language inference (NLI) engine with a semi-automatic relation verbalization (SARV) mechanism to provide indirect supervision and further consolidates the distant annotations to benefit multi-classification RE models. The NLI-based indirect supervision acquires only one relation verbalization template from humans as a semantically general template for each relationship, and then the template set is enriched by high-quality textual patterns automatically mined from the distantly annotated corpus. With two simple and effective data consolidation strategies, the quality of training data is substantially improved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the SOTA performance (up to 7.73\% of F1) on distantly supervised RE benchmark datasets.

**Abstract:** Temperature monitoring is critical for electrical motors to determine if device protection measures should be executed. However, the complexity of the internal structure of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) makes the direct temperature measurement of the internal components difficult. This work pragmatically develops three deep learning models to estimate the PMSMs' internal temperature based on readily measurable external quantities. The proposed supervised learning models exploit Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modules, bidirectional LSTM, and attention mechanism to form encoder-decoder structures to predict simultaneously the temperatures of the stator winding, tooth, yoke, and permanent magnet. Experiments were conducted in an exhaustive manner on a benchmark dataset to verify the proposed models' performances. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed global attention-based encoder-decoder (EnDec) model provides a competitive overall performance of 1.72 Mean Squared Error (MSE) and 5.34 Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

**Abstract:** LiDAR point clouds, which are usually scanned by rotating LiDAR sensors continuously, capture precise geometry of the surrounding environment and are crucial to many autonomous detection and navigation tasks. Though many 3D deep architectures have been developed, efficient collection and annotation of large amounts of point clouds remain one major challenge in the analytic and understanding of point cloud data. This paper presents PolarMix, a point cloud augmentation technique that is simple and generic but can mitigate the data constraint effectively across different perception tasks and scenarios. PolarMix enriches point cloud distributions and preserves point cloud fidelity via two cross-scan augmentation strategies that cut, edit, and mix point clouds along the scanning direction. The first is scene-level swapping which exchanges point cloud sectors of two LiDAR scans that are cut along the azimuth axis. The second is instance-level rotation and paste which crops point instances from one LiDAR scan, rotates them by multiple angles (to create multiple copies), and paste the rotated point instances into other scans. Extensive experiments show that PolarMix achieves superior performance consistently across different perception tasks and scenarios. In addition, it can work as plug-and-play for various 3D deep architectures and also performs well for unsupervised domain adaptation.

**Abstract:** Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners, as the title of MAE \cite{he2022masked}, which suggests that self-supervised learning (SSL) in vision might undertake a similar trajectory as in NLP. Specifically, generative pretext tasks with the masked prediction (e.g., BERT) have become a de facto standard SSL practice in NLP. By contrast, early attempts at generative methods in vision have been buried by their discriminative counterparts (like contrastive learning); however, the success of mask image modeling has revived the masking autoencoder (often termed denoising autoencoder in the past). As a milestone to bridge the gap with BERT in NLP, masked autoencoder has attracted unprecedented attention for SSL in vision and beyond. This work conducts a comprehensive survey of masked autoencoders to shed insight on a promising direction of SSL. As the first to review SSL with masked autoencoders, this work focuses on its application in vision by discussing its historical developments, recent progress, and implications for diverse applications.

**Abstract:** In view of the poor robustness of existing Chinese grammatical error correction models on attack test sets and large model parameters, this paper uses the method of knowledge distillation to compress model parameters and improve the anti-attack ability of the model. In terms of data, the attack test set is constructed by integrating the disturbance into the standard evaluation data set, and the model robustness is evaluated by the attack test set. The experimental results show that the distilled small model can ensure the performance and improve the training speed under the condition of reducing the number of model parameters, and achieve the optimal effect on the attack test set, and the robustness is significantly improved.

**Abstract:** Robust quantization improves the tolerance of networks for various implementations, allowing reliable output in different bit-widths or fragmented low-precision arithmetic. In this work, we perform extensive analyses to identify the sources of quantization error and present three insights to robustify a network against quantization: reduction of error propagation, range clamping for error minimization, and inherited robustness against quantization. Based on these insights, we propose two novel methods called symmetry regularization (SymReg) and saturating nonlinearity (SatNL). Applying the proposed methods during training can enhance the robustness of arbitrary neural networks against quantization on existing post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) algorithms and enables us to obtain a single weight flexible enough to maintain the output quality under various conditions. We conduct extensive studies on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

**Abstract:** The performances of commonly used electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis models have recently improved with the introduction of deep learning (DL). However, the impact of various combinations of multiple DL components and/or the role of data augmentation techniques on the diagnosis have not been sufficiently investigated. This study proposes an ensemble-based multi-view learning approach with an ECG augmentation technique to achieve a higher performance than traditional automatic 12-lead ECG diagnosis methods. The data analysis results show that the proposed model reports an F1 score of 0.840, which outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods in the literature.

**Abstract:** As deep learning models and datasets rapidly scale up, network training is extremely time-consuming and resource-costly. Instead of training on the entire dataset, learning with a small synthetic dataset becomes an efficient solution. Extensive research has been explored in the direction of dataset condensation, among which gradient matching achieves state-of-the-art performance. The gradient matching method directly targets the training dynamics by matching the gradient when training on the original and synthetic datasets. However, there are limited deep investigations into the principle and effectiveness of this method. In this work, we delve into the gradient matching method from a comprehensive perspective and answer the critical questions of what, how, and where to match. We propose to match the multi-level gradients to involve both intra-class and inter-class gradient information. We demonstrate that the distance function should focus on the angle, considering the magnitude simultaneously to delay the overfitting. An overfitting-aware adaptive learning step strategy is also proposed to trim unnecessary optimization steps for algorithmic efficiency improvement. Ablation and comparison experiments demonstrate that our proposed methodology shows superior accuracy, efficiency, and generalization compared to prior work.

**Abstract:** Recently, the applications of the methodologies of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to NP-Hard Combinatorial optimization problems have become a popular topic. This is essentially due to the nature of the traditional combinatorial algorithms, often based on a trial-and-error process. RL aims at automating this process. At this regard, this paper focuses on the application of RL for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a famous combinatorial problem that belongs to the class of NP-Hard problems. In this work, first, the problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then the PPO method (which belongs to the Actor-Critic class of Reinforcement learning methods) is applied. In a second phase, the neural architecture behind the Actor and Critic has been established, choosing to adopt a neural architecture based on the Convolutional neural networks, both for the Actor and the Critic. This choice resulted in effectively addressing problems of different sizes. Experiments performed on a wide range of instances show that the algorithm has good generalization capabilities and can reach good solutions in a short time. Comparisons between the algorithm proposed and the state-of-the-art solver OR-TOOLS show that the latter still outperforms the Reinforcement learning algorithm. However, there are future research perspectives, that aim to upgrade the current performance of the algorithm proposed.

**Abstract:** In our multicultural world, affect-aware AI systems that support humans need the ability to perceive affect across variations in emotion expression patterns across cultures. These models must perform well in cultural contexts on which they have not been trained. A standard assumption in affective computing is that affect recognition models trained and used within the same culture (intracultural) will perform better than models trained on one culture and used on different cultures (intercultural). We test this assumption and present the first systematic study of intercultural affect recognition models using videos of real-world dyadic interactions from six cultures. We develop an attention-based feature selection approach under temporal causal discovery to identify behavioral cues that can be leveraged in intercultural affect recognition models. Across all six cultures, our findings demonstrate that intercultural affect recognition models were as effective or more effective than intracultural models. We identify and contribute useful behavioral features for intercultural affect recognition; facial features from the visual modality were more useful than the audio modality in this study's context. Our paper presents a proof-of-concept and motivation for the future development of intercultural affect recognition systems.

**Abstract:** Research on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has focused on improving performance and accuracy for real-world deployments, leading to new models, such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), and optimization techniques, e.g., quantization and pruning for compressed networks. However, the deployment of these innovative models and optimization techniques introduces possible reliability issues, which is a pillar for DNNs to be widely used in safety-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving. Moreover, scaling technology nodes have the associated risk of multiple faults happening at the same time, a possibility not addressed in state-of-the-art resiliency analyses.
  Towards better reliability analysis for DNNs, we present enpheeph, a Fault Injection Framework for Spiking and Compressed DNNs. The enpheeph framework enables optimized execution on specialized hardware devices, e.g., GPUs, while providing complete customizability to investigate different fault models, emulating various reliability constraints and use-cases. Hence, the faults can be executed on SNNs as well as compressed networks with minimal-to-none modifications to the underlying code, a feat that is not achievable by other state-of-the-art tools.
  To evaluate our enpheeph framework, we analyze the resiliency of different DNN and SNN models, with different compression techniques. By injecting a random and increasing number of faults, we show that DNNs can show a reduction in accuracy with a fault rate as low as 7 x 10 ^ (-7) faults per parameter, with an accuracy drop higher than 40%. Run-time overhead when executing enpheeph is less than 20% of the baseline execution time when executing 100 000 faults concurrently, at least 10x lower than state-of-the-art frameworks, making enpheeph future-proof for complex fault injection scenarios.
  We release enpheeph at https://github.com/Alexei95/enpheeph.

**Abstract:** In the practical applications of computed tomography imaging, the projection data may be acquired within a limited-angle range and corrupted by noises due to the limitation of scanning conditions. The noisy incomplete projection data results in the ill-posedness of the inverse problems. In this work, we theoretically verify that the low-resolution reconstruction problem has better numerical stability than the high-resolution problem. In what follows, a novel low-resolution image prior based CT reconstruction model is proposed to make use of the low-resolution image to improve the reconstruction quality. More specifically, we build up a low-resolution reconstruction problem on the down-sampled projection data, and use the reconstructed low-resolution image as prior knowledge for the original limited-angle CT problem. We solve the constrained minimization problem by the alternating direction method with all subproblems approximated by the convolutional neural networks. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our double-resolution network outperforms both the variational method and popular learning-based reconstruction methods on noisy limited-angle reconstruction problems.

**Abstract:** This work describes PUSH, a primal heuristic combining Feasibility Pump and Shifting. The main idea is to replace the rounding phase of the Feasibility Pump with a suitable adaptation of the Shifting and other rounding heuristics. The algorithm presents different strategies, depending on the nature of the partial rounding obtained. In particular, we distinguish when the partial solution is feasible, infeasible with potential candidates, and infeasible without candidates. We used a threshold to indicate the percentage of variables to round with our algorithm and which other to round to the nearest integer. Most importantly, our algorithm tackles directly equality constraints without duplicating rows. We select the parameters of our algorithm on the 19 instances provided for the Mip Competition 2022. Finally, we compared our approach to other start heuristics, like Simple Rounding, Rounding, Shifting, and Feasibility Pump on the first 800 MIPLIB2017 instances ordered by the number of non-zeros.

**Abstract:** The rapidly enlarging neural network models are becoming increasingly challenging to run on a single device. Hence model parallelism over multiple devices is critical to guarantee the efficiency of training large models. Recent proposals fall short either in long processing time or poor performance. Therefore, we propose Celeritas, a fast framework for optimizing device placement for large models. Celeritas employs a simple but efficient model parallelization strategy in the Standard Evaluation, and generates placement policies through a series of scheduling algorithms. We conduct experiments to deploy and evaluate Celeritas on numerous large models. The results show that Celeritas not only reduces the placement policy generation time by 26.4\% but also improves the model running time by 34.2\% compared to most advanced methods.

**Abstract:** In this study, we have tailored a pixel tracking method for temporal extrapolation of the ventricular segmentation masks in cardiac magnetic resonance images. The pixel tracking process starts from the end-diastolic frame of the heart cycle using the available manually segmented images to predict the end-systolic segmentation mask. The superpixels approach is used to divide the raw images into smaller cells and in each time frame, new labels are assigned to the image cells which leads to tracking the movement of the heart wall elements through different frames. The tracked masks at the end of systole are compared with the already available manually segmented masks and dice scores are found to be between 0.81 to 0.84. Considering the fact that the proposed method does not necessarily require a training dataset, it could be an attractive alternative approach to deep learning segmentation methods in scenarios where training data are limited.

**Abstract:** We propose a local-to-global strategy for graph machine learning and network analysis by defining certain local features and vector representations of nodes and then using them to learn globally defined metrics and properties of the nodes by means of deep neural networks. By extending the notion of the degree of a node via Breath-First Search, a general family of {\bf parametric centrality functions} is defined which are able to reveal the importance of nodes. We introduce the {\bf neighbors degree frequency (NDF)}, as a locally defined embedding of nodes of undirected graphs into euclidean spaces. This gives rise to a vectorized labeling of nodes which encodes the structure of local neighborhoods of nodes and can be used for graph isomorphism testing. We add flexibility to our construction so that it can handle dynamic graphs as well. Afterwards, the Breadth-First Search is used to extend NDF vector representations into two different matrix representations of nodes which contain higher order information about the neighborhoods of nodes. Our matrix representations of nodes provide us with a new way of visualizing the shape of the neighborhood of a node. Furthermore, we use these matrix representations to obtain feature vectors, which are suitable for typical deep learning algorithms. To demonstrate these node embeddings actually contain some information about the nodes, in a series of examples, we show that PageRank and closeness centrality can be learned by applying deep learning to these local features. Our constructions are flexible enough to handle evolving graphs. Finally, we explain how to adapt our constructions for directed graphs.

**Abstract:** In the domain of face recognition, there exists a puzzling timing discrepancy between results from macaque neurophysiology on the one hand and human electrophysiology on the other. Single unit recordings in macaques have demonstrated face identity specific responses in extra-striate visual cortex within 100 milliseconds of stimulus onset. In EEG and MEG experiments with humans, however, a consistent distinction between neural activity corresponding to unfamiliar and familiar faces has been reported to emerge around 250 ms. This points to the possibility that there may be a hitherto undiscovered early correlate of face familiarity perception in human electrophysiological traces. We report here a successful search for such a correlate in dense MEG recordings using pattern classification techniques. Our analyses reveal markers of face familiarity as early as 85 ms after stimulus onset. Low-level attributes of the images, such as luminance and color distributions, are unable to account for this early emerging response difference. These results help reconcile human and macaque data, and provide clues regarding neural mechanisms underlying familiar face perception.

**Abstract:** In today's era of smart cyber-physical systems, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous due to their state-of-the-art performance in complex real-world applications. The high computational complexity of these networks, which translates to increased energy consumption, is the foremost obstacle towards deploying large DNNs in resource-constrained systems. Fixed-Point (FP) implementations achieved through post-training quantization are commonly used to curtail the energy consumption of these networks. However, the uniform quantization intervals in FP restrict the bit-width of data structures to large values due to the need to represent most of the numbers with sufficient resolution and avoid high quantization errors. In this paper, we leverage the key insight that (in most of the scenarios) DNN weights and activations are mostly concentrated near zero and only a few of them have large magnitudes. We propose CoNLoCNN, a framework to enable energy-efficient low-precision deep convolutional neural network inference by exploiting: (1) non-uniform quantization of weights enabling simplification of complex multiplication operations; and (2) correlation between activation values enabling partial compensation of quantization errors at low cost without any run-time overheads. To significantly benefit from non-uniform quantization, we also propose a novel data representation format, Encoded Low-Precision Binary Signed Digit, to compress the bit-width of weights while ensuring direct use of the encoded weight for processing using a novel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit design.

**Abstract:** Recent efforts for improving the performance of neural network (NN) accelerators that meet today's application requirements have given rise to a new trend of logic-based NN inference relying on fixed function combinational logic. Mapping such large Boolean functions with many input variables and product terms to digital signal processors (DSPs) on Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) needs a novel framework considering the structure and the reconfigurability of DSP blocks during this process. The proposed methodology in this paper maps the fixed function combinational logic blocks to a set of Boolean functions where Boolean operations corresponding to each function are mapped to DSP devices rather than look-up tables (LUTs) on the FPGAs to take advantage of the high performance, low latency, and parallelism of DSP blocks. %
This paper also presents an innovative design and optimization methodology for compilation and mapping of NNs, utilizing fixed function combinational logic to DSPs on FPGAs employing high-level synthesis flow. %
Our experimental evaluations across several \REVone{datasets} and selected NNs demonstrate the comparable performance of our framework in terms of the inference latency and output accuracy compared to prior art FPGA-based NN accelerators employing DSPs.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a stochastic gradient algorithm for minimizing a smooth objective function that is an expectation over noisy cost samples and only the latter are observed for any given parameter. Our algorithm employs a gradient estimation scheme with random perturbations, which are formed using the truncated Cauchy distribution from the unit sphere. We analyze the bias and variance of the proposed gradient estimator. Our algorithm is found to be particularly useful in the case when the objective function is non-convex, and the parameter dimension is high. From an asymptotic convergence analysis, we establish that our algorithm converges almost surely to the set of stationary points of the objective function and obtain the asymptotic convergence rate. We also show that our algorithm avoids unstable equilibria, implying convergence to local minima. Further, we perform a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we establish here a non-asymptotic bound for finding an $Îµ$-stationary point of the non-convex objective function. Finally, we demonstrate numerically through simulations that the performance of our algorithm outperforms GSF, SPSA and RDSA by a significant margin over a few non-convex settings and further validate its performance over convex (noisy) objectives.

**Abstract:** GitHub is the largest host of open source software on the Internet. This large, freely accessible database has attracted the attention of practitioners and researchers alike. But as GitHub's growth continues, it is becoming increasingly hard to navigate the plethora of repositories which span a wide range of domains. Past work has shown that taking the application domain into account is crucial for tasks such as predicting the popularity of a repository and reasoning about project quality. In this work, we build on a previously annotated dataset of 5,000 GitHub repositories to design an automated classifier for categorising repositories by their application domain. The classifier uses state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques and machine learning to learn from multiple data sources and catalogue repositories according to five application domains. We contribute with (1) an automated classifier that can assign popular repositories to each application domain with at least 70% precision, (2) an investigation of the approach's performance on less popular repositories, and (3) a practical application of this approach to answer how the adoption of software engineering practices differs across application domains. Our work aims to help the GitHub community identify repositories of interest and opens promising avenues for future work investigating differences between repositories from different application domains.

**Abstract:** Deep learning models have been successfully applied to a variety of software engineering tasks, such as code classification, summarisation, and bug and vulnerability detection. In order to apply deep learning to these tasks, source code needs to be represented in a format that is suitable for input into the deep learning model. Most approaches to representing source code, such as tokens, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), data flow graphs (DFGs), and control flow graphs (CFGs) only focus on the code itself and do not take into account additional context that could be useful for deep learning models. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial for deep learning models to have access to additional contextual information about the code being analysed. We present preliminary evidence that encoding context from the call hierarchy along with information from the code itself can improve the performance of a state-of-the-art deep learning model for two software engineering tasks. We outline our research agenda for adding further contextual information to source code representations for deep learning.

**Abstract:** There are many challenges associated with analysing gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that electron ionisation can make it difficult to recover molecular information due to the high degree of fragmentation with concomitant loss of molecular ion signal. With GC-MS data there are often many common fragment ions shared among closely-eluting peaks, necessitating sophisticated methods for analysis. Some of these methods are fully automated, but make some assumptions about the data which can introduce artifacts during the analysis. Chemometric methods such as Multivariate Curve Resolution, or Parallel Factor Analysis are particularly attractive, since they are flexible and make relatively few assumptions about the data - ideally resulting in fewer artifacts. These methods do require expert user intervention to determine the most relevant regions of interest and an appropriate number of components, $k$, for each region. Automated region of interest selection is needed to permit automated batch processing of chromatographic data with advanced signal deconvolution. Here, we propose a new method for automated, untargeted region of interest selection that accounts for the multivariate information present in GC-MS data to select regions of interest based on the ratio of the squared first, and second singular values from the Singular Value Decomposition of a window that moves across the chromatogram. Assuming that the first singular value accounts largely for signal, and that the second singular value accounts largely for noise, it is possible to interpret the relationship between these two values as a probabilistic distribution of Fisher Ratios. The sensitivity of the algorithm was tested by investigating the concentration at which the algorithm can no longer pick out chromatographic regions known to contain signal.

**Abstract:** We explore clustering the softmax predictions of deep neural networks and introduce a novel probabilistic clustering method, referred to as k-sBetas. In the general context of clustering distributions, the existing methods focused on exploring distortion measures tailored to simplex data, such as the KL divergence, as alternatives to the standard Euclidean distance. We provide a general perspective of clustering distributions, which emphasizes that the statistical models underlying distortion-based methods may not be descriptive enough. Instead, we optimize a mixed-variable objective measuring the conformity of data within each cluster to the introduced sBeta density function, whose parameters are constrained and estimated jointly with binary assignment variables. Our versatile formulation approximates a variety of parametric densities for modeling cluster data, and enables to control the cluster-balance bias. This yields highly competitive performances for efficient unsupervised adjustment of black-box predictions in a variety of scenarios, including one-shot classification and unsupervised domain adaptation in real-time for road segmentation. Implementation is available at https://github.com/fchiaroni/Clustering_Softmax_Predictions.
