**Abstract:** Training machine learning algorithms is a computationally intensive process, which is frequently memory-bound due to repeatedly accessing large training datasets. As a result, processor-centric systems (e.g., CPU, GPU) suffer from costly data movement between memory units and processing units, which consumes large amounts of energy and execution cycles. Memory-centric computing systems, i.e., computing systems with processing-in-memory (PIM) capabilities, can alleviate this data movement bottleneck.
  Our goal is to understand the potential of modern general-purpose PIM architectures to accelerate machine learning training. To do so, we (1) implement several representative classic machine learning algorithms (namely, linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, K-means clustering) on a real-world general-purpose PIM architecture, (2) characterize them in terms of accuracy, performance and scaling, and (3) compare to their counterpart implementations on CPU and GPU. Our experimental evaluation on a memory-centric computing system with more than 2500 PIM cores shows that general-purpose PIM architectures can greatly accelerate memory-bound machine learning workloads, when the necessary operations and datatypes are natively supported by PIM hardware.
  To our knowledge, our work is the first one to evaluate training of machine learning algorithms on a real-world general-purpose PIM architecture.

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on downstream tasks has been adopted in a variety of domains recently. However, it is costly to update the entire parameter set of large pre-trained models. Although recently proposed parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) techniques allow updating a small subset of parameters (e.g. only using 2% of parameters) inside a pre-trained backbone network for a new task, they only reduce the training memory requirement by up to 30%. This is because the gradient computation for the trainable parameters still requires backpropagation through the large pre-trained backbone model. To address this, we propose Ladder Side-Tuning (LST), a new PETL technique that reduces training memory requirements by more substantial amounts. Unlike existing parameter-efficient methods that insert additional parameters inside backbone networks, we train a ladder side network, a small and separate network that takes intermediate activations as input via shortcut connections (ladders) from backbone networks and makes predictions. LST has significantly lower memory requirements than previous methods, because it does not require backpropagation through the backbone network, but instead only through the side network and ladder connections. We evaluate our method with various models (T5, CLIP-T5) on both NLP (GLUE) and vision-language (VQA, GQA, NLVR2, MSCOCO) tasks. LST saves 69% of the memory costs to fine-tune the whole network, while other methods only save 26% of that in similar parameter usages (hence, 2.7x more memory savings). Moreover, LST achieves higher accuracy than Adapter and LoRA in a low-memory regime. To further show the advantage of this better memory efficiency, we also apply LST to larger T5 models (T5-large, T5-3B), attaining better GLUE performance than full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. The exact same trend also holds in our experiments on VL tasks.

**Abstract:** Automatic summarization methods are efficient but can suffer from low quality. In comparison, manual summarization is expensive but produces higher quality. Can humans and AI collaborate to improve summarization performance? In similar text generation tasks (e.g., machine translation), human-AI collaboration in the form of "post-editing" AI-generated text reduces human workload and improves the quality of AI output. Therefore, we explored whether post-editing offers advantages in text summarization. Specifically, we conducted an experiment with 72 participants, comparing post-editing provided summaries with manual summarization for summary quality, human efficiency, and user experience on formal (XSum news) and informal (Reddit posts) text. This study sheds valuable insights on when post-editing is useful for text summarization: it helped in some cases (e.g., when participants lacked domain knowledge) but not in others (e.g., when provided summaries include inaccurate information). Participants' different editing strategies and needs for assistance offer implications for future human-AI summarization systems.

**Abstract:** Particle-based modeling of materials at atomic scale plays an important role in the development of new materials and understanding of their properties. The accuracy of particle simulations is determined by interatomic potentials, which allow to calculate the potential energy of an atomic system as a function of atomic coordinates and potentially other properties. First-principles-based ab initio potentials can reach arbitrary levels of accuracy, however their aplicability is limited by their high computational cost.
  Machine learning (ML) has recently emerged as an effective way to offset the high computational costs of ab initio atomic potentials by replacing expensive models with highly efficient surrogates trained on electronic structure data. Among a plethora of current methods, symbolic regression (SR) is gaining traction as a powerful "white-box" approach for discovering functional forms of interatomic potentials.
  This contribution discusses the role of symbolic regression in Materials Science (MS) and offers a comprehensive overview of current methodological challenges and state-of-the-art results. A genetic programming-based approach for modeling atomic potentials from raw data (consisting of snapshots of atomic positions and associated potential energy) is presented and empirically validated on ab initio electronic structure data.

**Abstract:** Learning a common representation space between vision and language allows deep networks to relate objects in the image to the corresponding semantic meaning. We present a model that learns a shared Gaussian mixture representation imposing the compositionality of the text onto the visual domain without having explicit location supervision. By combining the spatial transformer with a representation learning approach we learn to split images into separately encoded patches to associate visual and textual representations in an interpretable manner. On variations of MNIST and CIFAR10, our model is able to perform weakly supervised object detection and demonstrates its ability to extrapolate to unseen combination of objects.

**Abstract:** Algorithms play a key role nowadays in many technological systems that control or affect various aspects of our lives. As a result, providing explanations to address the needs of users and organisations is increasingly expected by the laws and regulations, codes of conduct, and the public. However, as laws and regulations do not prescribe how to meet such expectations, organisations are often left to devise their own approaches to explainability, inevitably increasing the cost of compliance and good governance. Hence, we put forth "Explainability by Design", a holistic methodology characterised by proactive measures to include explanation capability in the design of decision-making systems. This paper describes the technical steps of the Explainability-by-Design methodology in a software engineering workflow to implement explanation capability from requirements elicited by domain experts for a specific application context. Outputs of the Explainability-by-Design methodology are a set of configurations, allowing a reusable service, called the Explanation Assistant, to exploit logs provided by applications and create provenance traces that can be queried to extract relevant data points, which in turn can be used in explanation plans to construct explanations personalised to their consumers. Following those steps, organisations will be able to design their decision-making systems to produce explanations that meet the specified requirements, be it from laws, regulations, or business needs. We apply the methodology to two applications, resulting in a deployment of the Explanation Assistant demonstrating explanations capabilities. Finally, the associated development costs are measured, showing that the approach to construct explanations is tractable in terms of development time, which can be as low as two hours per explanation sentence.

**Abstract:** It is generally believed that the human visual system is biased towards the recognition of shapes rather than textures. This assumption has led to a growing body of work aiming to align deep models' decision-making processes with the fundamental properties of human vision. The reliance on shape features is primarily expected to improve the robustness of these models under covariate shift. In this paper, we revisit the significance of shape-biases for the classification of skin lesion images. Our analysis shows that different skin lesion datasets exhibit varying biases towards individual image features. Interestingly, despite deep feature extractors being inclined towards learning entangled features for skin lesion classification, individual features can still be decoded from this entangled representation. This indicates that these features are still represented in the learnt embedding spaces of the models, but not used for classification. In addition, the spectral analysis of different datasets shows that in contrast to common visual recognition, dermoscopic skin lesion classification, by nature, is reliant on complex feature combinations beyond shape-bias. As a natural consequence, shifting away from the prevalent desire of shape-biasing models can even improve skin lesion classifiers in some cases.

**Abstract:** Training computer-vision related algorithms on medical images for disease diagnosis or image segmentation is difficult in large part due to privacy concerns. For this reason, generative image models are highly sought after to facilitate data sharing. However, 3-D generative models are understudied, and investigation of their privacy leakage is needed. We introduce our 3-D generative model, Transversal GAN (TrGAN), using head & neck PET images which are conditioned on tumour masks as a case study. We define quantitative measures of image fidelity, utility and privacy for our model. These metrics are evaluated in the course of training to identify ideal fidelity, utility and privacy trade-offs and establish the relationships between these parameters. We show that the discriminator of the TrGAN is vulnerable to attack, and that an attacker can identify which samples were used in training with almost perfect accuracy (AUC = 0.99). We also show that an attacker with access to only the generator cannot reliably classify whether a sample had been used for training (AUC = 0.51). This suggests that TrGAN generators, but not discriminators, may be used for sharing synthetic 3-D PET data with minimal privacy risk while maintaining good utility and fidelity.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel method to automatically calibrate tracked ultrasound probes. To this end we design a custom phantom consisting of nine cones with different heights. The tips are used as key points to be matched between multiple sweeps. We extract them using a convolutional neural network to segment the cones in every ultrasound frame and then track them across the sweep. The calibration is robustly estimated using RANSAC and later refined employing image based techniques. Our phantom can be 3D-printed and offers many advantages over state-of-the-art methods. The phantom design and algorithm code are freely available online. Since our phantom does not require a tracking target on itself, ease of use is improved over currently used techniques. The fully automatic method generalizes to new probes and different vendors, as shown in our experiments. Our approach produces results comparable to calibrations obtained by a domain expert.

**Abstract:** High-fidelity reconstruction of fluids from sparse multiview RGB videos remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the underlying physics as well as complex occlusion and lighting in captures. Existing solutions either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics (ie, Navier -Stokes equations) in an end-to-end optimization from sparse videos without taking lighting conditions, geometry information, or boundary conditions as input. We provide a continuous spatio-temporal scene representation using neural networks as the ansatz of density and velocity solution functions for fluids as well as the radiance field for static objects. With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid interactions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without additional geometry input or human labeling. By augmenting time-varying neural radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization from sparse views, we introduced a layer-by-layer growing strategy to progressively increase the network capacity. Using progressively growing models with a new regularization term, we manage to disentangle density-color ambiguity in radiance fields without overfitting. A pretrained density-to-velocity fluid model is leveraged in addition as the data prior to avoid suboptimal velocity which underestimates vorticity but trivially fulfills physical equations. Our method exhibits high-quality results with relaxed constraints and strong flexibility on a representative set of synthetic and real flow captures.

**Abstract:** Face anti-spoofing has drawn a lot of attention due to the high security requirements in biometric authentication systems. Bringing face biometric to commercial hardware became mostly dependent on developing reliable methods for detecting fake login sessions without specialized sensors. Current CNN-based method perform well on the domains they were trained for, but often show poor generalization on previously unseen datasets. In this paper we describe a method for utilizing unsupervised pretraining for improving performance across multiple datasets without any adaptation, introduce the Entry Antispoofing Dataset for supervised fine-tuning, and propose a multi-class auxiliary classification layer for augmenting the binary classification task of detecting spoofing attempts with explicit interpretable signals. We demonstrate the efficiency of our model by achieving state-of-the-art results on cross-dataset testing on MSU-MFSD, Replay-Attack, and OULU-NPU datasets.

**Abstract:** In computational reinforcement learning, a growing body of work seeks to construct an agent's perception of the world through predictions of future sensations; predictions about environment observations are used as additional input features to enable better goal-directed decision-making. An open challenge in this line of work is determining from the infinitely many predictions that the agent could possibly make which predictions might best support decision-making. This challenge is especially apparent in continual learning problems where a single stream of experience is available to a singular agent. As a primary contribution, we introduce a meta-gradient descent process by which an agent learns 1) what predictions to make, 2) the estimates for its chosen predictions, and 3) how to use those estimates to generate policies that maximize future reward -- all during a single ongoing process of continual learning. In this manuscript we consider predictions expressed as General Value Functions: temporally extended estimates of the accumulation of a future signal. We demonstrate that through interaction with the environment an agent can independently select predictions that resolve partial-observability, resulting in performance similar to expertly specified GVFs. By learning, rather than manually specifying these predictions, we enable the agent to identify useful predictions in a self-supervised manner, taking a step towards truly autonomous systems.

**Abstract:** The remarkable success of reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on observing the reward of every visited state-action pair. In many real world applications, however, an agent can observe only a score that represents the quality of the whole trajectory, which is referred to as the {\em trajectory-wise reward}. In such a situation, it is difficult for standard RL methods to well utilize trajectory-wise reward, and large bias and variance errors can be incurred in policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm, called Pessimistic vAlue iteRaTion with rEward Decomposition (PARTED), which decomposes the trajectory return into per-step proxy rewards via least-squares-based reward redistribution, and then performs pessimistic value iteration based on the learned proxy reward. To ensure the value functions constructed by PARTED are always pessimistic with respect to the optimal ones, we design a new penalty term to offset the uncertainty of the proxy reward. For general episodic MDPs with large state space, we show that PARTED with overparameterized neural network function approximation achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(D_{\text{eff}}H^2/\sqrt{N})$ suboptimality, where $H$ is the length of episode, $N$ is the total number of samples, and $D_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective dimension of the neural tangent kernel matrix. To further illustrate the result, we show that PARTED achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(dH^3/\sqrt{N})$ suboptimality with linear MDPs, where $d$ is the feature dimension, which matches with that with neural network function approximation, when $D_{\text{eff}}=dH$. To the best of our knowledge, PARTED is the first offline RL algorithm that is provably efficient in general MDP with trajectory-wise reward.

**Abstract:** Beginning with Turing's seminal work in 1950, artificial intelligence proposes that consciousness can be simulated by a Turing machine. This implies a potential theory of everything where the universe is a simulation on a computer, which begs the question of whether we can prove we exist in a simulation. In this work, we construct a relative model of computation where a computable \textit{local} machine is simulated by a \textit{global}, classical Turing machine. We show that the problem of the local machine computing \textbf{simulation properties} of its global simulator is undecidable in the same sense as the Halting problem. Then, we show that computing the time, space, or error accumulated by the global simulator are simulation properties and therefore are undecidable. These simulation properties give rise to special relativistic effects in the relative model which we use to construct a relative Church-Turing-Deutsch thesis where a global, classical Turing machine computes quantum mechanics for a local machine with the same constant-time local computational complexity as experienced in our universe.

**Abstract:** The task of unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to cluster pixels into semantically meaningful groups. Specifically, pixels assigned to the same cluster should share high-level semantic properties like their object or part category. This paper presents MaskDistill: a novel framework for unsupervised semantic segmentation based on three key ideas. First, we advocate a data-driven strategy to generate object masks that serve as a pixel grouping prior for semantic segmentation. This approach omits handcrafted priors, which are often designed for specific scene compositions and limit the applicability of competing frameworks. Second, MaskDistill clusters the object masks to obtain pseudo-ground-truth for training an initial object segmentation model. Third, we leverage this model to filter out low-quality object masks. This strategy mitigates the noise in our pixel grouping prior and results in a clean collection of masks which we use to train a final segmentation model. By combining these components, we can considerably outperform previous works for unsupervised semantic segmentation on PASCAL (+11% mIoU) and COCO (+4% mask AP50). Interestingly, as opposed to existing approaches, our framework does not latch onto low-level image cues and is not limited to object-centric datasets. The code and models will be made available.

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been regarded as the go-to models for visual recognition. More recently, convolution-free networks, based on multi-head self-attention (MSA) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), become more and more popular. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when utilizing these newly-minted networks for video recognition due to the large variations and complexities in video data. In this paper, we present MLP-3D networks, a novel MLP-like 3D architecture for video recognition. Specifically, the architecture consists of MLP-3D blocks, where each block contains one MLP applied across tokens (i.e., token-mixing MLP) and one MLP applied independently to each token (i.e., channel MLP). By deriving the novel grouped time mixing (GTM) operations, we equip the basic token-mixing MLP with the ability of temporal modeling. GTM divides the input tokens into several temporal groups and linearly maps the tokens in each group with the shared projection matrix. Furthermore, we devise several variants of GTM with different grouping strategies, and compose each variant in different blocks of MLP-3D network by greedy architecture search. Without the dependence on convolutions or attention mechanisms, our MLP-3D networks achieves 68.5\%/81.4\% top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets, respectively. Despite with fewer computations, the results are comparable to state-of-the-art widely-used 3D CNNs and video transformers. Source code is available at https://github.com/ZhaofanQiu/MLP-3D.

**Abstract:** This paper presents an overview and comparative analysis of our systems designed for the following two tracks in SAPIEN ManiSkill Challenge 2021:
  No Interaction Track: The No Interaction track targets for learning policies from pre-collected demonstration trajectories. We investigate both imitation learning-based approach, i.e., imitating the observed behavior using classical supervised learning techniques, and offline reinforcement learning-based approaches, for this track. Moreover, the geometry and texture structures of objects and robotic arms are exploited via Transformer-based networks to facilitate imitation learning.
  No Restriction Track: In this track, we design a Heuristic Rule-based Method (HRM) to trigger high-quality object manipulation by decomposing the task into a series of sub-tasks. For each sub-task, the simple rule-based controlling strategies are adopted to predict actions that can be applied to robotic arms.

<p>

**Abstract:** Top Two algorithms arose as an adaptation of Thompson sampling to best arm identification in multi-armed bandit models (Russo, 2016), for parametric families of arms. They select the next arm to sample from by randomizing among two candidate arms, a leader and a challenger. Despite their good empirical performance, theoretical guarantees for fixed-confidence best arm identification have only been obtained when the arms are Gaussian with known variances. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of Top Two methods, which identifies desirable properties of the leader, the challenger, and the (possibly non-parametric) distributions of the arms. As a result, we obtain theoretically supported Top Two algorithms for best arm identification with bounded distributions. Our proof method demonstrates in particular that the sampling step used to select the leader inherited from Thompson sampling can be replaced by other choices, like selecting the empirical best arm.

**Abstract:** We present a motion planning algorithm for a class of uncertain control-affine nonlinear systems which guarantees runtime safety and goal reachability when using high-dimensional sensor measurements (e.g., RGB-D images) and a learned perception module in the feedback control loop. First, given a dataset of states and observations, we train a perception system that seeks to invert a subset of the state from an observation, and estimate an upper bound on the perception error which is valid with high probability in a trusted domain near the data. Next, we use contraction theory to design a stabilizing state feedback controller and a convergent dynamic state observer which uses the learned perception system to update its state estimate. We derive a bound on the trajectory tracking error when this controller is subjected to errors in the dynamics and incorrect state estimates. Finally, we integrate this bound into a sampling-based motion planner, guiding it to return trajectories that can be safely tracked at runtime using sensor data. We demonstrate our approach in simulation on a 4D car, a 6D planar quadrotor, and a 17D manipulation task with RGB(-D) sensor measurements, demonstrating that our method safely and reliably steers the system to the goal, while baselines that fail to consider the trusted domain or state estimation errors can be unsafe.

**Abstract:** Robots excel in performing repetitive and precision-sensitive tasks in controlled environments such as warehouses and factories, but have not been yet extended to embodied AI agents providing assistance in household tasks. Inspired by the catalyzing effect that benchmarks have played in the AI fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, the community is looking for new benchmarks for embodied AI. Prior work in embodied AI benchmark defines tasks using a different formalism, often specific to one environment, simulator or domain, making it hard to develop general and comparable solutions. In this work, we bring a subset of BEHAVIOR activities into Habitat 2.0 to benefit from its fast simulation speed, as a first step towards demonstrating the ease of adapting activities defined in the logic space into different simulators.

**Abstract:** Modern multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models have shown competitive results in learning visual representations without self-attention. However, existing MLP models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of human configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific demand while also allowing for both local and global spatial interactions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GraphMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Our source code and pretrained models will be publicly available.

**Abstract:** Purpose: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging indicates direct and absolute measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Arterial transit time (ATT) is a related physiological parameter reflecting the duration for the labeled spins to reach the brain region of interest. Multiple post-labeling delay (PLDs) can provide robust measures of both CBF and ATT, allowing for optimization of regional CBF modeling based on ATT. The prolonged acquisition time can potentially reduce the quality and accuracy of the CBF and ATT estimation. We proposed a novel network to significantly reduce the number of PLDs with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Method: CBF and ATT estimations were performed for one PLD and two PLDs sepa-rately. Each model was trained independently to learn the nonlinear transformation from perfusion weighted image (PWI) to CBF and ATT images. Results: Both one-PLD and two-PLD models outperformed the conventional method visually on CBF and two-PLD model showed more accurate structure on ATT estima-tion. The proposed method significantly reduces the number of PLDs from 6 to 2 on ATT and even to single PLD on CBF without sacrificing the SNR. Conclusion: It is feasible to generate CBF and ATT maps with reduced PLDs using deep learning with high quality.

**Abstract:** Recent state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised learning (SSL) combine consistency regularization with confidence-based pseudo-labeling. To obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, a high confidence threshold is typically adopted. However, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep networks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data, and thus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may still be unreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of pseudo-labeling: instead of relying on model confidence, we instead measure whether an unlabeled sample is likely to be "in-distribution"; i.e., close to the current training data. To classify whether an unlabeled sample is "in-distribution" or "out-of-distribution", we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution detection literature. As training progresses and more unlabeled samples become in-distribution and contribute to training, the combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data can better approximate the true distribution to improve the model. Experiments demonstrate that our energy-based pseudo-labeling method, albeit conceptually simple, significantly outperforms confidence-based methods on imbalanced SSL benchmarks, and achieves competitive performance on class-balanced data. For example, it produces a 4-6% absolute accuracy improvement on CIFAR10-LT when the imbalance ratio is higher than 50. When combined with state-of-the-art long-tailed SSL methods, further improvements are attained.

**Abstract:** Subject motion in whole-body dynamic PET introduces inter-frame mismatch and seriously impacts parametric imaging. Traditional non-rigid registration methods are generally computationally intense and time-consuming. Deep learning approaches are promising in achieving high accuracy with fast speed, but have yet been investigated with consideration for tracer distribution changes or in the whole-body scope. In this work, we developed an unsupervised automatic deep learning-based framework to correct inter-frame body motion. The motion estimation network is a convolutional neural network with a combined convolutional long short-term memory layer, fully utilizing dynamic temporal features and spatial information. Our dataset contains 27 subjects each under a 90-min FDG whole-body dynamic PET scan. With 9-fold cross-validation, compared with both traditional and deep learning baselines, we demonstrated that the proposed network obtained superior performance in enhanced qualitative and quantitative spatial alignment between parametric $K_{i}$ and $V_{b}$ images and in significantly reduced parametric fitting error. We also showed the potential of the proposed motion correction method for impacting downstream analysis of the estimated parametric images, improving the ability to distinguish malignant from benign hypermetabolic regions of interest. Once trained, the motion estimation inference time of our proposed network was around 460 times faster than the conventional registration baseline, showing its potential to be easily applied in clinical settings.

**Abstract:** Recent high-performing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection techniques have been highly influenced by Transformer-based object detector (i.e., DETR). Nevertheless, most of them directly map parametric interaction queries into a set of HOI predictions through vanilla Transformer in a one-stage manner. This leaves rich inter- or intra-interaction structure under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel Transformer-style HOI detector, i.e., Structure-aware Transformer over Interaction Proposals (STIP), for HOI detection. Such design decomposes the process of HOI set prediction into two subsequent phases, i.e., an interaction proposal generation is first performed, and then followed by transforming the non-parametric interaction proposals into HOI predictions via a structure-aware Transformer. The structure-aware Transformer upgrades vanilla Transformer by encoding additionally the holistically semantic structure among interaction proposals as well as the locally spatial structure of human/object within each interaction proposal, so as to strengthen HOI predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of STIP, and superior results are reported when comparing with the state-of-the-art HOI detectors.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) now enables automated interpretation of medical images for clinical use. However, AI's potential use for interventional images (versus those involved in triage or diagnosis), such as for guidance during surgery, remains largely untapped. This is because surgical AI systems are currently trained using post hoc analysis of data collected during live surgeries, which has fundamental and practical limitations, including ethical considerations, expense, scalability, data integrity, and a lack of ground truth. Here, we demonstrate that creating realistic simulated images from human models is a viable alternative and complement to large-scale in situ data collection. We show that training AI image analysis models on realistically synthesized data, combined with contemporary domain generalization or adaptation techniques, results in models that on real data perform comparably to models trained on a precisely matched real data training set. Because synthetic generation of training data from human-based models scales easily, we find that our model transfer paradigm for X-ray image analysis, which we refer to as SyntheX, can even outperform real data-trained models due to the effectiveness of training on a larger dataset. We demonstrate the potential of SyntheX on three clinical tasks: Hip image analysis, surgical robotic tool detection, and COVID-19 lung lesion segmentation. SyntheX provides an opportunity to drastically accelerate the conception, design, and evaluation of intelligent systems for X-ray-based medicine. In addition, simulated image environments provide the opportunity to test novel instrumentation, design complementary surgical approaches, and envision novel techniques that improve outcomes, save time, or mitigate human error, freed from the ethical and practical considerations of live human data collection.

**Abstract:** We introduce a general framework for Markov decision problems under model uncertainty in a discrete-time infinite horizon setting. By providing a dynamic programming principle we obtain a local-to-global paradigm, namely solving a local, i.e., a one time-step robust optimization problem leads to an optimizer of the global (i.e. infinite time-steps) robust stochastic optimal control problem, as well as to a corresponding worst-case measure. Moreover, we apply this framework to portfolio optimization involving data of the S&P 500. We present two different types of ambiguity sets; one is fully data-driven given by a Wasserstein-ball around the empirical measure, the second one is described by a parametric set of multivariate normal distributions, where the corresponding uncertainty sets of the parameters are estimated from the data. It turns out that in scenarios where the market is volatile or bearish, the optimal portfolio strategies from the corresponding robust optimization problem outperforms the ones without model uncertainty, showcasing the importance of taking model uncertainty into account.

**Abstract:** Despite the extensive studies on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), how to reliably sample high-quality images from their latent spaces remains an under-explored topic. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN latent sampling method by exploring and exploiting the hubness priors of GAN latent distributions. Our key insight is that the high dimensionality of the GAN latent space will inevitably lead to the emergence of hub latents that usually have much larger sampling densities than other latents in the latent space. As a result, these hub latents are better trained and thus contribute more to the synthesis of high-quality images. Unlike the a posterior "cherry-picking", our method is highly efficient as it is an a priori method that identifies high-quality latents before the synthesis of images. Furthermore, we show that the well-known but purely empirical truncation trick is a naive approximation to the central clustering effect of hub latents, which not only uncovers the rationale of the truncation trick, but also indicates the superiority and fundamentality of our method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** Attention guidance is an approach to addressing dataset bias in deep learning, where the model relies on incorrect features to make decisions. Focusing on image classification tasks, we propose an efficient human-in-the-loop system to interactively direct the attention of classifiers to the regions specified by users, thereby reducing the influence of co-occurrence bias and improving the transferability and interpretability of a DNN. Previous approaches for attention guidance require the preparation of pixel-level annotations and are not designed as interactive systems. We present a new interactive method to allow users to annotate images with simple clicks, and study a novel active learning strategy to significantly reduce the number of annotations. We conducted both a numerical evaluation and a user study to evaluate the proposed system on multiple datasets. Compared to the existing non-active-learning approach which usually relies on huge amounts of polygon-based segmentation masks to fine-tune or train the DNNs, our system can save lots of labor and money and obtain a fine-tuned network that works better even when the dataset is biased. The experiment results indicate that the proposed system is efficient, reasonable, and reliable.

**Abstract:** Autonomous scene exposure and exploration, especially in localization or communication-denied areas, useful for finding targets in unknown scenes, remains a challenging problem in computer navigation. In this work, we present a novel method for real-time environment exploration, whose only requirements are a visually similar dataset for pre-training, enough lighting in the scene, and an on-board forward-looking RGB camera for environmental sensing. As opposed to existing methods, our method requires only one look (image) to make a good tactical decision, and therefore works at a non-growing, constant time. Two direction predictions, characterized by pixels dubbed the Goto and Lookat pixels, comprise the core of our method. These pixels encode the recommended flight instructions in the following way: the Goto pixel defines the direction in which the agent should move by one distance unit, and the Lookat pixel defines the direction in which the camera should be pointing at in the next step. These flying-instruction pixels are optimized to expose the largest amount of currently unexplored areas.
  Our method presents a novel deep learning-based navigation approach that is able to solve this problem and demonstrate its ability in an even more complicated setup, i.e., when computational power is limited. In addition, we propose a way to generate a navigation-oriented dataset, enabling efficient training of our method using RGB and depth images. Tests conducted in a simulator evaluating both the sparse pixels' coordinations inferring process, and 2D and 3D test flights aimed to unveil areas and decrease distances to targets achieve promising results. Comparison against a state-of-the-art algorithm shows our method is able to overperform it, that while measuring the new voxels per camera pose, minimum distance to target, percentage of surface voxels seen, and compute time metrics.

**Abstract:** In recent years, many practitioners in quantitative finance have attempted to use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to build better quantitative trading (QT) strategies. Nevertheless, many existing studies fail to address several serious challenges, such as the non-stationary financial environment and the bias and variance trade-off when applying DRL in the real financial market. In this work, we proposed Safe-FinRL, a novel DRL-based high-freq stock trading strategy enhanced by the near-stationary financial environment and low bias and variance estimation. Our main contributions are twofold: firstly, we separate the long financial time series into the near-stationary short environment; secondly, we implement Trace-SAC in the near-stationary financial environment by incorporating the general retrace operator into the Soft Actor-Critic. Extensive experiments on the cryptocurrency market have demonstrated that Safe-FinRL has provided a stable value estimation and a steady policy improvement and reduced bias and variance significantly in the near-stationary financial environment.

**Abstract:** Interpretability methods for deep neural networks mainly focus on the sensitivity of the class score with respect to the original or perturbed input, usually measured using actual or modified gradients. Some methods also use a model-agnostic approach to understanding the rationale behind every prediction. In this paper, we argue and demonstrate that local geometry of the model parameter space relative to the input can also be beneficial for improved post-hoc explanations. To achieve this goal, we introduce an interpretability method called "geometrically-guided integrated gradients" that builds on top of the gradient calculation along a linear path as traditionally used in integrated gradient methods. However, instead of integrating gradient information, our method explores the model's dynamic behavior from multiple scaled versions of the input and captures the best possible attribution for each input. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed approach outperforms vanilla and integrated gradients in subjective and quantitative assessment. We also propose a "model perturbation" sanity check to complement the traditionally used "model randomization" test.

**Abstract:** Multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) extends traditional knowledge distillation to the area of multimodal learning. One common practice is to adopt a well-performed multimodal network as the teacher in the hope that it can transfer its full knowledge to a unimodal student for performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of multimodal KD. We begin by providing two failure cases of it and demonstrate that KD is not a universal cure in multimodal knowledge transfer. We present the modality Venn diagram to understand modality relationships and the modality focusing hypothesis revealing the decisive factor in the efficacy of multimodal KD. Experimental results on 6 multimodal datasets help justify our hypothesis, diagnose failure cases, and point directions to improve distillation performance.

**Abstract:** Advances in neuroimaging techniques have provided us novel insights into understanding how the human mind works. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most popular and widely used neuroimaging technique, and there is growing interest in fMRI-based markers of individual differences. However, its utility is often limited due to its high cost and difficulty acquiring from specific populations, including children and infants. Surrogate markers, or neural correlates of fMRI markers, would have important practical implications, but we have few stand-alone predictors for the fMRI markers. Here, using machine learning (ML) models and data augmentation, we predicted well-validated fMRI markers of human cognition from multivariate patterns of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a portable and relatively inexpensive optical neuroimaging technique. We recruited 50 human participants who performed two cognitive tasks (stop signal task and probabilistic reversal learning task), while neural activation was measured with either fNIRS or fMRI at each of the total two visits. Using ML models and data augmentation, we could predict the well-established fMRI markers of response inhibition or prediction error signals from 48-channel fNIRS activation in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that fNIRS might offer a surrogate marker of fMRI activation, which would broaden our understanding of various populations, including infants.

For both metrics, several statements related to characterization and volume properties of the set of optimal segmentations are proved, and associated experiments are provided. Our main insights are: (i) the volume of the solutions to both metrics may deviate significantly from the expected volume of the target, (ii) the volume of a solution to Accuracy is always less than or equal to the volume of a solution to Dice and (iii) the optimal solutions to both of these metrics coincide when the set of feasible segmentations is constrained to the set of segmentations with the volume equal to the expected volume of the target.

**Abstract:** Bayesian methods are a popular choice for statistical inference in small-data regimes due to the regularization effect induced by the prior, which serves to counteract overfitting. In the context of density estimation, the standard Bayesian approach is to target the posterior predictive. In general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable and so methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an intermediate step. The recent development of recursive predictive copula updates, however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density estimation without the need for posterior approximation. Although these estimators are computationally appealing, they tend to struggle on non-smooth data distributions. This is largely due to the comparatively restrictive form of the likelihood models from which the proposed copula updates were derived. To address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric model with an autoregressive likelihood decomposition and Gaussian process prior, which yields a data-dependent bandwidth parameter in the copula update. Further, we formulate a novel parameterization of the bandwidth using an autoregressive neural network that maps the data into a latent space, and is thus able to capture more complex dependencies in the data. Our extensions increase the modelling capacity of existing recursive Bayesian density estimators, achieving state-of-the-art results on tabular data sets.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised representation learning maps high-dimensional data into a meaningful embedding space, where samples of similar semantic contents are close to each other. Most of the recent representation learning methods maximize cosine similarity or minimize the distance between the embedding features of different views from the same sample usually on the $l2$ normalized unit hypersphere. To prevent the trivial solutions that all samples have the same embedding feature, various techniques have been developed, such as contrastive learning, stop gradient, variance and covariance regularization, etc. In this study, we propose MUlti-Segmental Informational Coding (MUSIC) for self-supervised representation learning. MUSIC divides the embedding feature into multiple segments that discriminatively partition samples into different semantic clusters and different segments focus on different partition principles. Information theory measurements are directly used to optimize MUSIC and theoretically guarantee trivial solutions are avoided. MUSIC does not depend on commonly used techniques, such as memory bank or large batches, asymmetry networks, gradient stopping, momentum weight updating, etc, making the training framework flexible. Our experiments demonstrate that MUSIC achieves better results than most related Barlow Twins and VICReg methods on ImageNet classification with linear probing, and requires neither deep projectors nor large feature dimensions. Code will be made available.

**Abstract:** Minimizing the inclusive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is challenging since its gradient is defined as an integral over the posterior. Recently, multiple methods have been proposed to run SGD with biased gradient estimates obtained from a Markov chain. This paper provides the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis of these methods by establishing their mixing rate and gradient variance. To do this, we demonstrate that these methods-which we collectively refer to as Markov chain score ascent (MCSA) methods-can be cast as special cases of the Markov chain gradient descent framework. Furthermore, by leveraging this new understanding, we develop a novel MCSA scheme, parallel MCSA (pMCSA), that achieves a tighter bound on the gradient variance. We demonstrate that this improved theoretical result translates to superior empirical performance.

**Abstract:** Self-training for unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is a challenging task, of which the performance depends heavily on the quality of pseudo boxes. Despite the promising results, prior works have largely overlooked the uncertainty of pseudo boxes during self-training. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective framework, termed as Probabilistic Teacher (PT), which aims to capture the uncertainty of unlabeled target data from a gradually evolving teacher and guides the learning of a student in a mutually beneficial manner. Specifically, we propose to leverage the uncertainty-guided consistency training to promote classification adaptation and localization adaptation, rather than filtering pseudo boxes via an elaborate confidence threshold. In addition, we conduct anchor adaptation in parallel with localization adaptation, since anchor can be regarded as a learnable parameter. Together with this framework, we also present a novel Entropy Focal Loss (EFL) to further facilitate the uncertainty-guided self-training. Equipped with EFL, PT outperforms all previous baselines by a large margin and achieve new state-of-the-arts.

**Abstract:** The detection and removal of precancerous polyps through colonoscopy is the primary technique for the prevention of colorectal cancer worldwide. However, the miss rate of colorectal polyp varies significantly among the endoscopists. It is well known that a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system can assist endoscopists in detecting colon polyps and minimize the variation among endoscopists. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, named {\textbf{MKDCNet}}, for automatic polyp segmentation robust to significant changes in polyp data distribution. MKDCNet is simply an encoder-decoder neural network that uses the pre-trained \textit{ResNet50} as the encoder and novel \textit{multiple kernel dilated convolution (MKDC)} block that expands the field of view to learn more robust and heterogeneous representation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available polyp datasets and cell nuclei dataset show that the proposed MKDCNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods when trained and tested on the same dataset as well when tested on unseen polyp datasets from different distributions. With rich results, we demonstrated the robustness of the proposed architecture. From an efficiency perspective, our algorithm can process at ($\approx45$) frames per second on RTX 3090 GPU. MKDCNet can be a strong benchmark for building real-time systems for clinical colonoscopies. The code of the proposed MKDCNet is available at \url{https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/MKDCNet}.

**Abstract:** In clinical practice, anisotropic volumetric medical images with low through-plane resolution are commonly used due to short acquisition time and lower storage cost. Nevertheless, the coarse resolution may lead to difficulties in medical diagnosis by either physicians or computer-aided diagnosis algorithms. Deep learning-based volumetric super-resolution (SR) methods are feasible ways to improve resolution, with convolutional neural networks (CNN) at their core. Despite recent progress, these methods are limited by inherent properties of convolution operators, which ignore content relevance and cannot effectively model long-range dependencies. In addition, most of the existing methods use pseudo-paired volumes for training and evaluation, where pseudo low-resolution (LR) volumes are generated by a simple degradation of their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. However, the domain gap between pseudo- and real-LR volumes leads to the poor performance of these methods in practice. In this paper, we build the first public real-paired dataset RPLHR-CT as a benchmark for volumetric SR, and provide baseline results by re-implementing four state-of-the-art CNN-based methods. Considering the inherent shortcoming of CNN, we also propose a transformer volumetric super-resolution network (TVSRN) based on attention mechanisms, dispensing with convolutions entirely. This is the first research to use a pure transformer for CT volumetric SR. The experimental results show that TVSRN significantly outperforms all baselines on both PSNR and SSIM. Moreover, the TVSRN method achieves a better trade-off between the image quality, the number of parameters, and the running time.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a new efficient black-box attribution method based on Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), a dependence measure based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). HSIC measures the dependence between regions of an input image and the output of a model based on kernel embeddings of distributions. It thus provides explanations enriched by RKHS representation capabilities. HSIC can be estimated very efficiently, significantly reducing the computational cost compared to other black-box attribution methods. Our experiments show that HSIC is up to 8 times faster than the previous best black-box attribution methods while being as faithful. Indeed, we improve or match the state-of-the-art of both black-box and white-box attribution methods for several fidelity metrics on Imagenet with various recent model architectures. Importantly, we show that these advances can be transposed to efficiently and faithfully explain object detection models such as YOLOv4. Finally, we extend the traditional attribution methods by proposing a new kernel enabling an orthogonal decomposition of importance scores based on HSIC, allowing us to evaluate not only the importance of each image patch but also the importance of their pairwise interactions.

**Abstract:** Inspired by the remarkable zero-shot generalization capacity of vision-language pre-trained model, we seek to leverage the supervision from CLIP model to alleviate the burden of data labeling. However, such supervision inevitably contains the label noise, which significantly degrades the discriminative power of the classification model. In this work, we propose Transductive CLIP, a novel framework for learning a classification network with noisy labels from scratch. Firstly, a class-conditional contrastive learning mechanism is proposed to mitigate the reliance on pseudo labels and boost the tolerance to noisy labels. Secondly, ensemble labels is adopted as a pseudo label updating strategy to stabilize the training of deep neural networks with noisy labels. This framework can reduce the impact of noisy labels from CLIP model effectively by combining both techniques. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Causal representation learning is the task of identifying the underlying causal variables and their relations from high-dimensional observations, such as images. Recent work has shown that one can reconstruct the causal variables from temporal sequences of observations under the assumption that there are no instantaneous causal relations between them. In practical applications, however, our measurement or frame rate might be slower than many of the causal effects. This effectively creates "instantaneous" effects and invalidates previous identifiability results. To address this issue, we propose iCITRIS, a causal representation learning method that can handle instantaneous effects in temporal sequences when given perfect interventions with known intervention targets. iCITRIS identifies the causal factors from temporal observations, while simultaneously using a differentiable causal discovery method to learn their causal graph. In experiments on three video datasets, iCITRIS accurately identifies the causal factors and their causal graph.

**Abstract:** Background: The complex heterogeneity of brain tumours is increasingly recognized to demand data of magnitudes and richness only fully-inclusive, large-scale collections drawn from routine clinical care could plausibly offer. This is a task contemporary machine learning could facilitate, especially in neuroimaging, but its ability to deal with incomplete data common in real world clinical practice remains unknown. Here we apply state-of-the-art methods to large scale, multi-site MRI data to quantify the comparative fidelity of automated tumour segmentation models replicating the various levels of completeness observed in clinical reality.
  Methods: We compare deep learning (nnU-Net-derived) tumour segmentation models with all possible combinations of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and FLAIR imaging sequences, trained and validated with five-fold cross-validation on the 2021 BraTS-RSNA glioma population of 1251 patients, and tested on a diverse, real-world 50 patient sample.
  Results: Models trained on incomplete data segmented lesions well, often equivalently to those trained on complete data, exhibiting Dice coefficients of 0.907 (single sequence) to 0.945 (full datasets) for whole tumours, and 0.701 (single sequence) to 0.891 (full datasets) for component tissue types. Incomplete data segmentation models could accurately detect enhancing tumour in the absence of contrast imaging, quantifying its volume with an R2 between 0.95-0.97.
  Conclusions: Deep learning segmentation models characterize tumours well when missing data and can even detect enhancing tissue without the use of contrast. This suggests translation to clinical practice, where incomplete data is common, may be easier than hitherto believed, and may be of value in reducing dependence on contrast use.

**Abstract:** CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world's largest producers of cocoa, account for two thirds of the global cocoa production. In both countries, cocoa is the primary perennial crop, providing income to almost two million farmers. Yet precise maps of cocoa planted area are missing, hindering accurate quantification of expansion in protected areas, production and yields, and limiting information available for improved sustainability governance. Here, we combine cocoa plantation data with publicly available satellite imagery in a deep learning framework and create high-resolution maps of cocoa plantations for both countries, validated in situ. Our results suggest that cocoa cultivation is an underlying driver of over 37% and 13% of forest loss in protected areas in CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively, and that official reports substantially underestimate the planted area, up to 40% in Ghana. These maps serve as a crucial building block to advance understanding of conservation and economic development in cocoa producing regions.

**Abstract:** Fully unsupervised 3D representation learning has gained attention owing to its advantages in data collection. A successful approach involves a viewpoint-aware approach that learns an image distribution based on generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) while generating various view images based on 3D-aware models (e.g., neural radiance fields (NeRFs)). However, they require images with various views for training, and consequently, their application to datasets with few or limited viewpoints remains a challenge. As a complementary approach, an aperture rendering GAN (AR-GAN) that employs a defocus cue was proposed. However, an AR-GAN is a CNN-based model and represents a defocus independently from a viewpoint change despite its high correlation, which is one of the reasons for its performance. As an alternative to an AR-GAN, we propose an aperture rendering NeRF (AR-NeRF), which can utilize viewpoint and defocus cues in a unified manner by representing both factors in a common ray-tracing framework. Moreover, to learn defocus-aware and defocus-independent representations in a disentangled manner, we propose aperture randomized training, for which we learn to generate images while randomizing the aperture size and latent codes independently. During our experiments, we applied AR-NeRF to various natural image datasets, including flower, bird, and face images, the results of which demonstrate the utility of AR-NeRF for unsupervised learning of the depth and defocus effects.

**Abstract:** In this report, we presents low-complexity deep learning frameworks for acoustic scene classification (ASC). The proposed frameworks can be separated into four main steps: Front-end spectrogram extraction, online data augmentation, back-end classification, and late fusion of predicted probabilities. In particular, we initially transform audio recordings into Mel, Gammatone, and CQT spectrograms. Next, data augmentation methods of Random Cropping, Specaugment, and Mixup are then applied to generate augmented spectrograms before being fed into deep learning based classifiers. Finally, to achieve the best performance, we fuse probabilities which obtained from three individual classifiers, which are independently-trained with three type of spectrograms. Our experiments conducted on DCASE 2022 Task 1 Development dataset have fullfiled the requirement of low-complexity and achieved the best classification accuracy of 60.1%, improving DCASE baseline by 17.2%.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised Learning (SSL) has recently gained much attention due to the high cost and data limitation in the training of supervised learning models. The current paradigm in the SSL is to utilize data augmentation at the input space to create different views of the same images and train a model to maximize the representations between similar images and minimize them for different ones. While this approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks, it still lakes the opportunity to investigate the latent space augmentation. This paper proposes TriMix, a novel concept for SSL that generates virtual embeddings through linear interpolation of the data, thus providing the model with novel representations. Our strategy focuses on training the model to extract the original embeddings from virtual ones, hence, better representation learning. Additionally, we propose a self-consistency term that improves the consistency between the virtual and actual embeddings. We validate TriMix on eight benchmark datasets consisting of natural and medical images with an improvement of 2.71% and 0.41% better than the second-best models for both data types. Further, our approach outperformed the current methods in semi-supervised learning, particularly in low data regimes. Besides, our pre-trained models showed better transfer to other datasets.

**Abstract:** Options represent a framework for reasoning across multiple time scales in reinforcement learning (RL). With the recent active interest in the unsupervised learning paradigm in the RL research community, the option framework was adapted to utilize the concept of empowerment, which corresponds to the amount of influence the agent has on the environment and its ability to perceive this influence, and which can be optimized without any supervision provided by the environment's reward structure. Many recent papers modify this concept in various ways achieving commendable results. Through these various modifications, however, the initial context of empowerment is often lost. In this work we offer a comparative study of such papers through the lens of the original empowerment principle.

**Abstract:** An accelerated failure time (AFT) model assumes a log-linear relationship between failure times and a set of covariates. In contrast to other popular survival models that work on hazard functions, the effects of covariates are directly on failure times, whose interpretation is intuitive. The semiparametric AFT model that does not specify the error distribution is flexible and robust to departures from the distributional assumption. Owing to the desirable features, this class of models has been considered as a promising alternative to the popular Cox model in the analysis of censored failure time data. However, in these AFT models, a linear predictor for the mean is typically assumed. Little research has addressed the nonlinearity of predictors when modeling the mean. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received a focal attention over the past decades and have achieved remarkable success in a variety of fields. DNNs have a number of notable advantages and have been shown to be particularly useful in addressing the nonlinearity. By taking advantage of this, we propose to apply DNNs in fitting AFT models using a Gehan-type loss, combined with a sub-sampling technique. Finite sample properties of the proposed DNN and rank based AFT model (DeepR-AFT) are investigated via an extensive stimulation study. DeepR-AFT shows a superior performance over its parametric or semiparametric counterparts when the predictor is nonlinear. For linear predictors, DeepR-AFT performs better when the dimensions of covariates are large. The proposed DeepR-AFT is illustrated using two real datasets, which demonstrates its superiority.

**Abstract:** The maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference for determinantal point processes (DPPs) is crucial for selecting diverse items in many machine learning applications. Although DPP MAP inference is NP-hard, the greedy algorithm often finds high-quality solutions, and many researchers have studied its efficient implementation. One classical and practical method is the lazy greedy algorithm, which is applicable to general submodular function maximization, while a recent fast greedy algorithm based on the Cholesky factorization is more efficient for DPP MAP inference. This paper presents how to combine the ideas of "lazy" and "fast", which have been considered incompatible in the literature. Our lazy and fast greedy algorithm achieves almost the same time complexity as the current best one and runs faster in practice. The idea of "lazy + fast" is extendable to other greedy-type algorithms. We also give a fast version of the double greedy algorithm for unconstrained DPP MAP inference. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our acceleration ideas.

**Abstract:** The successful emergence of deep learning (DL) in wireless system applications has raised concerns about new security-related challenges. One such security challenge is adversarial attacks. Although there has been much work demonstrating the susceptibility of DL-based classification tasks to adversarial attacks, regression-based problems in the context of a wireless system have not been studied so far from an attack perspective. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) we consider a regression problem in a wireless setting and show that adversarial attacks can break the DL-based approach and (ii) we analyze the effectiveness of adversarial training as a defensive technique in adversarial settings and show that the robustness of DL-based wireless system against attacks improves significantly. Specifically, the wireless application considered in this paper is the DL-based power allocation in the downlink of a multicell massive multi-input-multi-output system, where the goal of the attack is to yield an infeasible solution by the DL model. We extend the gradient-based adversarial attacks: fast gradient sign method (FGSM), momentum iterative FGSM, and projected gradient descent method to analyze the susceptibility of the considered wireless application with and without adversarial training. We analyze the deep neural network (DNN) models performance against these attacks, where the adversarial perturbations are crafted using both the white-box and black-box attacks.

**Abstract:** Prediction over tabular data is an essential and fundamental problem in many important downstream tasks. However, existing methods either take a data instance of the table independently as input or do not fully utilize the multi-rows features and labels to directly change and enhance the target data representations. In this paper, we propose to 1) construct a hypergraph from relevant data instance retrieval to model the cross-row and cross-column patterns of those instances, and 2) perform message Propagation to Enhance the target data instance representation for Tabular prediction tasks. Specifically, our specially-designed message propagation step benefits from 1) fusion of label and features during propagation, and 2) locality-aware high-order feature interactions. Experiments on two important tabular data prediction tasks validate the superiority of the proposed PET model against other baselines. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model components and the feature enhancement ability of PET via various ablation studies and visualizations.

**Abstract:** Given a cloud of $n$ data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, consider all projections onto $m$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and, for each such projection, the empirical distribution of the projected points. What does this collection of probability distributions look like when $n,d$ grow large?
  We consider this question under the null model in which the points are i.i.d. standard Gaussian vectors, focusing on the asymptotic regime in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n/d\toÎ±\in (0,\infty)$, while $m$ is fixed. Denoting by $\mathscr{F}_{m, Î±}$ the set of probability distributions in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that arise as low-dimensional projections in this limit, we establish new inner and outer bounds on $\mathscr{F}_{m, Î±}$. In particular, we characterize the Wasserstein radius of $\mathscr{F}_{m,Î±}$ up to logarithmic factors, and determine it exactly for $m=1$. We also prove sharp bounds in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence and RÃ©nyi information dimension.
  The previous question has application to unsupervised learning methods, such as projection pursuit and independent component analysis. We introduce a version of the same problem that is relevant for supervised learning, and prove a sharp Wasserstein radius bound. As an application, we establish an upper bound on the interpolation threshold of two-layers neural networks with $m$ hidden neurons.

**Abstract:** Datasets with non-trivial large scale topology can be hard to embed in low-dimensional Euclidean space with existing dimensionality reduction algorithms. We propose to model topologically complex datasets using vector bundles, in such a way that the base space accounts for the large scale topology, while the fibers account for the local geometry. This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view, and, as an application, we describe an algorithm which takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation of it in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations, obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction, along the initial global representation. We demonstrate this algorithm on examples coming from dynamical systems and chemistry. In these examples, our algorithm is able to learn topologically faithful embeddings of the data in lower target dimension than various well known metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms.

**Abstract:** Learning the causal structure behind data is invaluable for improving generalization and obtaining high-quality explanations. We propose a novel framework, Invariant Structure Learning (ISL), that is designed to improve causal structure discovery by utilizing generalization as an indication. ISL splits the data into different environments, and learns a structure that is invariant to the target across different environments by imposing a consistency constraint. An aggregation mechanism then selects the optimal classifier based on a graph structure that reflects the causal mechanisms in the data more accurately compared to the structures learnt from individual environments. Furthermore, we extend ISL to a self-supervised learning setting where accurate causal structure discovery does not rely on any labels. This self-supervised ISL utilizes invariant causality proposals by iteratively setting different nodes as targets. On synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ISL accurately discovers the causal structure, outperforms alternative methods, and yields superior generalization for datasets with significant distribution shifts.

**Abstract:** The inability of artificial neural networks to assess the uncertainty of their predictions is an impediment to their widespread use. We distinguish two types of learnable uncertainty: model uncertainty due to a lack of training data and noise-induced observational uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks use solid mathematical foundations to learn the model uncertainties of their predictions. The observational uncertainty can be calculated by adding one layer to these networks and augmenting their loss functions. Our contribution is to apply these uncertainty concepts to predictive process monitoring tasks to train uncertainty-based models to predict the remaining time and outcomes. Our experiments show that uncertainty estimates allow more and less accurate predictions to be differentiated and confidence intervals to be constructed in both regression and classification tasks. These conclusions remain true even in early stages of running processes. Moreover, the deployed techniques are fast and produce more accurate predictions. The learned uncertainty could increase users' confidence in their process prediction systems, promote better cooperation between humans and these systems, and enable earlier implementations with smaller datasets.

**Abstract:** Randomization is currently a widely used approach in Sim2Real transfer for data-driven learning algorithms in robotics. Still, most Sim2Real studies report results for a specific randomization technique and often on a highly customized robotic system, making it difficult to evaluate different randomization approaches systematically. To address this problem, we define an easy-to-reproduce experimental setup for a robotic reach-and-balance manipulator task, which can serve as a benchmark for comparison. We compare four randomization strategies with three randomized parameters both in simulation and on a real robot. Our results show that more randomization helps in Sim2Real transfer, yet it can also harm the ability of the algorithm to find a good policy in simulation. Fully randomized simulations and fine-tuning show differentiated results and translate better to the real robot than the other approaches tested.

**Abstract:** In contrast to the advances in characterizing the sample complexity for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs), the optimal statistical complexity for solving constrained MDPs (CMDPs) remains unknown. We resolve this question by providing minimax upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity for learning near-optimal policies in a discounted CMDP with access to a generative model (simulator). In particular, we design a model-based algorithm that addresses two settings: (i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to satisfy the constraint. For (i), we prove that our algorithm returns an $Îµ$-optimal policy with probability $1 - Î´$, by making $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A \log(1/Î´)}{(1 - Î³)^3 Îµ^2}\right)$ queries to the generative model, thus matching the sample-complexity for unconstrained MDPs. For (ii), we show that the algorithm's sample complexity is upper-bounded by $\tilde{O} \left(\frac{S A \, \log(1/Î´)}{(1 - Î³)^5 \, Îµ^2 Î¶^2} \right)$ where $Î¶$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the size of the feasible region. Finally, we prove a matching lower-bound for the strict feasibility setting, thus obtaining the first near minimax optimal bounds for discounted CMDPs. Our results show that learning CMDPs is as easy as MDPs when small constraint violations are allowed, but inherently more difficult when we demand zero constraint violation.

**Abstract:** Overall survival (OS) time is one of the most important evaluation indices for gliomas situations. Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans play an important role in the study of glioma prognosis OS time. Several deep learning-based methods are proposed for the OS time prediction on multi-modal MRI problems. However, these methods usually fuse multi-modal information at the beginning or at the end of the deep learning networks and lack the fusion of features from different scales. In addition, the fusion at the end of networks always adapts global with global (eg. fully connected after concatenation of global average pooling output) or local with local (eg. bilinear pooling), which loses the information of local with global. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-modal OS time prediction of brain tumor patients, which contains an improved nonlocal features fusion module introduced on different scales. Our method obtains a relative 8.76% improvement over the current state-of-art method (0.6989 vs. 0.6426 on accuracy). Extensive testing demonstrates that our method could adapt to situations with missing modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/TangWen920812/mmmna-net.

**Abstract:** The ability to understand and generate languages sets human cognition apart from other known life forms'. We study a way of combing two of the most successful routes to meaning of language--statistical language models and symbolic semantics formalisms--in the task of semantic parsing. Building on a transition-based, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parser, AmrEager, we explore the utility of incorporating pretrained context-aware word embeddings--such as BERT and RoBERTa--in the problem of AMR parsing, contributing a new parser we dub as AmrBerger. Experiments find these rich lexical features alone are not particularly helpful in improving the parser's overall performance as measured by the SMATCH score when compared to the non-contextual counterpart, while additional concept information empowers the system to outperform the baselines. Through lesion study, we found the use of contextual embeddings helps to make the system more robust against the removal of explicit syntactical features. These findings expose the strength and weakness of the contextual embeddings and the language models in the current form, and motivate deeper understanding thereof.

**Abstract:** In many applications, signal denoising is often the first pre-processing step before any subsequent analysis or learning task. In this paper, we propose to apply a deep learning denoising model inspired by a signal processing, a learnable version of wavelet packet transform. The proposed algorithm has signficant learning capabilities with few interpretable parameters and has an intuitive initialisation. We propose a post-learning modification of the parameters to adapt the denoising to different noise levels. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology on two case studies and compare it to other state of the art approaches, including wavelet schrinkage denoising, convolutional neural network, autoencoder and U-net deep models. The first case study is based on designed functions that have typically been used to study denoising properties of the algorithms. The second case study is an audio background removal task. We demonstrate how the proposed algorithm relates to the universality of signal processing methods and the learning capabilities of deep learning approaches. In particular, we evaluate the obtained denoising performances on structured noisy signals inside and outside the classes used for training. In addition to having good performance in denoising signals inside and outside to the training class, our method shows to be particularly robust when different noise levels, noise types and artifacts are added.

**Abstract:** In this work, we aim to tackle the problem of autonomous grading, where a dozer is required to flatten an uneven area. In addition, we explore methods for bridging the gap between a simulated environment and real scenarios. We design both a realistic physical simulation and a scaled real prototype environment mimicking the real dozer dynamics and sensory information. We establish heuristics and learning strategies in order to solve the problem. Through extensive experimentation, we show that although heuristics are capable of tackling the problem in a clean and noise-free simulated environment, they fail catastrophically when facing real world scenarios. As the heuristics are capable of successfully solving the task in the simulated environment, we show they can be leveraged to guide a learning agent which can generalize and solve the task both in simulation and in a scaled prototype environment.

**Abstract:** The rank of neural networks measures information flowing across layers. It is an instance of a key structural condition that applies across broad domains of machine learning. In particular, the assumption of low-rank feature representations leads to algorithmic developments in many architectures. For neural networks, however, the intrinsic mechanism that yields low-rank structures remains vague and unclear. To fill this gap, we perform a rigorous study on the behavior of network rank, focusing particularly on the notion of rank deficiency. We theoretically establish a universal monotonic decreasing property of network rank from the basic rules of differential and algebraic composition, and uncover rank deficiency of network blocks and deep function coupling. By virtue of our numerical tools, we provide the first empirical analysis of the per-layer behavior of network rank in practical settings, i.e., ResNets, deep MLPs, and Transformers on ImageNet. These empirical results are in direct accord with our theory. Furthermore, we reveal a novel phenomenon of independence deficit caused by the rank deficiency of deep networks, where classification confidence of a given category can be linearly decided by the confidence of a handful of other categories. The theoretical results of this work, together with the empirical findings, may advance understanding of the inherent principles of deep neural networks.

**Abstract:** Automated segmentation of tuberculosis (TB)-consistent lesions in chest X-rays (CXRs) using deep learning (DL) methods can help reduce radiologist effort, supplement clinical decision-making, and potentially result in improved patient treatment. The majority of works in the literature discuss training automatic segmentation models using coarse bounding box annotations. However, the granularity of the bounding box annotation could result in the inclusion of a considerable fraction of false positives and negatives at the pixel level that may adversely impact overall semantic segmentation performance. This study (i) evaluates the benefits of using fine-grained annotations of TB-consistent lesions and (ii) trains and constructs ensembles of the variants of U-Net models for semantically segmenting TB-consistent lesions in both original and bone-suppressed frontal CXRs. We evaluated segmentation performance using several ensemble methods such as bitwise AND, bitwise-OR, bitwise-MAX, and stacking. We observed that the stacking ensemble demonstrated superior segmentation performance (Dice score: 0.5743, 95% confidence interval: (0.4055,0.7431)) compared to the individual constituent models and other ensemble methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply ensemble learning to improve fine-grained TB-consistent lesion segmentation performance.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of policy transfer between two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We introduce a lemma based on existing theoretical results in reinforcement learning (RL) to measure the relativity between two arbitrary MDPs, that is the difference between any two cumulative expected returns defined on different policies and environment dynamics. Based on this lemma, we propose two new algorithms referred to as Relative Policy Optimization (RPO) and Relative Transition Optimization (RTO), which can offer fast policy transfer and dynamics modeling, respectively. RPO updates the policy using the relative policy gradient to transfer the policy evaluated in one environment to maximize the return in another, while RTO updates the parameterized dynamics model (if there exists) using the relative transition gradient to reduce the gap between the dynamics of the two environments. Then, integrating the two algorithms offers the complete algorithm Relative Policy-Transition Optimization (RPTO), in which the policy interacts with the two environments simultaneously, such that data collections from two environments, policy and transition updates are completed in one closed loop to form a principled learning framework for policy transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RPTO in OpenAI gym's classic control tasks by creating policy transfer problems via variant dynamics.

**Abstract:** Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is an inference algorithm for state space models that approximates the posterior by sampling from a sequence of intermediate target distributions. The target distributions are often chosen to be the filtering distributions, but these ignore information from future observations, leading to practical and theoretical limitations in inference and model learning. We introduce SIXO, a method that instead learns targets that approximate the smoothing distributions, incorporating information from all observations. The key idea is to use density ratio estimation to fit functions that warp the filtering distributions into the smoothing distributions. We then use SMC with these learned targets to define a variational objective for model and proposal learning. SIXO yields provably tighter log marginal lower bounds and offers significantly more accurate posterior inferences and parameter estimates in a variety of domains.

**Abstract:** Neural networks require a large amount of annotated data to learn. Meta-learning algorithms propose a way to decrease the number of training samples to only a few. One of the most prominent optimization-based meta-learning algorithms is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). However, the key procedure of adaptation to new tasks in MAML is quite slow. In this work we propose an improvement to MAML meta-learning algorithm. We introduce Lambda patterns by which we restrict which weight are updated in the network during the adaptation phase. This makes it possible to skip certain gradient computations. The fastest pattern is selected given an allowed quality degradation threshold parameter. In certain cases, quality improvement is possible by a careful pattern selection. The experiments conducted have shown that via Lambda adaptation pattern selection, it is possible to significantly improve the MAML method in the following areas: adaptation time has been decreased by a factor of 3 with minimal accuracy loss; accuracy for one-step adaptation has been substantially improved.

**Abstract:** Sequential recommendation requires the recommender to capture the evolving behavior characteristics from logged user behavior data for accurate recommendations. However, user behavior sequences are viewed as a script with multiple ongoing threads intertwined. We find that only a small set of pivotal behaviors can be evolved into the user's future action. As a result, the future behavior of the user is hard to predict. We conclude this characteristic for sequential behaviors of each user as the Behavior Pathway. Different users have their unique behavior pathways. Among existing sequential models, transformers have shown great capacity in capturing global-dependent characteristics. However, these models mainly provide a dense distribution over all previous behaviors using the self-attention mechanism, making the final predictions overwhelmed by the trivial behaviors not adjusted to each user. In this paper, we build the Recommender Transformer (RETR) with a novel Pathway Attention mechanism. RETR can dynamically plan the behavior pathway specified for each user, and sparingly activate the network through this behavior pathway to effectively capture evolving patterns useful for recommendation. The key design is a learned binary route to prevent the behavior pathway from being overwhelmed by trivial behaviors. We empirically verify the effectiveness of RETR on seven real-world datasets and RETR yields state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Improving the quality of search results can significantly enhance users experience and engagement with search engines. In spite of several recent advancements in the fields of machine learning and data mining, correctly classifying items for a particular user search query has been a long-standing challenge, which still has a large room for improvement. This paper introduces the "Shopping Queries Dataset", a large dataset of difficult Amazon search queries and results, publicly released with the aim of fostering research in improving the quality of search results. The dataset contains around 130 thousand unique queries and 2.6 million manually labeled (query,product) relevance judgements. The dataset is multilingual with queries in English, Japanese, and Spanish. The Shopping Queries Dataset is being used in one of the KDDCup'22 challenges. In this paper, we describe the dataset and present three evaluation tasks along with baseline results: (i) ranking the results list, (ii) classifying product results into relevance categories, and (iii) identifying substitute products for a given query. We anticipate that this data will become the gold standard for future research in the topic of product search.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes probabilistic conformal prediction (PCP), a predictive inference algorithm that estimates a target variable by a discontinuous predictive set. Given inputs, PCP construct the predictive set based on random samples from an estimated generative model. It is efficient and compatible with either explicit or implicit conditional generative models. Theoretically, we show that PCP guarantees correct marginal coverage with finite samples. Empirically, we study PCP on a variety of simulated and real datasets. Compared to existing methods for conformal inference, PCP provides sharper predictive sets.

**Abstract:** Large-scale Protein Language Models (PLMs) have improved performance in protein prediction tasks, ranging from 3D structure prediction to various function predictions. In particular, AlphaFold, a ground-breaking AI system, could potentially reshape structural biology. However, the utility of the PLM module in AlphaFold, Evoformer, has not been explored beyond structure prediction. In this paper, we investigate the representation ability of three popular PLMs: ESM-1b (single sequence), MSA-Transformer (multiple sequence alignment) and Evoformer (structural), with a special focus on Evoformer. Specifically, we aim to answer the following key questions: (i) Does the Evoformer trained as part of AlphaFold produce representations amenable to predicting protein function? (ii) If yes, can Evoformer replace ESM-1b and MSA-Transformer? (iii) How much do these PLMs rely on evolution-related protein data? In this regard, are they complementary to each other? We compare these models by empirical study along with new insights and conclusions. Finally, we release code and datasets for reproducibility.

**Abstract:** For 3D medical image (e.g. CT and MRI) segmentation, the difficulty of segmenting each slice in a clinical case varies greatly. Previous research on volumetric medical image segmentation in a slice-by-slice manner conventionally use the identical 2D deep neural network to segment all the slices of the same case, ignoring the data heterogeneity among image slices. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation and propose a dynamic architecture network named Med-DANet based on adaptive model selection to achieve effective accuracy and efficiency trade-off. For each slice of the input 3D MRI volume, our proposed method learns a slice-specific decision by the Decision Network to dynamically select a suitable model from the predefined Model Bank for the subsequent 2D segmentation task. Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that our proposed method achieves comparable or better results than previous state-of-the-art methods for 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation with much less model complexity. Compared with the state-of-the-art 3D method TransBTS, the proposed framework improves the model efficiency by up to 3.5x without sacrificing the accuracy. Our code will be publicly available soon.

**Abstract:** Deep-learning based techniques have contributed to the remarkable progress in the field of automatic image quality assessment (IQA). Existing IQA methods are designed to measure the quality of an image in terms of Mean Opinion Score (MOS) at the image-level (i.e. the whole image) or at the patch-level (dividing the image into multiple units and measuring quality of each patch). Some applications may require assessing the quality at the pixel-level (i.e. MOS value for each pixel), however, this is not possible in case of existing techniques as the spatial information is lost owing to their network structures. This paper proposes an IQA algorithm that can measure the MOS at the pixel-level, in addition to the image-level MOS. The proposed algorithm consists of three core parts, namely: i) Local IQA; ii) Region of Interest (ROI) prediction; iii) High-level feature embedding. The Local IQA part outputs the MOS at the pixel-level, or pixel-by-pixel MOS - we term it 'pMOS'. The ROI prediction part outputs weights that characterize the relative importance of region when calculating the image-level IQA. The high-level feature embedding part extracts high-level image features which are then embedded into the Local IQA part. In other words, the proposed algorithm yields three outputs: the pMOS which represents MOS for each pixel, the weights from the ROI indicating the relative importance of region, and finally the image-level MOS that is obtained by the weighted sum of pMOS and ROI values. The image-level MOS thus obtained by utilizing pMOS and ROI weights shows superior performance compared to the existing popular IQA techniques. In addition, visualization results indicate that predicted pMOS and ROI outputs are reasonably aligned with the general principles of the human visual system (HVS).

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of training a deep neural network with nonsmooth regularization to retrieve a sparse and efficient sub-structure. Our regularizer is only assumed to be lower semi-continuous and prox-bounded. We combine an adaptive quadratic regularization approach with proximal stochastic gradient principles to derive a new solver, called SR2, whose convergence and worst-case complexity are established without knowledge or approximation of the gradient's Lipschitz constant. We formulate a stopping criteria that ensures an appropriate first-order stationarity measure converges to zero under certain conditions. We establish a worst-case iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(Îµ^{-2})$ that matches those of related methods like ProxGEN, where the learning rate is assumed to be related to the Lipschitz constant. Our experiments on network instances trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$ regularizations show that SR2 consistently achieves higher sparsity and accuracy than related methods such as ProxGEN and ProxSGD.

**Abstract:** Representation learning of source code is essential for applying machine learning to software engineering tasks. Learning code representation across different programming languages has been shown to be more effective than learning from single-language datasets, since more training data from multi-language datasets improves the model's ability to extract language-agnostic information from source code. However, existing multi-language models overlook the language-specific information which is crucial for downstream tasks that is training on multi-language datasets, while only focusing on learning shared parameters among the different languages. To address this problem, we propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual code representation learning. MetaTPTrans generates different parameters for the feature extractor according to the specific programming language of the input source code snippet, enabling the model to learn both language-agnostics and language-specific information. Experimental results show that MetaTPTrans improves the F1 score of state-of-the-art approaches significantly by up to 2.40 percentage points for code summarization, a language-agnostic task; and the prediction accuracy of Top-1 (Top-5) by up to 7.32 (13.15) percentage points for code completion, a language-specific task.

**Abstract:** Data used in image segmentation are not always defined on the same grid. This is particularly true for medical images, where the resolution, field-of-view and orientation can differ across channels and subjects. Images and labels are therefore commonly resampled onto the same grid, as a pre-processing step. However, the resampling operation introduces partial volume effects and blurring, thereby changing the effective resolution and reducing the contrast between structures. In this paper we propose a splat layer, which automatically handles resolution mismatches in the input data. This layer pushes each image onto a mean space where the forward pass is performed. As the splat operator is the adjoint to the resampling operator, the mean-space prediction can be pulled back to the native label space, where the loss function is computed. Thus, the need for explicit resolution adjustment using interpolation is removed. We show on two publicly available datasets, with simulated and real multi-modal magnetic resonance images, that this model improves segmentation results compared to resampling as a pre-processing step.

**Abstract:** Smart manufacturing systems are being deployed at a growing rate because of their ability to interpret a wide variety of sensed information and act on the knowledge gleaned from system observations. In many cases, the principal goal of the smart manufacturing system is to rapidly detect (or anticipate) failures to reduce operational cost and eliminate downtime. This often boils down to detecting anomalies within the sensor date acquired from the system. The smart manufacturing application domain poses certain salient technical challenges. In particular, there are often multiple types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines, such as, the RPM of the motor. The anomaly detection process therefore has to be calibrated near an operating point. In this paper, we analyze four datasets from sensors deployed from manufacturing testbeds. We evaluate the performance of several traditional and ML-based forecasting models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then, considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer learning from a high data rate sensor to perform defect type classification. Taken together, we show that predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way for predictive maintenance.

**Abstract:** We are interested in unsupervised structure learning with a particular focus on directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models. Compute required to infer these structures is typically super-exponential in the amount of variables, as inference requires a sweep of a combinatorially large space of potential structures. That is, until recent advances allowed to search this space using a differentiable metric, drastically reducing search time. While this technique -- named NOTEARS -- is widely considered a seminal work in DAG-discovery, it concedes an important property in favour of differentiability: transportability. In our paper we introduce D-Struct which recovers transportability in the found structures through a novel architecture and loss function, while remaining completely differentiable. As D-Struct remains differentiable, one can easily adopt our method in differentiable architectures as was previously done with NOTEARS. In our experiments we empirically validate D-Struct with respect to edge accuracy and the structural Hamming distance.

**Abstract:** This paper aims to advance the mathematical intelligence of machines by presenting the first Chinese mathematical pre-trained language model~(PLM) for effectively understanding and representing mathematical problems. Unlike other standard NLP tasks, mathematical texts are difficult to understand, since they involve mathematical terminology, symbols and formulas in the problem statement. Typically, it requires complex mathematical logic and background knowledge for solving mathematical problems.
  Considering the complex nature of mathematical texts, we design a novel curriculum pre-training approach for improving the learning of mathematical PLMs, consisting of both basic and advanced courses. Specially, we first perform token-level pre-training based on a position-biased masking strategy, and then design logic-based pre-training tasks that aim to recover the shuffled sentences and formulas, respectively. Finally, we introduce a more difficult pre-training task that enforces the PLM to detect and correct the errors in its generated solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on offline evaluation (including nine math-related tasks) and online $A/B$ test. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with a number of competitive baselines. Our code is available at: \textcolor{blue}{\url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/JiuZhang}}.

**Abstract:** Conventionally, the radiologist prepares the diagnosis notes and shares them with the transcriptionist. Then the transcriptionist prepares a preliminary formatted report referring to the notes, and finally, the radiologist reviews the report, corrects the errors, and signs off. This workflow causes significant delays and errors in the report. In current research work, we focus on applications of NLP techniques like Information Extraction (IE) and domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) to automatically generate radiology reports from radiologist's dictation. This paper focuses on KG construction for each organ by extracting information from an existing large corpus of free-text radiology reports. We develop an information extraction pipeline that combines rule-based, pattern-based, and dictionary-based techniques with lexical-semantic features to extract entities and relations. Missing information in short dictation can be accessed from the KGs to generate pathological descriptions and hence the radiology report. Generated pathological descriptions evaluated using semantic similarity metrics, which shows 97% similarity with gold standard pathological descriptions. Also, our analysis shows that our IE module is performing better than the OpenIE tool for the radiology domain. Furthermore, we include a manual qualitative analysis from radiologists, which shows that 80-85% of the generated reports are correctly written, and the remaining are partially correct.

**Abstract:** This paper describes new techniques for learning atlas-like representations of 3D surfaces, i.e. homeomorphic transformations from a 2D domain to surfaces. Compared to prior work, we propose two major contributions. First, instead of mapping a fixed 2D domain, such as a set of square patches, to the surface, we learn a continuous 2D domain with arbitrary topology by optimizing a point sampling distribution represented as a mixture of Gaussians. Second, we learn consistent mappings in both directions: charts, from the 3D surface to 2D domain, and parametrizations, their inverse. We demonstrate that this improves the quality of the learned surface representation, as well as its consistency in a collection of related shapes. It thus leads to improvements for applications such as correspondence estimation, texture transfer, and consistent UV mapping. As an additional technical contribution, we outline that, while incorporating normal consistency has clear benefits, it leads to issues in the optimization, and that these issues can be mitigated using a simple repulsive regularization. We demonstrate that our contributions provide better surface representation than existing baselines.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims at learning a machine learning model using a labeled source domain that performs well on a similar yet different, unlabeled target domain. UDA is important in many applications such as medicine, where it is used to adapt risk scores across different patient cohorts. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for UDA of time series data, called CLUDA. Specifically, we propose a contrastive learning framework to learn domain-invariant semantics in multivariate time series, so that these preserve label information for the prediction task. In our framework, we further capture semantic variation between source and target domain via nearest-neighbor contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first framework to learn domain-invariant semantic information for UDA of time series data. We evaluate our framework using large-scale, real-world datasets with medical time series (i.e., MIMIC-IV and AmsterdamUMCdb) to demonstrate its effectiveness and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance for time series UDA.

As an extension from our previous work where we trained a customized convolutional neural network on a public cohort with 201 patients and the cropped 2D patches around the region of interest were used as the input, the cropped 2.5D slices of the prostate glands were used as the input, and the optimal model were searched in the model space using autoKeras. Something different was peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG) were trained and tested separately, the PZ detector and CG detector were demonstrated effectively in highlighting the most suspicious slices out of a sequence, hopefully to greatly ease the workload for the physicians.

**Abstract:** A wide range of models have been proposed for Graph Generative Models, necessitating effective methods to evaluate their quality. So far, most techniques use either traditional metrics based on subgraph counting, or the representations of randomly initialized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We propose using representations from contrastively trained GNNs, rather than random GNNs, and show this gives more reliable evaluation metrics. Neither traditional approaches nor GNN-based approaches dominate the other, however: we give examples of graphs that each approach is unable to distinguish. We demonstrate that Graph Substructure Networks (GSNs), which in a way combine both approaches, are better at distinguishing the distances between graph datasets.

**Abstract:** Score-based generative modeling (SGM) is a highly successful approach for learning a probability distribution from data and generating further samples. We prove the first polynomial convergence guarantees for the core mechanic behind SGM: drawing samples from a probability density $p$ given a score estimate (an estimate of $\nabla \ln p$) that is accurate in $L^2(p)$. Compared to previous works, we do not incur error that grows exponentially in time or that suffers from a curse of dimensionality. Our guarantee works for any smooth distribution and depends polynomially on its log-Sobolev constant. Using our guarantee, we give a theoretical analysis of score-based generative modeling, which transforms white-noise input into samples from a learned data distribution given score estimates at different noise scales. Our analysis gives theoretical grounding to the observation that an annealed procedure is required in practice to generate good samples, as our proof depends essentially on using annealing to obtain a warm start at each step. Moreover, we show that a predictor-corrector algorithm gives better convergence than using either portion alone.

**Abstract:** Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL), composed of few lenses, has great potential in panoramic surrounding sensing tasks for mobile and wearable devices because of its tiny size and large Field of View (FoV). However, the image quality of tiny-volume PAL confines to optical limit due to the lack of lenses for aberration correction. In this paper, we propose an Annular Computational Imaging (ACI) framework to break the optical limit of light-weight PAL design. To facilitate learning-based image restoration, we introduce a wave-based simulation pipeline for panoramic imaging and tackle the synthetic-to-real gap through multiple data distributions. The proposed pipeline can be easily adapted to any PAL with design parameters and is suitable for loose-tolerance designs. Furthermore, we design the Physics Informed Image Restoration Network (PI2RNet), considering the physical priors of panoramic imaging and physics-informed learning. At the dataset level, we create the DIVPano dataset and the extensive experiments on it illustrate that our proposed network sets the new state of the art in the panoramic image restoration under spatially-variant degradation. In addition, the evaluation of the proposed ACI on a simple PAL with only 3 spherical lenses reveals the delicate balance between high-quality panoramic imaging and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore Computational Imaging (CI) in PAL. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/ACI-PI2RNet.

**Abstract:** Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo ground-based interferometers are poised to probe an unprecedentedly large volume of space, enhancing the discovery power of the observations to even new sources of gravitational wave emitters. In this scenario, the development of highly optimized gravitational wave detection algorithms is crucial. We propose a novel layered framework for real-time detection of gravitational waves inspired by speech processing techniques and, in the present implementation, based on a state-of-the-art machine learning approach involving a hybridization of genetic programming and neural networks. The key aspects of the newly proposed framework are: the well structured, layered approach, and the low computational complexity. The paper describes the basic concepts of the framework and the derivation of the first three layers. Even if, in the present implementation, the layers are based on models derived using a machine learning approach, the proposed layered structure has a universal nature. To train and test the models, we used simulated binary black hole gravitational wave waveforms in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity design. Compared to more complex approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, our framework, even using the simple ground model described in the paper, has similar performance but with a much lower computational complexity and a higher degree of modularity. Furthermore, the underlying exploitation of short-term features makes the results of the new framework virtually independent against time-position of gravitational wave signals, simplifying its future exploitation in real-time multi-layer pipelines for gravitational-wave detection with second generation interferometers.

**Abstract:** The human brain can be considered to be a graphical structure comprising of tens of billions of biological neurons connected by synapses. It has the remarkable ability to automatically re-route information flow through alternate paths in case some neurons are damaged. Moreover, the brain is capable of retaining information and applying it to similar but completely unseen scenarios. In this paper, we take inspiration from these attributes of the brain, to develop a computational framework to find the optimal low cost path between a source node and a destination node in a generalized graph. We show that our framework is capable of handling unseen graphs at test time. Moreover, it can find alternate optimal paths, when nodes are arbitrarily added or removed during inference, while maintaining a fixed prediction time.

**Abstract:** In order to develop effective sequential recommenders, a series of sequence representation learning (SRL) methods are proposed to model historical user behaviors. Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated description text of items to learn transferable representations across different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed universal SRL method. The code and pre-trained model are available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UniSRec.

We show that the former only need $\mathcal{M}$ sampled functional values in order to achieve a uniform approximation error of $O_{d}(2^{-\mathcal{M}^{1/d}})$ and that this error rate is optimal, in the sense that, NNs might achieve worse.

**Abstract:** The problem of Raman amplifier optimization is studied. A differentiable interpolation function is obtained for the Raman gain coefficient using machine learning (ML), which allows for the gradient descent optimization of forward-propagating Raman pumps. Both the frequency and power of an arbitrary number of pumps in a forward pumping configuration are then optimized for an arbitrary data channel load and span length. The forward propagation model is combined with an experimentally-trained ML model of a backward-pumping Raman amplifier to jointly optimize the frequency and power of the forward amplifier's pumps and the powers of the backward amplifier's pumps. The joint forward and backward amplifier optimization is demonstrated for an unrepeatered transmission of 250 km. A gain flatness of $<$ 1~dB over 4 THz is achieved. The optimized amplifiers are validated using a numerical simulator.

**Abstract:** While previously thought to be uniquely human, cumulative cultural evolution continues to be found in non-human animals. It occurs when an adaptive innovation from an individual is repeatedly passed onto consecutive generations through social learning. For example, pigeons who fly alone or in stable pairs show relatively rigid sub-optimal routes, but gradually improve route efficiency over generations of pairs in which experienced members are swapped for naive ones. This raises the question of what the minimally required cognitive architecture is for cumulative cultural evolution to emerge. Here, I aimed to answer this question in artificial agents who employ three main functions: goal-direction, social proximity, and route memory. At the optima for efficiency and generational efficiency improvement, agents replicated cumulative culture observed in pigeons. At each optimum, paths were determined primarily by memory, and to a lesser extent by social proximity and goal-direction. Because of their need for social proximity, each naive agent stayed close to their experienced counterpart as that followed its memorised path. However, unhindered by route memory, the naive agent's heading was more likely to err towards the goal. This subtly biased pairs' routes, and the resulting efficiency improvement is thus regression to the goal. The resulting incremental improvements over generations meet all core criteria in current frameworks of cumulative cultural evolution, suggesting that rudimentary cumulative optimisation is an evolutionary mechanism that emerges even in simple systems that prefer social proximity and have a memory capacity.

**Abstract:** The purpose of this project was to collect and analyse data about the comparability and real-life applicability of published results focusing on Microsoft Windows malware, more specifically the impact of dataset size and testing dataset imbalance on measured detector performance. Some researchers use smaller datasets, and if dataset size has a significant impact on performance, that makes comparison of the published results difficult. Researchers also tend to use balanced datasets and accuracy as a metric for testing. The former is not a true representation of reality, where benign samples significantly outnumber malware, and the latter is approach is known to be problematic for imbalanced problems. The project identified two key objectives, to understand if dataset size correlates to measured detector performance to an extent that prevents meaningful comparison of published results, and to understand if good performance reported in published research can be expected to perform well in a real-world deployment scenario. The research's results suggested that dataset size does correlate with measured detector performance to an extent that prevents meaningful comparison of published results, and without understanding the nature of the training set size-accuracy curve for published results conclusions between approaches on which approach is "better" shouldn't be made solely based on accuracy scores. Results also suggested that high accuracy scores don't necessarily translate to high real-world performance.

**Abstract:** The scalability of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is hindered by the sequential dependence of each time step's computation on the previous time step's output. Therefore, one way to speed up and scale RNNs is to reduce the computation required at each time step independent of model size and task. In this paper, we propose a model that reformulates Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) as an event-based activity-sparse model that we call the Event-based GRU (EGRU), where units compute updates only on receipt of input events (event-based) from other units. When combined with having only a small fraction of the units active at a time (activity-sparse), this model has the potential to be vastly more compute efficient than current RNNs. Notably, activity-sparsity in our model also translates into sparse parameter updates during gradient descent, extending this compute efficiency to the training phase. We show that the EGRU demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling while maintaining high activity sparsity naturally during inference and training. This sets the stage for the next generation of recurrent networks that are scalable and more suitable for novel neuromorphic hardware.

**Abstract:** Reducing energy consumption is a pressing issue in low-power machine-type communication (MTC) networks. In this regard, the Wake-up Signal (WuS) technology, which aims to minimize the energy consumed by the radio interface of the machine-type devices (MTDs), stands as a promising solution. However, state-of-the-art WuS mechanisms use static operational parameters, so they cannot efficiently adapt to the system dynamics. To overcome this, we design a simple but efficient neural network to predict MTC traffic patterns and configure WuS accordingly. Our proposed forecasting WuS (FWuS) leverages an accurate long-short term memory (LSTM)- based traffic prediction that allows extending the sleep time of MTDs by avoiding frequent page monitoring occasions in idle state. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our approach. The traffic prediction errors are shown to be below 4%, being false alarm and miss-detection probabilities respectively below 8.8% and 1.3%. In terms of energy consumption reduction, FWuS can outperform the best benchmark mechanism in up to 32%. Finally, we certify the ability of FWuS to dynamically adapt to traffic density changes, promoting low-power MTC scalability

**Abstract:** Neuromorphic computing is an emerging computing paradigm that moves away from batched processing towards the online, event-driven, processing of streaming data. Neuromorphic chips, when coupled with spike-based sensors, can inherently adapt to the "semantics" of the data distribution by consuming energy only when relevant events are recorded in the timing of spikes and by proving a low-latency response to changing conditions in the environment. This paper proposes an end-to-end design for a neuromorphic wireless Internet-of-Things system that integrates spike-based sensing, processing, and communication. In the proposed NeuroComm system, each sensing device is equipped with a neuromorphic sensor, a spiking neural network (SNN), and an impulse radio transmitter with multiple antennas. Transmission takes place over a shared fading channel to a receiver equipped with a multi-antenna impulse radio receiver and with an SNN. In order to enable adaptation of the receiver to the fading channel conditions, we introduce a hypernetwork to control the weights of the decoding SNN using pilots. Pilots, encoding SNNs, decoding SNN, and hypernetwork are jointly trained across multiple channel realizations. The proposed system is shown to significantly improve over conventional frame-based digital solutions, as well as over alternative non-adaptive training methods, in terms of time-to-accuracy and energy consumption metrics.

**Abstract:** We examine the problem of regret minimization when the learner is involved in a continuous game with other optimizing agents: in this case, if all players follow a no-regret algorithm, it is possible to achieve significantly lower regret relative to fully adversarial environments. We study this problem in the context of variationally stable games (a class of continuous games which includes all convex-concave and monotone games), and when the players only have access to noisy estimates of their individual payoff gradients. If the noise is additive, the game-theoretic and purely adversarial settings enjoy similar regret guarantees; however, if the noise is multiplicative, we show that the learners can, in fact, achieve constant regret. We achieve this faster rate via an optimistic gradient scheme with learning rate separation -- that is, the method's extrapolation and update steps are tuned to different schedules, depending on the noise profile. Subsequently, to eliminate the need for delicate hyperparameter tuning, we propose a fully adaptive method that smoothly interpolates between worst- and best-case regret guarantees.

**Abstract:** Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is an interesting technology that enables massive connectivity as required in future 5G and 6G networks. While purely linear processing already achieves good performance in NOMA systems, in certain scenarios, non-linear processing is mandatory to ensure acceptable performance. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that combines the advantages of both linear and non-linear processing. Its real-time detection performance is demonstrated by a highly efficient implementation on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Using real measurements in a laboratory environment, we show the superiority of our approach over conventional methods.

**Abstract:** Gradient-based optimization methods for hyperparameter tuning guarantee theoretical convergence to stationary solutions when for fixed upper-level variable values, the lower level of the bilevel program is strongly convex (LLSC) and smooth (LLS). This condition is not satisfied for bilevel programs arising from tuning hyperparameters in many machine learning algorithms. In this work, we develop a sequentially convergent Value Function based Difference-of-Convex Algorithm with inexactness (VF-iDCA). We show that this algorithm achieves stationary solutions without LLSC and LLS assumptions for bilevel programs from a broad class of hyperparameter tuning applications. Our extensive experiments confirm our theoretical findings and show that the proposed VF-iDCA yields superior performance when applied to tune hyperparameters.

**Abstract:** Background: Fluorescence angiography has shown very promising results in reducing anastomotic leaks by allowing the surgeon to select optimally perfused tissue. However, subjective interpretation of the fluorescent signal still hinders broad application of the technique, as significant variation between different surgeons exists. Our aim is to develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to classify colonic tissue as 'perfused' or 'not perfused' based on intraoperative fluorescence angiography data.
  Methods: A classification model with a Resnet architecture was trained on a dataset of fluorescence angiography videos of colorectal resections at a tertiary referral centre. Frames corresponding to fluorescent and non-fluorescent segments of colon were used to train a classification algorithm. Validation using frames from patients not used in the training set was performed, including both data collected using the same equipment and data collected using a different camera. Performance metrics were calculated, and saliency maps used to further analyse the output. A decision boundary was identified based on the tissue classification.
  Results: A convolutional neural network was successfully trained on 1790 frames from 7 patients and validated in 24 frames from 14 patients. The accuracy on the training set was 100%, on the validation set was 80%. Recall and precision were respectively 100% and 100% on the training set and 68.8% and 91.7% on the validation set.
  Conclusion: Automated classification of intraoperative fluorescence angiography with a high degree of accuracy is possible and allows automated decision boundary identification. This will enable surgeons to standardise the technique of fluorescence angiography. A web based app was made available to deploy the algorithm.
