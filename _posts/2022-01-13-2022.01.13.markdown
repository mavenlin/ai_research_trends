**Abstract:** Neuroevolution has recently been shown to be quite competitive in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, and is able to alleviate some of the drawbacks of gradient-based approaches. This paper will focus on applying neuroevolution using a simple genetic algorithm (GA) to find the weights of a neural network that produce optimally behaving agents. In addition, we present two novel modifications that improve the data efficiency and speed of convergence when compared to the initial implementation. The modifications are evaluated on the FrozenLake environment provided by OpenAI gym and prove to be significantly better than the baseline approach.

**Abstract:** The architecture and the parameters of neural networks are often optimized independently, which requires costly retraining of the parameters whenever the architecture is modified. In this work we instead focus on growing the architecture without requiring costly retraining. We present a method that adds new neurons during training without impacting what is already learned, while improving the training dynamics. We achieve the latter by maximizing the gradients of the new weights and find the optimal initialization efficiently by means of the singular value decomposition (SVD). We call this technique Gradient Maximizing Growth (GradMax) and demonstrate its effectiveness in variety of vision tasks and architectures.

**Abstract:** Despite recent progress made by self-supervised methods in representation learning with residual networks, they still underperform supervised learning on the ImageNet classification benchmark, limiting their applicability in performance-critical settings. Building on prior theoretical insights from Mitrovic et al., 2021, we propose ReLICv2 which combines an explicit invariance loss with a contrastive objective over a varied set of appropriately constructed data views. ReLICv2 achieves 77.1% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using linear evaluation with a ResNet50 architecture and 80.6% with larger ResNet models, outperforming previous state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches by a wide margin. Most notably, ReLICv2 is the first representation learning method to consistently outperform the supervised baseline in a like-for-like comparison using a range of standard ResNet architectures. Finally we show that despite using ResNet encoders, ReLICv2 is comparable to state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformers.

**Abstract:** Vision-language (V+L) pretraining models have achieved great success in supporting multimedia applications by understanding the alignments between images and text. While existing vision-language pretraining models primarily focus on understanding objects in images or entities in text, they often ignore the alignment at the level of events and their argument structures. % In this work, we propose a contrastive learning framework to enforce vision-language pretraining models to comprehend events and associated argument (participant) roles. To achieve this, we take advantage of text information extraction technologies to obtain event structural knowledge, and utilize multiple prompt functions to contrast difficult negative descriptions by manipulating event structures. We also design an event graph alignment loss based on optimal transport to capture event argument structures. In addition, we collect a large event-rich dataset (106,875 images) for pretraining, which provides a more challenging image retrieval benchmark to assess the understanding of complicated lengthy sentences. Experiments show that our zero-shot CLIP-Event outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model in argument extraction on Multimedia Event Extraction, achieving more than 5\% absolute F-score gain in event extraction, as well as significant improvements on a variety of downstream tasks under zero-shot settings.

**Abstract:** We present SeamlessGAN, a method capable of automatically generating tileable texture maps from a single input exemplar. In contrast to most existing methods, focused solely on solving the synthesis problem, our work tackles both problems, synthesis and tileability, simultaneously. Our key idea is to realize that tiling a latent space within a generative network trained using adversarial expansion techniques produces outputs with continuity at the seam intersection that can be then be turned into tileable images by cropping the central area. Since not every value of the latent space is valid to produce high-quality outputs, we leverage the discriminator as a perceptual error metric capable of identifying artifact-free textures during a sampling process. Further, in contrast to previous work on deep texture synthesis, our model is designed and optimized to work with multi-layered texture representations, enabling textures composed of multiple maps such as albedo, normals, etc. We extensively test our design choices for the network architecture, loss function and sampling parameters. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that our approach outperforms previous methods and works for textures of different types.

**Abstract:** It is commonly acknowledged that the availability of the huge amount of (training) data is one of the most important factors for many recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, datasets are often designed for specific tasks in narrow AI sub areas and there is no unified way to manage and access them. This not only creates unnecessary overheads when training or deploying Machine Learning models but also limits the understanding of the data, which is very important for data-centric AI. In this paper, we present our vision about a unified framework for different datasets so that they can be integrated and queried easily, e.g., using standard query languages. We demonstrate this in our ongoing work to create a framework for datasets in Computer Vision and show its advantages in different scenarios. Our demonstration is available at https://vision.semkg.org.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between two significantly disparate domains to learn high-level semantic alignment is a crucial yet challenging task.~To this end, in this work, we propose exploiting low-level edge information to facilitate the adaptation as a precursor task, which has a small cross-domain gap, compared with semantic segmentation.~The precise contour then provides spatial information to guide the semantic adaptation. More specifically, we propose a multi-task framework to learn a contouring adaptation network along with a semantic segmentation adaptation network, which takes both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice and its initial edge map as input.~These two networks are jointly trained with source domain labels, and the feature and edge map level adversarial learning is carried out for cross-domain alignment. In addition, self-entropy minimization is incorporated to further enhance segmentation performance. We evaluated our framework on the BraTS2018 database for cross-modality segmentation of brain tumors, showing the validity and superiority of our approach, compared with competing methods.

**Abstract:** Characterizing the patterns of errors that a system makes helps researchers focus future development on increasing its accuracy and robustness. We propose a novel form of "meta learning" that automatically learns interpretable rules that characterize the types of errors that a system makes, and demonstrate these rules' ability to help understand and improve two NLP systems. Our approach works by collecting error cases on validation data, extracting meta-features describing these samples, and finally learning rules that characterize errors using these features. We apply our approach to VilBERT, for Visual Question Answering, and RoBERTa, for Common Sense Question Answering. Our system learns interpretable rules that provide insights into systemic errors these systems make on the given tasks. Using these insights, we are also able to "close the loop" and modestly improve performance of these systems.

**Abstract:** The challenging field of scene text detection requires complex data annotation, which is time-consuming and expensive. Techniques, such as weak supervision, can reduce the amount of data needed. In this paper we propose a weak supervision method for scene text detection, which makes use of reinforcement learning (RL). The reward received by the RL agent is estimated by a neural network, instead of being inferred from ground-truth labels. First, we enhance an existing supervised RL approach to text detection with several training optimizations, allowing us to close the performance gap to regression-based algorithms. We then use our proposed system in a weakly- and semi-supervised training on real-world data. Our results show that training in a weakly supervised setting is feasible. However, we find that using our model in a semi-supervised setting , e.g. when combining labeled synthetic data with unannotated real-world data, produces the best results.

**Abstract:** Artificial neural networks for simulated motor control and robotics often adopt generic architectures like fully connected MLPs. While general, these tabula rasa architectures rely on large amounts of experience to learn, are not easily transferable to new bodies, and have internal dynamics that are difficult to interpret. In nature, animals are born with highly structured connectivity in their nervous systems shaped by evolution; this innate circuitry acts synergistically with learning mechanisms to provide inductive biases that enable most animals to function well soon after birth and improve abilities efficiently. Convolutional networks inspired by visual circuitry have encoded useful biases for vision. However, it is unknown the extent to which ANN architectures inspired by neural circuitry can yield useful biases for other domains. In this work, we ask what advantages biologically inspired network architecture can provide in the context of motor control. Specifically, we translate C. elegans circuits for locomotion into an ANN model controlling a simulated Swimmer agent. On a locomotion task, our architecture achieves good initial performance and asymptotic performance comparable with MLPs, while dramatically improving data efficiency and requiring orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture is more interpretable and transfers to new body designs. An ablation analysis shows that principled excitation/inhibition is crucial for learning, while weight initialization contributes to good initial performance. Our work demonstrates several advantages of ANN architectures inspired by systems neuroscience and suggests a path towards modeling more complex behavior.

**Abstract:** Since sparse neural networks usually contain many zero weights, these unnecessary network connections can potentially be eliminated without degrading network performance. Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the potential to significantly reduce FLOPs and computational resources. In this work, we propose a new automatic pruning method - Sparse Connectivity Learning (SCL). Specifically, a weight is re-parameterized as an element-wise multiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network connectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a unit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a straight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that the proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables converge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and Identity STEs can satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt Identity STE in SCL for discrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are very unbalanced, hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature to optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse masks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization term in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or hyper-parameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is explored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity for the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic pruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically learn and select important network connections for various baseline network structures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the SOTA human-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs reduction.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate several existing and a new state-of-the-art generative adversarial network-based (GAN) voice conversion method for enhancing dysarthric speech for improved dysarthric speech recognition. We compare key components of existing methods as part of a rigorous ablation study to find the most effective solution to improve dysarthric speech recognition. We find that straightforward signal processing methods such as stationary noise removal and vocoder-based time stretching lead to dysarthric speech recognition results comparable to those obtained when using state-of-the-art GAN-based voice conversion methods as measured using a phoneme recognition task. Additionally, our proposed solution of a combination of MaskCycleGAN-VC and time stretched enhancement is able to improve the phoneme recognition results for certain dysarthric speakers compared to our time stretched baseline.

**Abstract:** Class imbalance occurs in many real-world applications, including image classification, where the number of images in each class differs significantly. With imbalanced data, the generative adversarial networks (GANs) leans to majority class samples. The two recent methods, Balancing GAN (BAGAN) and improved BAGAN (BAGAN-GP), are proposed as an augmentation tool to handle this problem and restore the balance to the data. The former pre-trains the autoencoder weights in an unsupervised manner. However, it is unstable when the images from different categories have similar features. The latter is improved based on BAGAN by facilitating supervised autoencoder training, but the pre-training is biased towards the majority classes. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Balanced Pre-training for Generative Adversarial Networks (CAPGAN) as an augmentation tool to generate realistic synthetic images. In particular, we utilize a conditional convolutional variational autoencoder with supervised and balanced pre-training for the GAN initialization and training with gradient penalty. Our proposed method presents a superior performance of other state-of-the-art methods on the highly imbalanced version of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and two medical imaging datasets. Our method can synthesize high-quality minority samples in terms of FrÃ©chet inception distance, structural similarity index measure and perceptual quality.

**Abstract:** Quantum machine learning is a fast emerging field that aims to tackle machine learning using quantum algorithms and quantum computing. Due to the lack of physical qubits and an effective means to map real-world data from Euclidean space to Hilbert space, most of these methods focus on quantum analogies or process simulations rather than devising concrete architectures based on qubits. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for graph-structured data, which we refer to as the Decompositional Quantum Graph Neural Network (DQGNN). DQGNN implements the GNN theoretical framework using the tensor product and unity matrices representation, which greatly reduces the number of model parameters required. When controlled by a classical computer, DQGNN can accommodate arbitrarily sized graphs by processing substructures from the input graph using a modestly-sized quantum device. The architecture is based on a novel mapping from real-world data to Hilbert space. This mapping maintains the distance relations present in the data and reduces information loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms competitive state-of-the-art models with only 1.68\% parameters compared to those models.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated superior performance over classical machine learning to support many features in safety-critical systems. Although DNNs are now widely used in such systems (e.g., self driving cars), there is limited progress regarding automated support for functional safety analysis in DNN-based systems. For example, the identification of root causes of errors, to enable both risk analysis and DNN retraining, remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose SAFE, a black-box approach to automatically characterize the root causes of DNN errors. SAFE relies on a transfer learning model pre-trained on ImageNet to extract the features from error-inducing images. It then applies a density-based clustering algorithm to detect arbitrary shaped clusters of images modeling plausible causes of error. Last, clusters are used to effectively retrain and improve the DNN. The black-box nature of SAFE is motivated by our objective not to require changes or even access to the DNN internals to facilitate adoption.
  Experimental results show the superior ability of SAFE in identifying different root causes of DNN errors based on case studies in the automotive domain. It also yields significant improvements in DNN accuracy after retraining, while saving significant execution time and memory when compared to alternatives.

**Abstract:** The marine ecosystem is changing at an alarming rate, exhibiting biodiversity loss and the migration of tropical species to temperate basins. Monitoring the underwater environments and their inhabitants is of fundamental importance to understand the evolution of these systems and implement safeguard policies. However, assessing and tracking biodiversity is often a complex task, especially in large and uncontrolled environments, such as the oceans. One of the most popular and effective methods for monitoring marine biodiversity is passive acoustics monitoring (PAM), which employs hydrophones to capture underwater sound. Many aquatic animals produce sounds characteristic of their own species; these signals travel efficiently underwater and can be detected even at great distances. Furthermore, modern technologies are becoming more and more convenient and precise, allowing for very accurate and careful data acquisition. To date, audio captured with PAM devices is frequently manually processed by marine biologists and interpreted with traditional signal processing techniques for the detection of animal vocalizations. This is a challenging task, as PAM recordings are often over long periods of time. Moreover, one of the causes of biodiversity loss is sound pollution; in data obtained from regions with loud anthropic noise, it is hard to separate the artificial from the fish sound manually. Nowadays, machine learning and, in particular, deep learning represents the state of the art for processing audio signals. Specifically, sound separation networks are able to identify and separate human voices and musical instruments. In this work, we show that the same techniques can be successfully used to automatically extract fish vocalizations in PAM recordings, opening up the possibility for biodiversity monitoring at a large scale.

**Abstract:** This work examines the possibility of using syllable embeddings, instead of the often used $n$-gram embeddings, as subword embeddings. We investigate this for two languages: English and Dutch. To this end, we also translated two standard English word embedding evaluation datasets, WordSim353 and SemEval-2017, to Dutch. Furthermore, we provide the research community with data sets of syllabic decompositions for both languages. We compare our approach to full word and $n$-gram embeddings. Compared to full word embeddings, we obtain English models that are 20 to 30 times smaller while retaining 80% of the performance. For Dutch, models are 15 times smaller for 70% performance retention. Although less accurate than the $n$-gram baseline we used, our models can be trained in a matter of minutes, as opposed to hours for the $n$-gram approach. We identify a path toward upgrading performance in future work. All code is made publicly available, as well as our collected English and Dutch syllabic decompositions and Dutch evaluation set translations.

**Abstract:** Link prediction plays an significant role in knowledge graph, which is an important resource for many artificial intelligence tasks, but it is often limited by incompleteness. In this paper, we propose knowledge graph BERT for link prediction, named LP-BERT, which contains two training stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph fine-tuning. The pre-training strategy not only uses Mask Language Model (MLM) to learn the knowledge of context corpus, but also introduces Mask Entity Model (MEM) and Mask Relation Model (MRM), which can learn the relationship information from triples by predicting semantic based entity and relation elements. Structured triple relation information can be transformed into unstructured semantic information, which can be integrated into the pre-training model together with context corpus information. In the fine-tuning phase, inspired by contrastive learning, we carry out a triple-style negative sampling in sample batch, which greatly increased the proportion of negative sampling while keeping the training time almost unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation method based on the inverse relationship of triples to further increase the sample diversity. We achieve state-of-the-art results on WN18RR and UMLS datasets, especially the Hits@10 indicator improved by 5\% from the previous state-of-the-art result on WN18RR dataset.

**Abstract:** The aim of this paper is to describe a novel non-parametric noise reduction technique from the point of view of Bayesian inference that may automatically improve the signal-to-noise ratio of one- and two-dimensional data, such as e.g. astronomical images and spectra. The algorithm iteratively evaluates possible smoothed versions of the data, the smooth models, obtaining an estimation of the underlying signal that is statistically compatible with the noisy measurements. Iterations stop based on the evidence and the $Ï^2$ statistic of the last smooth model, and we compute the expected value of the signal as a weighted average of the whole set of smooth models. In this paper, we explain the mathematical formalism and numerical implementation of the algorithm, and we evaluate its performance in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio, the structural similarity index, and the time payload, using a battery of real astronomical observations. Our Fully Adaptive Bayesian Algorithm for Data Analysis (FABADA) yields results that, without any parameter tuning, are comparable to standard image processing algorithms whose parameters have been optimized based on the true signal to be recovered, something that is impossible in a real application. State-of-the-art non-parametric methods, such as BM3D, offer slightly better performance at high signal-to-noise ratio, while our algorithm is significantly more accurate for extremely noisy data (higher than $20-40\%$ relative errors, a situation of particular interest in the field of astronomy). In this range, the standard deviation of the residuals obtained by our reconstruction may become more than an order of magnitude lower than that of the original measurements. The source code needed to reproduce all the results presented in this report, including the implementation of the method, is publicly available at https://github.com/PabloMSanAla/fabada

**Abstract:** Learning and synthesizing stabilizing controllers for unknown nonlinear systems is a challenging problem for real-world and industrial applications. Koopman operator theory allow one to analyze nonlinear systems through the lens of linear systems and nonlinear control systems through the lens of bilinear control systems. The key idea of these methods, lies in the transformation of the coordinates of the nonlinear system into the Koopman observables, which are coordinates that allow the representation of the original system (control system) as a higher dimensional linear (bilinear control) system. However, for nonlinear control systems, the bilinear control model obtained by applying Koopman operator based learning methods is not necessarily stabilizable and therefore, the existence of a stabilizing feedback control is not guaranteed which is crucial for many real world applications. Simultaneous identification of these stabilizable Koopman based bilinear control systems as well as the associated Koopman observables is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a framework to identify and construct these stabilizable bilinear models and its associated observables from data by simultaneously learning a bilinear Koopman embedding for the underlying unknown nonlinear control system as well as a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) for the Koopman based bilinear model using a learner and falsifier. Our proposed approach thereby provides provable guarantees of global asymptotic stability for the nonlinear control systems with unknown dynamics. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the efficacy of our proposed class of stabilizing feedback controllers for unknown nonlinear systems.

**Abstract:** Neyman-Scott processes (NSPs) are point process models that generate clusters of points in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of phenomena, ranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering property is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of latent events is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event generates a set of observed data points according to another Poisson process. This construction is similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events (i.e. clusters) is a random variable, but the point process formulation makes the NSP especially well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many specialized algorithms have been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works have focused on inference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between NSPs and DPMMs, with the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture models called mixture of finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this connection, we adapt the standard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs to enable scalable Bayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the potential of Neyman-Scott processes on a variety of applications including sequence detection in neural spike trains and event detection in document streams.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning and recently Deep Reinforcement Learning are popular methods for solving sequential decision making problems modeled as Markov Decision Processes. RL modeling of a problem and selecting algorithms and hyper-parameters require careful considerations as different configurations may entail completely different performances. These considerations are mainly the task of RL experts; however, RL is progressively becoming popular in other fields where the researchers and system designers are not RL experts. Besides, many modeling decisions, such as defining state and action space, size of batches and frequency of batch updating, and number of timesteps are typically made manually. For these reasons, automating different components of RL framework is of great importance and it has attracted much attention in recent years. Automated RL provides a framework in which different components of RL including MDP modeling, algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimization are modeled and defined automatically. In this article, we explore the literature and present recent work that can be used in automated RL. Moreover, we discuss the challenges, open questions and research directions in AutoRL.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a realistic image generation method for visualization in endoscopic simulation systems. Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment are performed in many hospitals. To reduce complications related to endoscope insertions, endoscopic simulation systems are used for training or rehearsal of endoscope insertions. However, current simulation systems generate non-realistic virtual endoscopic images. To improve the value of the simulation systems, improvement of reality of their generated images is necessary. We propose a realistic image generation method for endoscopic simulation systems. Virtual endoscopic images are generated by using a volume rendering method from a CT volume of a patient. We improve the reality of the virtual endoscopic images using a virtual-to-real image-domain translation technique. The image-domain translator is implemented as a fully convolutional network (FCN). We train the FCN by minimizing a cycle consistency loss function. The FCN is trained using unpaired virtual and real endoscopic images. To obtain high quality image-domain translation results, we perform an image cleansing to the real endoscopic image set. We tested to use the shallow U-Net, U-Net, deep U-Net, and U-Net having residual units as the image-domain translator. The deep U-Net and U-Net having residual units generated quite realistic images.

**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained task of sentiment analysis. To better comprehend long complicated sentences and obtain accurate aspect-specific information, linguistic and commonsense knowledge are generally required in this task. However, most methods employ complicated and inefficient approaches to incorporate external knowledge, e.g., directly searching the graph nodes. Additionally, the complementarity between external knowledge and linguistic information has not been thoroughly studied. To this end, we propose a knowledge graph augmented network (KGAN), which aims to effectively incorporate external knowledge with explicitly syntactic and contextual information. In particular, KGAN captures the sentiment feature representations from multiple different perspectives, i.e., context-, syntax- and knowledge-based. First, KGAN learns the contextual and syntactic representations in parallel to fully extract the semantic features. Then, KGAN integrates the knowledge graphs into the embedding space, based on which the aspect-specific knowledge representations are further obtained via an attention mechanism. Last, we propose a hierarchical fusion module to complement these multiview representations in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments on three popular ABSA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our KGAN. Notably, with the help of the pretrained model of RoBERTa, KGAN achieves a new record of state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Recursive neural networks (Tree-RNNs) based on dependency trees are ubiquitous in modeling sentence meanings as they effectively capture semantic relationships between non-neighborhood words. However, recognizing semantically dissimilar sentences with the same words and syntax is still a challenge to Tree-RNNs. This work proposes an improvement to Dependency Tree-RNN (DT-RNN) using the grammatical relationship type identified in the dependency parse. Our experiments on semantic relatedness scoring (SRS) and recognizing textual entailment (RTE) in sentence pairs using SICK (Sentence Involving Compositional Knowledge) dataset show encouraging results. The model achieved a 2% improvement in classification accuracy for the RTE task over the DT-RNN model. The results show that Pearson's and Spearman's correlation measures between the model's predicted similarity scores and human ratings are higher than those of standard DT-RNNs.

**Abstract:** The recently proposed Neural Local Lossless Compression (NeLLoC), which is based on a local autoregressive model, has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance in the image compression task. In addition to the encouragement of OOD generalization, the local model also allows parallel inference in the decoding stage. In this paper, we propose a parallelization scheme for local autoregressive models. We discuss the practicalities of implementing this scheme, and provide experimental evidence of significant gains in compression runtime compared to the previous, non-parallel implementation.

**Abstract:** Rationales, snippets of extracted text that explain an inference, have emerged as a popular framework for interpretable natural language processing (NLP). Rationale models typically consist of two cooperating modules: a selector and a classifier with the goal of maximizing the mutual information (MMI) between the "selected" text and the document label. Despite their promises, MMI-based methods often pick up on spurious text patterns and result in models with nonsensical behaviors. In this work, we investigate whether counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), without human assistance, can improve the performance of the selector by lowering the mutual information between spurious signals and the document label. Our counterfactuals are produced in an unsupervised fashion using class-dependent generative models. From an information theoretic lens, we derive properties of the unaugmented dataset for which our CDA approach would succeed. The effectiveness of CDA is empirically evaluated by comparing against several baselines including an improved MMI-based rationale schema on two multi aspect datasets. Our results show that CDA produces rationales that better capture the signal of interest.

<p>

**Abstract:** Successful deep learning models often involve training neural network architectures that contain more parameters than the number of training samples. Such overparametrized models have been extensively studied in recent years, and the virtues of overparametrization have been established from both the statistical perspective, via the double-descent phenomenon, and the computational perspective via the structural properties of the optimization landscape.
  Despite the remarkable success of deep learning architectures in the overparametrized regime, it is also well known that these models are highly vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. Even when adversarially trained, their performance on perturbed inputs (robust generalization) is considerably worse than their best attainable performance on benign inputs (standard generalization). It is thus imperative to understand how overparametrization fundamentally affects robustness.
  In this paper, we will provide a precise characterization of the role of overparametrization on robustness by focusing on random features regression models (two-layer neural networks with random first layer weights). We consider a regime where the sample size, the input dimension and the number of parameters grow in proportion to each other, and derive an asymptotically exact formula for the robust generalization error when the model is adversarially trained. Our developed theory reveals the nontrivial effect of overparametrization on robustness and indicates that for adversarially trained random features models, high overparametrization can hurt robust generalization.

**Abstract:** In the context of reinforcement learning we introduce the concept of criticality of a state, which indicates the extent to which the choice of action in that particular state influences the expected return. That is, a state in which the choice of action is more likely to influence the final outcome is considered as more critical than a state in which it is less likely to influence the final outcome.
  We formulate a criticality-based varying step number algorithm (CVS) - a flexible step number algorithm that utilizes the criticality function provided by a human, or learned directly from the environment. We test it in three different domains including the Atari Pong environment, Road-Tree environment, and Shooter environment. We demonstrate that CVS is able to outperform popular learning algorithms such as Deep Q-Learning and Monte Carlo.

**Abstract:** Graph problems such as traveling salesman problem, or finding minimal Steiner trees are widely studied and used in data engineering and computer science. Typically, in real-world applications, the features of the graph tend to change over time, thus, finding a solution to the problem becomes challenging. The dynamic version of many graph problems are the key for a plethora of real-world problems in transportation, telecommunication, and social networks. In recent years, using deep learning techniques to find heuristic solutions for NP-hard graph combinatorial problems has gained much interest as these learned heuristics can find near-optimal solutions efficiently. However, most of the existing methods for learning heuristics focus on static graph problems. The dynamic nature makes NP-hard graph problems much more challenging to learn, and the existing methods fail to find reasonable solutions.
  In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Graph Temporal Attention with Reinforcement Learning (GTA-RL) to learn heuristic solutions for graph-based dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. The GTA-RL architecture consists of an encoder capable of embedding temporal features of a combinatorial problem instance and a decoder capable of dynamically focusing on the embedded features to find a solution to a given combinatorial problem instance. We then extend our architecture to learn heuristics for the real-time version of combinatorial optimization problems where all input features of a problem are not known a prior, but rather learned in real-time. Our experimental results against several state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms and optimal solvers demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches in terms of effectiveness and optimal solvers in terms of efficiency on dynamic and real-time graph combinatorial optimization.

**Abstract:** Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task to determine the sense of an ambiguous word in a given context. Previous approaches for WSD have focused on supervised and knowledge-based methods, but inter-sense interactions patterns or regularities for disambiguation remain to be found. We argue the following cause as one of the major difficulties behind finding the right patterns: for a particular context, the intended senses of a sequence of ambiguous words are dependent on each other, i.e. the choice of one word's sense is associated with the choice of another word's sense, making WSD a combinatorial optimization problem.In this work, we approach the interactions between senses of different target words by a Quadratic 0-1 Integer Programming model (QIP) that maximizes the objective function consisting of (1) the similarity between candidate senses of a target word and the word in a context (the sense-word similarity), and (2) the semantic interactions (relatedness) between senses of all words in the context (the sense-sense relatedness).

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have succeeded in many practical applications. However, their high computation and storage requirements often make them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. In order to tackle this issue, many pruning algorithms have been proposed for CNNs, but most of them can't prune CNNs to a reasonable level. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for training and pruning CNNs based on the recursive least squares (RLS) optimization. After training a CNN for some epochs, our algorithm combines inverse input autocorrelation matrices and weight matrices to evaluate and prune unimportant input channels or nodes layer by layer. Then, our algorithm will continue to train the pruned network, and won't do the next pruning until the pruned network recovers the full performance of the old network. Besides for CNNs, the proposed algorithm can be used for feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Three experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets show that our algorithm can achieve the more reasonable pruning and have higher learning efficiency than other four popular pruning algorithms.

**Abstract:** In this paper, based on results of exact learning, test theory, and rough set theory, we study arbitrary infinite families of concepts each of which consists of an infinite set of elements and an infinite set of subsets of this set called concepts. We consider the notion of a problem over a family of concepts that is described by a finite number of elements: for a given concept, we should recognize which of the elements under consideration belong to this concept. As algorithms for problem solving, we consider decision trees of five types: (i) using membership queries, (ii) using equivalence queries, (iii) using both membership and equivalence queries, (iv) using proper equivalence queries, and (v) using both membership and proper equivalence queries. As time complexity, we study the depth of decision trees. In the worst case, with the growth of the number of elements in the problem description, the minimum depth of decision trees of the first type either grows as a logarithm or linearly, and the minimum depth of decision trees of each of the other types either is bounded from above by a constant or grows as a logarithm, or linearly. The obtained results allow us to distinguish seven complexity classes of infinite families of concepts.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce an important yet relatively unexplored NLP task called Multi-Narrative Semantic Overlap (MNSO), which entails generating a Semantic Overlap of multiple alternate narratives. As no benchmark dataset is readily available for this task, we created one by crawling 2,925 narrative pairs from the web and then, went through the tedious process of manually creating 411 different ground-truth semantic overlaps by engaging human annotators. As a way to evaluate this novel task, we first conducted a systematic study by borrowing the popular ROUGE metric from text-summarization literature and discovered that ROUGE is not suitable for our task. Subsequently, we conducted further human annotations/validations to create 200 document-level and 1,518 sentence-level ground-truth labels which helped us formulate a new precision-recall style evaluation metric, called SEM-F1 (semantic F1). Experimental results show that the proposed SEM-F1 metric yields higher correlation with human judgement as well as higher inter-rater-agreement compared to ROUGE metric.

**Abstract:** Over the past several years, a slew of different methods to measure the fairness of a machine learning model have been proposed. However, despite the growing number of publications and implementations, there is still a critical lack of literature that explains the interplay of fair machine learning with the social sciences of philosophy, sociology, and law. We hope to remedy this issue by accumulating and expounding upon the thoughts and discussions of fair machine learning produced by both social and formal (specifically machine learning and statistics) sciences in this field guide. Specifically, in addition to giving the mathematical and algorithmic backgrounds of several popular statistical and causal-based fair machine learning methods, we explain the underlying philosophical and legal thoughts that support them. Further, we explore several criticisms of the current approaches to fair machine learning from sociological and philosophical viewpoints. It is our hope that this field guide will help fair machine learning practitioners better understand how their algorithms align with important humanistic values (such as fairness) and how we can, as a field, design methods and metrics to better serve oppressed and marginalized populaces.

**Abstract:** I propose kernel ridge regression estimators for long term causal inference, where a short term experimental data set containing randomized treatment and short term surrogates is fused with a long term observational data set containing short term surrogates and long term outcomes. I propose estimators of treatment effects, dose responses, and counterfactual distributions with closed form solutions in terms of kernel matrix operations. I allow covariates, treatment, and surrogates to be discrete or continuous, and low, high, or infinite dimensional. For long term treatment effects, I prove $\sqrt{n}$ consistency, Gaussian approximation, and semiparametric efficiency. For long term dose responses, I prove uniform consistency with finite sample rates. For long term counterfactual distributions, I prove convergence in distribution.

**Abstract:** Hyperparameter plays an essential role in the fitting of supervised machine learning algorithms. However, it is computationally expensive to tune all the tunable hyperparameters simultaneously especially for large data sets. In this paper, we give a definition of hyperparameter importance that can be estimated by subsampling procedures. According to the importance, hyperparameters can then be tuned on the entire data set more efficiently. We show theoretically that the proposed importance on subsets of data is consistent with the one on the population data under weak conditions. Numerical experiments show that the proposed importance is consistent and can save a lot of computational resources.

**Abstract:** Many statistical machine approaches could ultimately highlight novel features of the etiology of complex diseases by analyzing multi-omics data. However, they are sensitive to some deviations in distribution when the observed samples are potentially contaminated with adversarial corrupted outliers (e.g., a fictional data distribution). Likewise, statistical advances lag in supporting comprehensive data-driven analyses of complex multi-omics data integration. We propose a novel non-linear M-estimator-based approach, "robust kernel machine regression (RobKMR)," to improve the robustness of statistical machine regression and the diversity of fictional data to examine the higher-order composite effect of multi-omics datasets. We address a robust kernel-centered Gram matrix to estimate the model parameters accurately. We also propose a robust score test to assess the marginal and joint Hadamard product of features from multi-omics data. We apply our proposed approach to a multi-omics dataset of osteoporosis (OP) from Caucasian females. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies the inter-related risk factors of OP. With solid evidence (p-value = 0.00001), biological validations, network-based analysis, causal inference, and drug repurposing, the selected three triplets ((DKK1, SMTN, DRGX), (MTND5, FASTKD2, CSMD3), (MTND5, COG3, CSMD3)) are significant biomarkers and directly relate to BMD. Overall, the top three selected genes (DKK1, MTND5, FASTKD2) and one gene (SIDT1 at p-value= 0.001) significantly bond with four drugs- Tacrolimus, Ibandronate, Alendronate, and Bazedoxifene out of 30 candidates for drug repurposing in OP. Further, the proposed approach can be applied to any disease model where multi-omics datasets are available.

**Abstract:** Machine learning techniques typically applied to dementia forecasting lack in their capabilities to jointly learn several tasks, handle time dependent heterogeneous data and missing values. In this paper, we propose a framework using the recently presented SSHIBA model for jointly learning different tasks on longitudinal data with missing values. The method uses Bayesian variational inference to impute missing values and combine information of several views. This way, we can combine different data-views from different time-points in a common latent space and learn the relations between each time-point while simultaneously modelling and predicting several output variables. We apply this model to predict together diagnosis, ventricle volume, and clinical scores in dementia. The results demonstrate that SSHIBA is capable of learning a good imputation of the missing values and outperforming the baselines while simultaneously predicting three different tasks.

**Abstract:** Adaptive partial linear beamforming meets the need of 5G and future 6G applications for high flexibility and adaptability. Choosing an appropriate tradeoff between conflicting goals opens the recently proposed multiuser (MU) detection method. Due to their high spatial resolution, nonlinear beamforming filters can significantly outperform linear approaches in stationary scenarios with massive connectivity. However, a dramatic decrease in performance can be expected in high mobility scenarios because they are very susceptible to changes in the wireless channel. The robustness of linear filters is required, considering these changes. One way to respond appropriately is to use online machine learning algorithms. The theory of algorithms based on the adaptive projected subgradient method (APSM) is rich, and they promise accurate tracking capabilities in dynamic wireless environments. However, one of the main challenges comes from the real-time implementation of these algorithms, which involve projections on time-varying closed convex sets. While the projection operations are relatively simple, their vast number poses a challenge in ultralow latency (ULL) applications where latency constraints must be satisfied in every radio frame. Taking non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems as an example, this paper explores the acceleration of APSM-based algorithms through massive parallelization. The result is a GPU-accelerated real-time implementation of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based transceiver that enables detection latency of less than one millisecond and therefore complies with the requirements of 5G and beyond. To meet the stringent physical layer latency requirements, careful co-design of hardware and software is essential, especially in virtualized wireless systems with hardware accelerators.

**Abstract:** We develop a methodology to construct low-dimensional predictive models from data sets representing essentially nonlinear (or non-linearizable) dynamical systems with a hyperbolic linear part that are subject to external forcing with finitely many frequencies. Our data-driven, sparse, nonlinear models are obtained as extended normal forms of the reduced dynamics on low-dimensional, attracting spectral submanifolds (SSMs) of the dynamical system. We illustrate the power of data-driven SSM reduction on high-dimensional numerical data sets and experimental measurements involving beam oscillations, vortex shedding and sloshing in a water tank. We find that SSM reduction trained on unforced data also predicts nonlinear response accurately under additional external forcing.

**Abstract:** Various deep learning models have been developed to segment anatomical structures from medical images, but they typically have poor performance when tested on another target domain with different data distribution. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed to alleviate this so-called domain shift issue, but most of them are designed for scenarios with relatively small domain shifts and are likely to fail when encountering a large domain gap. In this paper, we propose DCDA, a novel cross-modality unsupervised domain adaptation framework for tasks with large domain shifts, e.g., segmenting retinal vessels from OCTA and OCT images. DCDA mainly consists of a disentangling representation style transfer (DRST) module and a collaborative consistency learning (CCL) module. DRST decomposes images into content components and style codes and performs style transfer and image reconstruction. CCL contains two segmentation models, one for source domain and the other for target domain. The two models use labeled data (together with the corresponding transferred images) for supervised learning and perform collaborative consistency learning on unlabeled data. Each model focuses on the corresponding single domain and aims to yield an expertized domain-specific segmentation model. Through extensive experiments on retinal vessel segmentation, our framework achieves Dice scores close to target-trained oracle both from OCTA to OCT and from OCT to OCTA, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Multistage sequential decision-making scenarios are commonly seen in the healthcare diagnosis process. In this paper, an active learning-based method is developed to actively collect only the necessary patient data in a sequential manner. There are two novelties in the proposed method. First, unlike the existing ordinal logistic regression model which only models a single stage, we estimate the parameters for all stages together. Second, it is assumed that the coefficients for common features in different stages are kept consistent. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in both a simulation study and a real case study. Compared with the baseline method where the data is modeled individually and independently, the proposed method improves the estimation efficiency by 62\%-1838\%. For both simulation and testing cohorts, the proposed method is more effective, stable, interpretable, and computationally efficient on parameter estimation. The proposed method can be easily extended to a variety of scenarios where decision-making can be done sequentially with only necessary information.

**Abstract:** A neural network with the widely-used ReLU activation has been shown to partition the sample space into many convex polytopes for prediction. However, the parameterized way a neural network and other machine learning models use to partition the space has imperfections, e.g., the compromised interpretability for complex models, the inflexibility in decision boundary construction due to the generic character of the model, and the risk of being trapped into shortcut solutions. In contrast, although the non-parameterized models can adorably avoid or downplay these issues, they are usually insufficiently powerful either due to over-simplification or the failure to accommodate the manifold structures of data. In this context, we first propose a new type of machine learning models referred to as Manifoldron that directly derives decision boundaries from data and partitions the space via manifold structure discovery. Then, we systematically analyze the key characteristics of the Manifoldron including interpretability, manifold characterization capability, and its link to neural networks. The experimental results on 9 small and 11 large datasets demonstrate that the proposed Manifoldron performs competitively compared to the mainstream machine learning models.

**Abstract:** The increasing automation in many areas of the Industry expressly demands to design efficient machine-learning solutions for the detection of abnormal events. With the ubiquitous deployment of sensors monitoring nearly continuously the health of complex infrastructures, anomaly detection can now rely on measurements sampled at a very high frequency, providing a very rich representation of the phenomenon under surveillance. In order to exploit fully the information thus collected, the observations cannot be treated as multivariate data anymore and a functional analysis approach is required. It is the purpose of this paper to investigate the performance of recent techniques for anomaly detection in the functional setup on real datasets. After an overview of the state-of-the-art and a visual-descriptive study, a variety of anomaly detection methods are compared. While taxonomies of abnormalities (e.g. shape, location) in the functional setup are documented in the literature, assigning a specific type to the identified anomalies appears to be a challenging task. Thus, strengths and weaknesses of the existing approaches are benchmarked in view of these highlighted types in a simulation study. Anomaly detection methods are next evaluated on two datasets, related to the monitoring of helicopters in flight and to the spectrometry of construction materials namely. The benchmark analysis is concluded by recommendation guidance for practitioners.

**Abstract:** With the fast development of machine learning technologies, deep learning models have been deployed in almost every aspect of everyday life. However, the privacy and security of these models are threatened by adversarial attacks. Among which black-box attack is closer to reality, where limited knowledge can be acquired from the model. In this paper, we provided basic background knowledge about adversarial attack and analyzed four black-box attack algorithms: Bandits, NES, Square Attack and ZOsignSGD comprehensively. We also explored the newly proposed Square Attack method with respect to square size, hoping to improve its query efficiency.

**Abstract:** With the proliferation of AI-enabled software systems in smart manufacturing, the role of such systems moves away from a reactive to a proactive role that provides context-specific support to manufacturing operators. In the frame of the EU funded Teaming.AI project, we identified the monitoring of teaming aspects in human-AI collaboration, the runtime monitoring and validation of ethical policies, and the support for experimentation with data and machine learning algorithms as the most relevant challenges for human-AI teaming in smart manufacturing. Based on these challenges, we developed a reference software architecture based on knowledge graphs, tracking and scene analysis, and components for relational machine learning with a particular focus on its scalability. Our approach uses knowledge graphs to capture product- and process specific knowledge in the manufacturing process and to utilize it for relational machine learning. This allows for context-specific recommendations for actions in the manufacturing process for the optimization of product quality and the prevention of physical harm. The empirical validation of this software architecture will be conducted in cooperation with three large-scale companies in the automotive, energy systems, and precision machining domain. In this paper we discuss the identified challenges for such a reference software architecture, present its preliminary status, and sketch our further research vision in this project.

**Abstract:** Given access to a machine learning model, can an adversary reconstruct the model's training data? This work studies this question from the lens of a powerful informed adversary who knows all the training data points except one. By instantiating concrete attacks, we show it is feasible to reconstruct the remaining data point in this stringent threat model. For convex models (e.g. logistic regression), reconstruction attacks are simple and can be derived in closed-form. For more general models (e.g. neural networks), we propose an attack strategy based on training a reconstructor network that receives as input the weights of the model under attack and produces as output the target data point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on image classifiers trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and systematically investigate which factors of standard machine learning pipelines affect reconstruction success. Finally, we theoretically investigate what amount of differential privacy suffices to mitigate reconstruction attacks by informed adversaries. Our work provides an effective reconstruction attack that model developers can use to assess memorization of individual points in general settings beyond those considered in previous works (e.g. generative language models or access to training gradients); it shows that standard models have the capacity to store enough information to enable high-fidelity reconstruction of training data points; and it demonstrates that differential privacy can successfully mitigate such attacks in a parameter regime where utility degradation is minimal.

**Abstract:** Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis has achieved unprecedented performance in breast cancer detection. However, most approaches are computationally intensive, which impedes their broader dissemination in real-world applications. In this work, we propose an efficient and light-weighted multitask learning architecture to classify and segment breast tumors simultaneously. We incorporate a segmentation task into a tumor classification network, which makes the backbone network learn representations focused on tumor regions. Moreover, we propose a new numerically stable loss function that easily controls the balance between the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection. The proposed approach is evaluated using a breast ultrasound dataset with 1,511 images. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of tumor classification is 88.6%, 94.1%, and 85.3%, respectively. We validate the model using a virtual mobile device, and the average inference time is 0.35 seconds per image.

**Abstract:** In order to develop complex relationships between their inputs and outputs, deep neural networks train and adjust large number of parameters. To make these networks work at high accuracy, vast amounts of data are needed. Sometimes, however, the quantity of data needed is not present or obtainable for training. Neuron-specific dropout (NSDropout) is a tool to address this problem. NSDropout looks at both the training pass, and validation pass, of a layer in a model. By comparing the average values produced by each neuron for each class in a data set, the network is able to drop targeted units. The layer is able to predict what features, or noise, the model is looking at during testing that isn't present when looking at samples from validation. Unlike dropout, the "thinned" networks cannot be "unthinned" for testing. Neuron-specific dropout has proved to achieve similar, if not better, testing accuracy with far less data than traditional methods including dropout and other regularization methods. Experimentation has shown that neuron-specific dropout reduces the chance of a network overfitting and reduces the need for large training samples on supervised learning tasks in image recognition, all while producing best-in-class results.

**Abstract:** Statistical depths provide a fundamental generalization of quantiles and medians to data in higher dimensions. This paper proposes a new type of globally defined statistical depth, based upon control theory and eikonal equations, which measures the smallest amount of probability density that has to be passed through in a path to points outside the support of the distribution: for example spatial infinity. This depth is easy to interpret and compute, expressively captures multi-modal behavior, and extends naturally to data that is non-Euclidean. We prove various properties of this depth, and provide discussion of computational considerations. In particular, we demonstrate that this notion of depth is robust under an aproximate isometrically constrained adversarial model, a property which is not enjoyed by the Tukey depth. Finally we give some illustrative examples in the context of two-dimensional mixture models and MNIST.

**Abstract:** The task of finding the best developer to fix a bug is called bug triage. Most of the existing approaches consider the bug triage task as a classification problem, however, classification is not appropriate when the sets of classes change over time (as developers often do in a project). Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, all the existing models use textual sources of information, i.e., bug descriptions, which are not always available.
  In this work, we explore the applicability of existing solutions for the bug triage problem when stack traces are used as the main data source of bug reports. Additionally, we reformulate this task as a ranking problem and propose new deep learning models to solve it. The models are based on a bidirectional recurrent neural network with attention and on a convolutional neural network, with the weights of the models optimized using a ranking loss function. To improve the quality of ranking, we propose using additional information from version control system annotations. Two approaches are proposed for extracting features from annotations: manual and using an additional neural network. To evaluate our models, we collected two datasets of real-world stack traces. Our experiments show that the proposed models outperform existing models adapted to handle stack traces. To facilitate further research in this area, we publish the source code of our models and one of the collected datasets.

**Abstract:** Approximations of optimization problems arise in computational procedures and sensitivity analysis. The resulting effect on solutions can be significant, with even small approximations of components of a problem translating into large errors in the solutions. We specify conditions under which approximations are well behaved in the sense of minimizers, stationary points, and level-sets and this leads to a framework of consistent approximations. The framework is developed for a broad class of composite problems, which are neither convex nor smooth. We demonstrate the framework using examples from stochastic optimization, neural-network based machine learning, distributionally robust optimization, penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods, interior-point methods, homotopy methods, smoothing methods, extended nonlinear programming, difference-of-convex programming, and multi-objective optimization. An enhanced proximal method illustrates the algorithmic possibilities. A quantitative analysis supplements the development by furnishing rates of convergence.

**Abstract:** We present a novel method for controlling extrapolation in the prediction profiler in the JMP software. The prediction profiler is a graphical tool for exploring high dimensional prediction surfaces for statistical and machine learning models. The profiler contains interactive cross-sectional views, or profile traces, of the prediction surface of a model. Our method helps users avoid exploring predictions that should be considered extrapolation. It also performs optimization over a constrained factor region that avoids extrapolation using a genetic algorithm. In simulations and real world examples, we demonstrate how optimal factor settings without constraint in the profiler are frequently extrapolated, and how extrapolation control helps avoid these solutions with invalid factor settings that may not be useful to the user.

**Abstract:** In this paper, a straightforward enhancement learning algorithm based on Separation Index (SI) concept is proposed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). At first, the SI as a supervised complexity measure is explained its usage in better learning of CNNs for classification problems illustrate. Then, a learning strategy proposes through which the first layer of a CNN is optimized by maximizing the SI, and the further layers are trained through the backpropagation algorithm to learn further layers. In order to maximize the SI at the first layer, A variant of ranking loss is optimized by using the quasi least square error technique. Applying such a learning strategy to some known CNNs and datasets, its enhancement impact in almost all cases is demonstrated.

**Abstract:** Automatic code summarization is beneficial to software development and maintenance since it reduces the burden of manual tasks. Currently, artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift. The foundation models pretrained on massive data and finetuned to downstream tasks surpass specially customized models. This trend inspired us to consider reusing foundation models instead of learning from scratch. Based on this, we propose a flexible and robust approach for automatic code summarization based on neural networks. We assemble available foundation models, such as CodeBERT and GPT-2, into a single model named AdaMo. Moreover, we utilize Gaussian noise as the simulation of contextual information to optimize the latent representation. Furthermore, we introduce two adaptive schemes from the perspective of knowledge transfer, namely continuous pretraining and intermediate finetuning, and design intermediate stage tasks for general sequence-to-sequence learning. Finally, we evaluate AdaMo against a benchmark dataset for code summarization, by comparing it with state-of-the-art models.

**Abstract:** Most conventional crowd counting methods utilize a fully-supervised learning framework to learn a mapping between scene images and crowd density maps. Under the circumstances of such fully-supervised training settings, a large quantity of expensive and time-consuming pixel-level annotations are required to generate density maps as the supervision. One way to reduce costly labeling is to exploit self-structural information and inner-relations among unlabeled images. Unlike the previous methods utilizing these relations and structural information from the original image level, we explore such self-relations from the latent feature spaces because it can extract more abundant relations and structural information. Specifically, we propose S$^2$FPR which can extract structural information and learn partial orders of coarse-to-fine pyramid features in the latent space for better crowd counting with massive unlabeled images. In addition, we collect a new unlabeled crowd counting dataset (FUDAN-UCC) with 4,000 images in total for training. One by-product is that our proposed S$^2$FPR method can leverage numerous partial orders in the latent space among unlabeled images to strengthen the model representation capability and reduce the estimation errors for the crowd counting task. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, i.e. the UCF-QNRF, the ShanghaiTech PartA and PartB, and the UCF-CC-50, show the effectiveness of our method compared with previous semi-supervised methods. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/bridgeqiqi/S2FPR.
