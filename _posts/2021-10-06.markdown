**Abstract:** A "bigger is better" explosion in the number of parameters in deep neural networks has made it increasingly challenging to make state-of-the-art networks accessible in compute-restricted environments. Compression techniques have taken on renewed importance as a way to bridge the gap. However, evaluation of the trade-offs incurred by popular compression techniques has been centered on high-resource datasets. In this work, we instead consider the impact of compression in a data-limited regime. We introduce the term low-resource double bind to refer to the co-occurrence of data limitations and compute resource constraints. This is a common setting for NLP for low-resource languages, yet the trade-offs in performance are poorly studied. Our work offers surprising insights into the relationship between capacity and generalization in data-limited regimes for the task of machine translation. Our experiments on magnitude pruning for translations from English into Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo and German show that in low-resource regimes, sparsity preserves performance on frequent sentences but has a disparate impact on infrequent ones. However, it improves robustness to out-of-distribution shifts, especially for datasets that are very distinct from the training distribution. Our findings suggest that sparsity can play a beneficial role at curbing memorization of low frequency attributes, and therefore offers a promising solution to the low-resource double bind.

**Abstract:** Prior AI successes in complex games have largely focused on settings with at most hundreds of actions at each decision point. In contrast, Diplomacy is a game with more than 10^20 possible actions per turn. Previous attempts to address games with large branching factors, such as Diplomacy, StarCraft, and Dota, used human data to bootstrap the policy or used handcrafted reward shaping. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for action exploration and equilibrium approximation in games with combinatorial action spaces. This algorithm simultaneously performs value iteration while learning a policy proposal network. A double oracle step is used to explore additional actions to add to the policy proposals. At each state, the target state value and policy for the model training are computed via an equilibrium search procedure. Using this algorithm, we train an agent, DORA, completely from scratch for a popular two-player variant of Diplomacy and show that it achieves superhuman performance. Additionally, we extend our methods to full-scale no-press Diplomacy and for the first time train an agent from scratch with no human data. We present evidence that this agent plays a strategy that is incompatible with human-data bootstrapped agents. This presents the first strong evidence of multiple equilibria in Diplomacy and suggests that self play alone may be insufficient for achieving superhuman performance in Diplomacy.

**Abstract:** A video autoencoder is proposed for learning disentan- gled representations of 3D structure and camera pose from videos in a self-supervised manner. Relying on temporal continuity in videos, our work assumes that the 3D scene structure in nearby video frames remains static. Given a sequence of video frames as input, the video autoencoder extracts a disentangled representation of the scene includ- ing: (i) a temporally-consistent deep voxel feature to represent the 3D structure and (ii) a 3D trajectory of camera pose for each frame. These two representations will then be re-entangled for rendering the input video frames. This video autoencoder can be trained directly using a pixel reconstruction loss, without any ground truth 3D or camera pose annotations. The disentangled representation can be applied to a range of tasks, including novel view synthesis, camera pose estimation, and video generation by motion following. We evaluate our method on several large- scale natural video datasets, and show generalization results on out-of-domain images.

**Abstract:** Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) are the leading architecture for deep learning on graph-structured data, in large part due to their simplicity and scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost, we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive power and overall performance of popular GNN architectures.

**Abstract:** The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers raises a crucial challenge to design quantum neural networks for fully quantum learning tasks. To bridge the gap, this work proposes an end-to-end learning framework named QTN-VQC, by introducing a trainable quantum tensor network (QTN) for quantum embedding on a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The architecture of QTN is composed of a parametric tensor-train network for feature extraction and a tensor product encoding for quantum embedding. We highlight the QTN for quantum embedding in terms of two perspectives: (1) we theoretically characterize QTN by analyzing its representation power of input features; (2) QTN enables an end-to-end parametric model pipeline, namely QTN-VQC, from the generation of quantum embedding to the output measurement. Our experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate the advantages of QTN for quantum embedding over other quantum embedding approaches.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNN) can achieve high performance when applied to In-Distribution (ID) data which come from the same distribution as the training set. When presented with anomaly inputs not from the ID, the outputs of a DNN should be regarded as meaningless. However, modern DNN often predict anomaly inputs as an ID class with high confidence, which is dangerous and misleading. In this work, we consider three classes of anomaly inputs, (1) natural inputs from a different distribution than the DNN is trained for, known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples, (2) crafted inputs generated from ID by attackers, often known as adversarial (AD) samples, and (3) noise (NS) samples generated from meaningless data. We propose a framework that aims to detect all these anomalies for a pre-trained DNN. Unlike some of the existing works, our method does not require preprocessing of input data, nor is it dependent to any known OOD set or adversarial attack algorithm. Through extensive experiments over a variety of DNN models for the detection of aforementioned anomalies, we show that in most cases our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in identifying all three classes of anomalies.

**Abstract:** Climate change is a major threat to humanity, and the actions required to prevent its catastrophic consequences include changes in both policy-making and individual behaviour. However, taking action requires understanding the effects of climate change, even though they may seem abstract and distant. Projecting the potential consequences of extreme climate events such as flooding in familiar places can help make the abstract impacts of climate change more concrete and encourage action. As part of a larger initiative to build a website that projects extreme climate events onto user-chosen photos, we present our solution to simulate photo-realistic floods on authentic images. To address this complex task in the absence of suitable training data, we propose ClimateGAN, a model that leverages both simulated and real data for unsupervised domain adaptation and conditional image generation. In this paper, we describe the details of our framework, thoroughly evaluate components of our architecture and demonstrate that our model is capable of robustly generating photo-realistic flooding.

**Abstract:** The premise of this paper is that compliance with Trustworthy AI governance best practices and regulatory frameworks is an inherently fragmented process spanning across diverse organizational units, external stakeholders, and systems of record, resulting in process uncertainties and in compliance gaps that may expose organizations to reputational and regulatory risks. Moreover, there are complexities associated with meeting the specific dimensions of Trustworthy AI best practices such as data governance, conformance testing, quality assurance of AI model behaviors, transparency, accountability, and confidentiality requirements. These processes involve multiple steps, hand-offs, re-works, and human-in-the-loop oversight. In this paper, we demonstrate that process mining can provide a useful framework for gaining fact-based visibility to AI compliance process execution, surfacing compliance bottlenecks, and providing for an automated approach to analyze, remediate and monitor uncertainty in AI regulatory compliance processes.

**Abstract:** Graph is an important data representation ubiquitously existing in the real world. However, analyzing the graph data is computationally difficult due to its non-Euclidean nature. Graph embedding is a powerful tool to solve the graph analytics problem by transforming the graph data into low-dimensional vectors. These vectors could also be shared with third parties to gain additional insights of what is behind the data. While sharing graph embedding is intriguing, the associated privacy risks are unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate the information leakage of the graph embedding by mounting three inference attacks. First, we can successfully infer basic graph properties, such as the number of nodes, the number of edges, and graph density, of the target graph with up to 0.89 accuracy. Second, given a subgraph of interest and the graph embedding, we can determine with high confidence that whether the subgraph is contained in the target graph. For instance, we achieve 0.98 attack AUC on the DD dataset. Third, we propose a novel graph reconstruction attack that can reconstruct a graph that has similar graph structural statistics to the target graph. We further propose an effective defense mechanism based on graph embedding perturbation to mitigate the inference attacks without noticeable performance degradation for graph classification tasks.

**Abstract:** Retrieving clothes which are worn in social media videos (Instagram, TikTok) is the latest frontier of e-fashion, referred to as "video-to-shop" in the computer vision literature. In this paper we present MovingFashion, the first publicly available dataset to cope with this challenge. MovingFashion is composed of 14855 social videos, each one of them associated to e-commerce "shop" images where the corresponding clothing items are clearly portrayed. In addition, we present a network for retrieving the shop images in this scenario, dubbed SEAM Match-RCNN. The model is trained by image-to-video domain adaptation, allowing to use video sequences where only their association with a shop image is given, eliminating the need of millions of annotated bounding boxes. SEAM Match-RCNN builds an embedding, where an attention-based weighted sum of few frames (10) of a social video is enough to individuate the correct product within the first 5 retrieved items in a 14K+ shop element gallery with an accuracy of 80%. This provides the best performance on MovingFashion, comparing exhaustively against the related state-of-the-art approaches and alternative baselines.

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to possess strong representation power, which can be exploited for downstream prediction tasks on graph-structured data, such as molecules and social networks. They typically learn representations by aggregating information from the K-hop neighborhood of individual vertices or from the enumerated walks in the graph. Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating weighting schemes into GNNs; however, this has been primarily limited to K-hop neighborhood GNNs so far. In this paper, we aim to extensively analyze the effect of incorporating weighting schemes into walk-aggregating GNNs. Towards this objective, we propose a novel GNN model, called AWARE, that aggregates information about the walks in the graph using attention schemes in a principled way to obtain an end-to-end supervised learning method for graph-level prediction tasks. We perform theoretical, empirical, and interpretability analyses of AWARE. Our theoretical analysis provides the first provable guarantees for weighted GNNs, demonstrating how the graph information is encoded in the representation, and how the weighting schemes in AWARE affect the representation and learning performance. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of AWARE over prior baselines in the domains of molecular property prediction (61 tasks) and social networks (4 tasks). Our interpretation study illustrates that AWARE can successfully learn to capture the important substructures of the input graph.

**Abstract:** Clustering algorithms are one of the main analytical methods to detect patterns in unlabeled data. Existing clustering methods typically treat samples in a dataset as points in a metric space and compute distances to group together similar points. In this paper, we present a wholly different way of clustering points in 2-dimensional space, inspired by how humans cluster data: by training neural networks to perform instance segmentation on plotted data. Our approach, Visual Clustering, has several advantages over traditional clustering algorithms: it is much faster than most existing clustering algorithms (making it suitable for very large datasets), it agrees strongly with human intuition for clusters, and it is by default hyperparameter free (although additional steps with hyperparameters can be introduced for more control of the algorithm). We describe the method and compare it to ten other clustering methods on synthetic data to illustrate its advantages and disadvantages. We then demonstrate how our approach can be extended to higher dimensional data and illustrate its performance on real-world data. The implementation of Visual Clustering is publicly available and can be applied to any dataset in a few lines of code.

**Abstract:** Including covariant information, such as position, force, velocity or spin is important in many tasks in computational physics and chemistry. We introduce Steerable E(3) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (SEGNNs) that generalise equivariant graph networks, such that node and edge attributes are not restricted to invariant scalars, but can contain covariant information, such as vectors or tensors. This model, composed of steerable MLPs, is able to incorporate geometric and physical information in both the message and update functions. Through the definition of steerable node attributes, the MLPs provide a new class of activation functions for general use with steerable feature fields. We discuss ours and related work through the lens of equivariant non-linear convolutions, which further allows us to pin-point the successful components of SEGNNs: non-linear message aggregation improves upon classic linear (steerable) point convolutions; steerable messages improve upon recent equivariant graph networks that send invariant messages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several tasks in computational physics and chemistry and provide extensive ablation studies.

**Abstract:** Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful framework for guiding agents' actions in environments with stochastic rewards and unknown or noisy state dynamics. In many real-world settings, these agents must operate in multiple environments, each with slightly different dynamics. For example, we may be interested in developing policies to guide medical treatment for patients with and without a given disease, or policies to navigate curriculum design for students with and without a learning disability. Here, we introduce nested policy fitted Q-iteration (NFQI), an RL framework that finds optimal policies in environments that exhibit such a structure. Our approach develops a nested $Q$-value function that takes advantage of the shared structure between two groups of observations from two separate environments while allowing their policies to be distinct from one another. We find that NFQI yields policies that rely on relevant features and perform at least as well as a policy that does not consider group structure. We demonstrate NFQI's performance using an OpenAI Gym environment and a clinical decision making RL task. Our results suggest that NFQI can develop policies that are better suited to many real-world clinical environments.

**Abstract:** While recent progress has been made in text-to-image generation, text-to-shape generation remains a challenging problem due to the unavailability of paired text and shape data at a large scale. We present a simple yet effective method for zero-shot text-to-shape generation based on a two-stage training process, which only depends on an unlabelled shape dataset and a pre-trained image-text network such as CLIP. Our method not only demonstrates promising zero-shot generalization, but also avoids expensive inference time optimization and can generate multiple shapes for a given text.

**Abstract:** Recently, emotional speech synthesis has achieved remarkable performance. The emotion strength of synthesized speech can be controlled flexibly using a strength descriptor, which is obtained by an emotion attribute ranking function. However, a trained ranking function on specific data has poor generalization, which limits its applicability for more realistic cases. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based emotion strength assessment network for strength prediction that is referred to as StrengthNet. Our model conforms to a multi-task learning framework with a structure that includes an acoustic encoder, a strength predictor and an auxiliary emotion predictor. A data augmentation strategy was utilized to improve the model generalization. Experiments show that the predicted emotion strength of the proposed StrengthNet are highly correlated with ground truth scores for seen and unseen speech. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/ttslr/StrengthNet.

**Abstract:** We prove a lower bound on the excess risk of sparse interpolating procedures for linear regression with Gaussian data in the overparameterized regime. We apply this result to obtain a lower bound for basis pursuit (the minimum $\ell_1$-norm interpolant) that implies that its excess risk can converge at an exponentially slower rate than OLS (the minimum $\ell_2$-norm interpolant), even when the ground truth is sparse. Our analysis exposes the benefit of an effect analogous to the "wisdom of the crowd", except here the harm arising from fitting the $\textit{noise}$ is ameliorated by spreading it among many directions -- the variance reduction arises from a $\textit{foolish}$ crowd.

**Abstract:** Many model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods follow a similar template: fit a model to previously observed data, and then use data from that model for RL or planning. However, models that achieve better training performance (e.g., lower MSE) are not necessarily better for control: an RL agent may seek out the small fraction of states where an accurate model makes mistakes, or it might act in ways that do not expose the errors of an inaccurate model. As noted in prior work, there is an objective mismatch: models are useful if they yield good policies, but they are trained to maximize their accuracy, rather than the performance of the policies that result from them. In this work, we propose a single objective for jointly training the model and the policy, such that updates to either component increases a lower bound on expected return. This joint optimization mends the objective mismatch in prior work. Our objective is a global lower bound on expected return, and this bound becomes tight under certain assumptions. The resulting algorithm (MnM) is conceptually similar to a GAN: a classifier distinguishes between real and fake transitions, the model is updated to produce transitions that look realistic, and the policy is updated to avoid states where the model predictions are unrealistic.

**Abstract:** Intent detection is a crucial task in any Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system and forms the foundation of a task-oriented dialogue system. To build high-quality real-world conversational solutions for edge devices, there is a need for deploying intent detection model on device. This necessitates a light-weight, fast, and accurate model that can perform efficiently in a resource-constrained environment. To this end, we propose LIDSNet, a novel lightweight on-device intent detection model, which accurately predicts the message intent by utilizing a Deep Siamese Network for learning better sentence representations. We use character-level features to enrich the sentence-level representations and empirically demonstrate the advantage of transfer learning by utilizing pre-trained embeddings. Furthermore, to investigate the efficacy of the modules in our architecture, we conduct an ablation study and arrive at our optimal model. Experimental results prove that LIDSNet achieves state-of-the-art competitive accuracy of 98.00% and 95.97% on SNIPS and ATIS public datasets respectively, with under 0.59M parameters. We further benchmark LIDSNet against fine-tuned BERTs and show that our model is at least 41x lighter and 30x faster during inference than MobileBERT on Samsung Galaxy S20 device, justifying its efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices.

**Abstract:** Charting the baby connectome evolution trajectory during the first year after birth plays a vital role in understanding dynamic connectivity development of baby brains. Such analysis requires acquisition of longitudinal connectomic datasets. However, both neonatal and postnatal scans are rarely acquired due to various difficulties. A small body of works has focused on predicting baby brain evolution trajectory from a neonatal brain connectome derived from a single modality. Although promising, large training datasets are essential to boost model learning and to generalize to a multi-trajectory prediction from different modalities (i.e., functional and morphological connectomes). Here, we unprecedentedly explore the question: Can we design a few-shot learning-based framework for predicting brain graph trajectories across different modalities? To this aim, we propose a Graph Multi-Trajectory Evolution Network (GmTE-Net), which adopts a teacher-student paradigm where the teacher network learns on pure neonatal brain graphs and the student network learns on simulated brain graphs given a set of different timepoints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first teacher-student architecture tailored for brain graph multi-trajectory growth prediction that is based on few-shot learning and generalized to graph neural networks (GNNs). To boost the performance of the student network, we introduce a local topology-aware distillation loss that forces the predicted graph topology of the student network to be consistent with the teacher network. Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains over benchmark methods. Hence, our GmTE-Net can be leveraged to predict atypical brain connectivity trajectory evolution across various modalities. Our code is available at https: //github.com/basiralab/GmTE-Net.

**Abstract:** This paper presents novel Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) topologies to implement Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-like algorithms for automatic speech recognition. Three new CTC variants are proposed: (1) the "compact-CTC", in which direct transitions between units are replaced with <epsilon> back-off transitions; (2) the "minimal-CTC", that only adds <blank> self-loops when used in WFST-composition; and (3) "selfless-CTC", that disallows self-loop for non-blank units. The new CTC variants have several benefits, such as reducing decoding graph size and GPU memory required for training while keeping model accuracy.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) often rely on easy-to-learn discriminatory features, or cues, that are not necessarily essential to the problem at hand. For example, ducks in an image may be recognized based on their typical background scenery, such as lakes or streams. This phenomenon, also known as shortcut learning, is emerging as a key limitation of the current generation of machine learning models. In this work, we introduce a set of experiments to deepen our understanding of shortcut learning and its implications. We design a training setup with several shortcut cues, named WCST-ML, where each cue is equally conducive to the visual recognition problem at hand. Even under equal opportunities, we observe that (1) certain cues are preferred to others, (2) solutions biased to the easy-to-learn cues tend to converge to relatively flat minima on the loss surface, and (3) the solutions focusing on those preferred cues are far more abundant in the parameter space. We explain the abundance of certain cues via their Kolmogorov (descriptional) complexity: solutions corresponding to Kolmogorov-simple cues are abundant in the parameter space and are thus preferred by DNNs. Our studies are based on the synthetic dataset DSprites and the face dataset UTKFace. In our WCST-ML, we observe that the inborn bias of models leans toward simple cues, such as color and ethnicity. Our findings emphasize the importance of active human intervention to remove the inborn model biases that may cause negative societal impacts.

**Abstract:** With the successful creation of high-quality image-to-image (Img2Img) translation GANs comes the non-ethical applications of DeepFake and DeepNude. Such misuses of img2img techniques present a challenging problem for society. In this work, we tackle the problem by introducing the Limit-Aware Self-Guiding Gradient Sliding Attack (LaS-GSA). LaS-GSA follows the Nullifying Attack to cancel the img2img translation process under a black-box setting. In other words, by processing input images with the proposed LaS-GSA before publishing, any targeted img2img GANs can be nullified, preventing the model from maliciously manipulating the images. To improve efficiency, we introduce the limit-aware random gradient-free estimation and the gradient sliding mechanism to estimate the gradient that adheres to the adversarial limit, i.e., the pixel value limitations of the adversarial example. Theoretical justifications validate how the above techniques prevent inefficiency caused by the adversarial limit in both the direction and the step length. Furthermore, an effective self-guiding prior is extracted solely from the threat model and the target image to efficiently leverage the prior information and guide the gradient estimation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaS-GSA requires fewer queries to nullify the image translation process with higher success rates than 4 state-of-the-art black-box methods.

**Abstract:** Text-only adaptation of an end-to-end (E2E) model remains a challenging task for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Language model (LM) fusion-based approaches require an additional external LM during inference, significantly increasing the computation cost. To overcome this, we propose an internal LM adaptation (ILMA) of the E2E model using text-only data. Trained with audio-transcript pairs, an E2E model implicitly learns an internal LM that characterizes the token sequence probability which is approximated by the E2E model output after zeroing out the encoder contribution. During ILMA, we fine-tune the internal LM, i.e., the E2E components excluding the encoder, to minimize a cross-entropy loss. To make ILMA effective, it is essential to train the E2E model with an internal LM loss besides the standard E2E loss. Furthermore, we propose to regularize ILMA by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the adapted and unadapted internal LMs. ILMA is the most effective when we update only the last linear layer of the joint network. ILMA enables a fast text-only adaptation of the E2E model without increasing the run-time computational cost. Experimented with 30K-hour trained transformer transducer models, ILMA achieves up to 34.9% relative word error rate reduction from the unadapted baseline.

**Abstract:** Speech synthesis is used in a wide variety of industries. Nonetheless, it always sounds flat or robotic. The state of the art methods that allow for prosody control are very cumbersome to use and do not allow easy tuning. To tackle some of these drawbacks, in this work we target the implementation of a text-to-speech model where the inferred speech can be tuned with the desired emotions. To do so, we use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) together with a sequence-to-sequence model using an attention mechanism. We evaluate four different configurations considering different inputs and training strategies, study them and prove how our best model can generate speech files that lie in the same distribution as the initial training dataset. Additionally, a new strategy to boost the training convergence by applying a guided attention loss is proposed.

**Abstract:** Expert-layman text style transfer technologies have the potential to improve communication between members of scientific communities and the general public. High-quality information produced by experts is often filled with difficult jargon laypeople struggle to understand. This is a particularly notable issue in the medical domain, where layman are often confused by medical text online. At present, two bottlenecks interfere with the goal of building high-quality medical expert-layman style transfer systems: a dearth of pretrained medical-domain language models spanning both expert and layman terminologies and a lack of parallel corpora for training the transfer task itself. To mitigate the first issue, we propose a novel language model (LM) pretraining task, Knowledge Base Assimilation, to synthesize pretraining data from the edges of a graph of expert- and layman-style medical terminology terms into an LM during self-supervised learning. To mitigate the second issue, we build a large-scale parallel corpus in the medical expert-layman domain using a margin-based criterion. Our experiments show that transformer-based models pretrained on knowledge base assimilation and other well-established pretraining tasks fine-tuning on our new parallel corpus leads to considerable improvement against expert-layman transfer benchmarks, gaining an average relative improvement of our human evaluation, the Overall Success Rate (OSR), by 106%.

**Abstract:** In this work, we develop a method named Twinning, for partitioning a dataset into statistically similar twin sets. Twinning is based on SPlit, a recently proposed model-independent method for optimally splitting a dataset into training and testing sets. Twinning is orders of magnitude faster than the SPlit algorithm, which makes it applicable to Big Data problems such as data compression. Twinning can also be used for generating multiple splits of a given dataset to aid divide-and-conquer procedures and $k$-fold cross validation.

**Abstract:** Low-latency deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) have become a promising alternative to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) because of their potential for increased energy efficiency on event-driven neuromorphic hardware. Neural networks, including SNNs, however, are subject to various adversarial attacks and must be trained to remain resilient against such attacks for many applications. Nevertheless, due to prohibitively high training costs associated with SNNs, analysis, and optimization of deep SNNs under various adversarial attacks have been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first present a detailed analysis of the inherent robustness of low-latency SNNs against popular gradient-based attacks, namely fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and projected gradient descent (PGD). Motivated by this analysis, to harness the model robustness against these attacks we present an SNN training algorithm that uses crafted input noise and incurs no additional training time. To evaluate the merits of our algorithm, we conducted extensive experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Compared to standard trained direct input SNNs, our trained models yield improved classification accuracy of up to 13.7% and 10.1% on FGSM and PGD attack-generated images, respectively, with negligible loss in clean image accuracy. Our models also outperform inherently robust SNNs trained on rate-coded inputs with improved or similar classification performance on attack-generated images while having up to 25x and 4.6x lower latency and computation energy, respectively.

**Abstract:** Several brain disorders can be detected by observing alterations in the brain's structural and functional connectivities. Neurological findings suggest that early diagnosis of brain disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), can prevent and even reverse its development into Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, recent studies aimed to predict the evolution of brain connectivities over time by proposing machine learning models that work on brain images. However, such an approach is costly and time-consuming. Here, we propose to use brain connectivities as a more efficient alternative for time-dependent brain disorder diagnosis by regarding the brain as instead a large interconnected graph characterizing the interconnectivity scheme between several brain regions. We term our proposed method Recurrent Brain Graph Mapper (RBGM), a novel efficient edge-based recurrent graph neural network that predicts the time-dependent evaluation trajectory of a brain graph from a single baseline. Our RBGM contains a set of recurrent neural network-inspired mappers for each time point, where each mapper aims to project the ground-truth brain graph onto its next time point. We leverage the teacher forcing method to boost training and improve the evolved brain graph quality. To maintain the topological consistency between the predicted brain graphs and their corresponding ground-truth brain graphs at each time point, we further integrate a topological loss. We also use l1 loss to capture time-dependency and minimize the distance between the brain graph at consecutive time points for regularization. Benchmarks against several variants of RBGM and state-of-the-art methods prove that we can achieve the same accuracy in predicting brain graph evolution more efficiently, paving the way for novel graph neural network architecture and a highly efficient training scheme.

**Abstract:** Synthesizing multimodality medical data provides complementary knowledge and helps doctors make precise clinical decisions. Although promising, existing multimodal brain graph synthesis frameworks have several limitations. First, they mainly tackle only one problem (intra- or inter-modality), limiting their generalizability to synthesizing inter- and intra-modality simultaneously. Second, while few techniques work on super-resolving low-resolution brain graphs within a single modality (i.e., intra), inter-modality graph super-resolution remains unexplored though this would avoid the need for costly data collection and processing. More importantly, both target and source domains might have different distributions, which causes a domain fracture between them. To fill these gaps, we propose a multi-resolution StairwayGraphNet (SG-Net) framework to jointly infer a target graph modality based on a given modality and super-resolve brain graphs in both inter and intra domains. Our SG-Net is grounded in three main contributions: (i) predicting a target graph from a source one based on a novel graph generative adversarial network in both inter (e.g., morphological-functional) and intra (e.g., functional-functional) domains, (ii) generating high-resolution brain graphs without resorting to the time consuming and expensive MRI processing steps, and (iii) enforcing the source distribution to match that of the ground truth graphs using an inter-modality aligner to relax the loss function to optimize. Moreover, we design a new Ground Truth-Preserving loss function to guide both generators in learning the topological structure of ground truth brain graphs more accurately. Our comprehensive experiments on predicting target brain graphs from source graphs using a multi-resolution stairway showed the outperformance of our method in comparison with its variants and state-of-the-art method.

**Abstract:** In online markets, sellers can maliciously recapture others' images on display screens to utilize as spoof images, which can be challenging to distinguish in human eyes. To prevent such harm, we propose an anti-spoofing method using the paired rgb images and depth maps provided by the mobile camera with a Time-of-Fight sensor. When images are recaptured on display screens, various patterns differing by the screens as known as the moirÃ© patterns can be also captured in spoof images. These patterns lead the anti-spoofing model to be overfitted and unable to detect spoof images recaptured on unseen media. To avoid the issue, we build a novel representation model composed of two embedding models, which can be trained without considering the recaptured images. Also, we newly introduce mToF dataset, the largest and most diverse object anti-spoofing dataset, and the first to utilize ToF data. Experimental results confirm that our model achieves robust generalization even across unseen domains.

**Abstract:** Iron ore feed load control is one of the most critical settings in a mineral grinding process, directly impacting the quality of final products. The setting of the feed load is mainly determined by the characteristics of the ore pellets. However, the characterisation of ore is challenging to acquire in many production environments, leading to poor feed load settings and inefficient production processes. This paper presents our work using deep learning models for direct ore feed load estimation from ore pellet images. To address the challenges caused by the large size of a full ore pellets image and the shortage of accurately annotated data, we treat the whole modelling process as a weakly supervised learning problem. A two-stage model training algorithm and two neural network architectures are proposed. The experiment results show competitive model performance, and the trained models can be used for real-time feed load estimation for grind process optimisation.

**Abstract:** Accurate and automated super-resolution image synthesis is highly desired since it has the great potential to circumvent the need for acquiring high-cost medical scans and a time-consuming preprocessing pipeline of neuroimaging data. However, existing deep learning frameworks are solely designed to predict high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) one, which limits their generalization ability to brain graphs (i.e., connectomes). A small body of works has focused on superresolving brain graphs where the goal is to predict a HR graph from a single LR graph. Although promising, existing works mainly focus on superresolving graphs belonging to the same domain (e.g., functional), overlooking the domain fracture existing between multimodal brain data distributions (e.g., morphological and structural). To this aim, we propose a novel inter-domain adaptation framework namely, Learn to SuperResolve Brain Graphs with Knowledge Distillation Network (L2S-KDnet), which adopts a teacher-student paradigm to superresolve brain graphs. Our teacher network is a graph encoder-decoder that firstly learns the LR brain graph embeddings, and secondly learns how to align the resulting latent representations to the HR ground truth data distribution using an adversarial regularization. Ultimately, it decodes the HR graphs from the aligned embeddings. Next, our student network learns the knowledge of the aligned brain graphs as well as the topological structure of the predicted HR graphs transferred from the teacher. We further leverage the decoder of the teacher to optimize the student network. L2S-KDnet presents the first TS architecture tailored for brain graph super-resolution synthesis that is based on inter-domain alignment. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains over benchmark methods.

**Abstract:** Foreign Object Debris (FOD) detection has attracted increased attention in the area of machine learning and computer vision. However, a robust and publicly available image dataset for FOD has not been initialized. To this end, this paper introduces an image dataset of FOD, named FOD in Airports (FOD-A). FOD-A object categories have been selected based on guidance from prior documentation and related research by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In addition to the primary annotations of bounding boxes for object detection, FOD-A provides labeled environmental conditions. As such, each annotation instance is further categorized into three light level categories (bright, dim, and dark) and two weather categories (dry and wet). Currently, FOD-A has released 31 object categories and over 30,000 annotation instances. This paper presents the creation methodology, discusses the publicly available dataset extension process, and demonstrates the practicality of FOD-A with widely used machine learning models for object detection.

**Abstract:** Transfer Learning (TL) is an efficient machine learning paradigm that allows overcoming some of the hurdles that characterize the successful training of deep neural networks, ranging from long training times to the needs of large datasets. While exploiting TL is a well established and successful training practice in Supervised Learning (SL), its applicability in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is rarer. In this paper, we study the level of transferability of three different variants of Deep-Q Networks on popular DRL benchmarks as well as on a set of novel, carefully designed control tasks. Our results show that transferring neural networks in a DRL context can be particularly challenging and is a process which in most cases results in negative transfer. In the attempt of understanding why Deep-Q Networks transfer so poorly, we gain novel insights into the training dynamics that characterizes this family of algorithms.

Specifically, we apply coarse yet deliberate perturbations in the Gaussian prior space to induce desired behavior from the diffusion model, while applying masks and softening kernels to ensure that iterative edits are applied only to the target region. Listening tests demonstrate that EdiTTS is capable of reliably generating natural-sounding audio that satisfies user-imposed requirements.

**Abstract:** We propose a learning framework for graph kernels, which is theoretically grounded on regularizing optimal transport. This framework provides a novel optimal transport distance metric, namely Regularized Wasserstein (RW) discrepancy, which can preserve both features and structure of graphs via Wasserstein distances on features and their local variations, local barycenters and global connectivity. Two strongly convex regularization terms are introduced to improve the learning ability. One is to relax an optimal alignment between graphs to be a cluster-to-cluster mapping between their locally connected vertices, thereby preserving the local clustering structure of graphs. The other is to take into account node degree distributions in order to better preserve the global structure of graphs. We also design an efficient algorithm to enable a fast approximation for solving the optimization problem. Theoretically, our framework is robust and can guarantee the convergence and numerical stability in optimization. We have empirically validated our method using 12 datasets against 16 state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark databases for both graphs with discrete attributes and graphs with continuous attributes.

**Abstract:** Few-shot learning presents a challenging paradigm for training discriminative models on a few training samples representing the target classes to discriminate. However, classification methods based on deep learning are ill-suited for such learning as they need large amounts of training data --let alone one-shot learning. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been introduced to the field of network neuroscience, where the brain connectivity is encoded in a graph. However, with scarce neuroimaging datasets particularly for rare diseases and low-resource clinical facilities, such data-devouring architectures might fail in learning the target task. In this paper, we take a very different approach in training GNNs, where we aim to learn with one sample and achieve the best performance --a formidable challenge to tackle. Specifically, we present the first one-shot paradigm where a GNN is trained on a single population-driven template --namely a connectional brain template (CBT). A CBT is a compact representation of a population of brain graphs capturing the unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. It is analogous to brain image atlases for neuroimaging datasets. Using a one-representative CBT as a training sample, we alleviate the training load of GNN models while boosting their performance across a variety of classification and regression tasks. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperformed benchmark one-shot learning methods with downstream classification and time-dependent brain graph data forecasting tasks while competing with the train-on-all conventional training strategy.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have a clear degradation when applying to the unseen environment due to the covariate shift. Conventional approaches like domain adaptation requires the pre-collected target data for iterative training, which is impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose to adapt the deep models to the novel environment during inference. An previous solution is test time normalization, which substitutes the source statistics in BN layers with the target batch statistics. However, we show that test time normalization may potentially deteriorate the discriminative structures due to the mismatch between target batch statistics and source parameters. To this end, we present a general formulation $Î±$-BN to calibrate the batch statistics by mixing up the source and target statistics for both alleviating the domain shift and preserving the discriminative structures. Based on $Î±$-BN, we further present a novel loss function to form a unified test time adaptation framework Core, which performs the pairwise class correlation online optimization. Extensive experiments show that our approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance on total twelve datasets from three topics, including model robustness to corruptions, domain generalization on image classification and semantic segmentation. Particularly, our $Î±$-BN improves 28.4\% to 43.9\% on GTA5 $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes without any training, even outperforms the latest source-free domain adaptation method.

**Abstract:** Human shape estimation has become increasingly important both theoretically and practically, for instance, in 3D mesh estimation, distance garment production and computational forensics, to mention just a few examples. As a further specialization, \emph{Human Body Dimensions Estimation} (HBDE) focuses on estimating human body measurements like shoulder width or chest circumference from images or 3D meshes usually using supervised learning approaches. The main obstacle in this context is the data scarcity problem, as collecting this ground truth requires expensive and difficult procedures. This obstacle can be overcome by obtaining realistic human measurements from 3D human meshes. However, a) there are no well established methods to calculate HBDs from 3D meshes and b) there are no benchmarks to fairly compare results on the HBDE task. Our contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we present a method to calculate right and left arm length, shoulder width, and inseam (crotch height) from 3D meshes with focus on potential medical, virtual try-on and distance tailoring applications. On the other hand, we use four additional body dimensions calculated using recently published methods to assemble a set of eight body dimensions which we use as a supervision signal to our Neural Anthropometer: a convolutional neural network capable of estimating these dimensions. To assess the estimation, we train the Neural Anthropometer with synthetic images of 3D meshes, from which we calculated the HBDs and observed that the network's overall mean estimate error is $20.89$ mm (relative error of 2.84\%). The results we present are fully reproducible and establish a fair baseline for research on the task of HBDE, therefore enabling the community with a valuable method.

**Abstract:** Learning how to estimate a connectional brain template(CBT) from a population of brain multigraphs, where each graph (e.g., functional) quantifies a particular relationship between pairs of brain regions of interest (ROIs), allows to pin down the unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. Specifically, a CBT is viewed as an integral representation of a set of highly heterogeneous graphs and ideally meeting the centeredness (i.e., minimum distance to all graphs in the population) and discriminativeness (i.e., distinguishes the healthy from the disordered population) criteria. So far, existing works have been limited to only integrating and fusing a population of brain multigraphs acquired at a single timepoint. In this paper, we unprecedentedly tackle the question: Given a baseline multigraph population, can we learn how to integrate and forecast its CBT representations at follow-up timepoints? Addressing such question is of paramount in predicting common alternations across healthy and disordered populations. To fill this gap, we propose Recurrent Multigraph Integrator Network (ReMI-Net), the first graph recurrent neural network which infers the baseline CBT of an input population t1 and predicts its longitudinal evolution over time (ti > t1). Our ReMI-Net is composed of recurrent neural blocks with graph convolutional layers using a cross-node message passing to first learn hidden-states embeddings of each CBT node (i.e., brain region of interest) and then predict its evolution at the consecutive timepoint. Moreover, we design a novel time-dependent loss to regularize the CBT evolution trajectory over time and further introduce a cyclic recursion and learnable normalization layer to generate well-centered CBTs from time-dependent hidden-state embeddings. Finally, we derive the CBT adjacency matrix from the learned hidden state graph representation.

**Abstract:** In recent years, Procedural Level Generation via Machine Learning (PLGML) techniques have been applied to generate game levels with machine learning. These approaches rely on human-annotated representations of game levels. Creating annotated datasets for games requires domain knowledge and is time-consuming. Hence, though a large number of video games exist, annotated datasets are curated only for a small handful. Thus current PLGML techniques have been explored in limited domains, with Super Mario Bros. as the most common example. To address this problem, we present tile embeddings, a unified, affordance-rich representation for tile-based 2D games. To learn this embedding, we employ autoencoders trained on the visual and semantic information of tiles from a set of existing, human-annotated games. We evaluate this representation on its ability to predict affordances for unseen tiles, and to serve as a PLGML representation for annotated and unannotated games.

However, acquiring quality annotations is expensive on human resources and usually requires domain expertise. On the other hand, medical reports contain a plethora of information both about pneumonia characteristics and its location. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised attention-driven deep learning model that leverages encoded information in medical reports during training to facilitate better localization. Our model also performs classification of attributes that are associated to pneumonia and extracted from medical reports for supervision. Both the classification and localization are trained in conjunction and once trained, the model can be utilized for both the localization and characterization of pneumonia using only the input image. In this paper, we explore and analyze the model using chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the introduction of textual information improves pneumonia localization. We showcase quantitative results on two datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Chest X-ray-8, and we also showcase severity characterization on the COVID-19 dataset.

**Abstract:** Multimodal Language Analysis is a demanding area of research, since it is associated with two requirements: combining different modalities and capturing temporal information. During the last years, several works have been proposed in the area, mostly centered around supervised learning in downstream tasks. In this paper we propose extracting unsupervised Multimodal Language representations that are universal and can be applied to different tasks. Towards this end, we map the word-level aligned multimodal sequences to 2-D matrices and then use Convolutional Autoencoders to learn embeddings by combining multiple datasets. Extensive experimentation on Sentiment Analysis (MOSEI) and Emotion Recognition (IEMOCAP) indicate that the learned representations can achieve near-state-of-the-art performance with just the use of a Logistic Regression algorithm for downstream classification. It is also shown that our method is extremely lightweight and can be easily generalized to other tasks and unseen data with small performance drop and almost the same number of parameters. The proposed multimodal representation models are open-sourced and will help grow the applicability of Multimodal Language.

**Abstract:** We study unsupervised data selection for semi-supervised learning (SSL), where a large-scale unlabeled data is available and a small subset of data is budgeted for label acquisition. Existing SSL methods focus on learning a model that effectively integrates information from given small labeled data and large unlabeled data, whereas we focus on selecting the right data for SSL without any label or task information, in an also stark contrast to supervised data selection for active learning. Intuitively, instances to be labeled shall collectively have maximum diversity and coverage for downstream tasks, and individually have maximum information propagation utility for SSL. We formalize these concepts in a three-step data-centric SSL method that improves FixMatch in stability and accuracy by 8% on CIFAR-10 (0.08% labeled) and 14% on ImageNet-1K (0.2% labeled). Our work demonstrates that a small compute spent on careful labeled data selection brings big annotation efficiency and model performance gain without changing the learning pipeline. Our completely unsupervised data selection can be easily extended to other weakly supervised learning settings.

**Abstract:** This paper provides a novel framework that learns canonical embeddings for non-rigid shape matching. In contrast to prior work in this direction, our framework is trained end-to-end and thus avoids instabilities and constraints associated with the commonly-used Laplace-Beltrami basis or sequential optimization schemes. On multiple datasets, we demonstrate that learning self symmetry maps with a deep functional map projects 3D shapes into a low dimensional canonical embedding that facilitates non-rigid shape correspondence via a simple nearest neighbor search. Our framework outperforms multiple recent learning based methods on FAUST and SHREC benchmarks while being computationally cheaper, data-efficient, and robust.

**Abstract:** The connection between Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes gained a lot of attention in the last few years. Hidden units are proven to follow a Gaussian process limit when the layer width tends to infinity. Recent work has suggested that finite Bayesian neural networks may outperform their infinite counterparts because they adapt their internal representations flexibly. To establish solid ground for future research on finite-width neural networks, our goal is to study the prior induced on hidden units. Our main result is an accurate description of hidden units tails which shows that unit priors become heavier-tailed going deeper, thanks to the introduced notion of generalized Weibull-tail. This finding sheds light on the behavior of hidden units of finite Bayesian neural networks.

**Abstract:** Learning good representations on multi-relational graphs is essential to knowledge base completion (KBC). In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised training objective for multi-relational graph representation learning, via simply incorporating relation prediction into the commonly used 1vsAll objective. The new training objective contains not only terms for predicting the subject and object of a given triple, but also a term for predicting the relation type. We analyse how this new objective impacts multi-relational learning in KBC: experiments on a variety of datasets and models show that relation prediction can significantly improve entity ranking, the most widely used evaluation task for KBC, yielding a 6.1% increase in MRR and 9.9% increase in Hits@1 on FB15k-237 as well as a 3.1% increase in MRR and 3.4% in Hits@1 on Aristo-v4. Moreover, we observe that the proposed objective is especially effective on highly multi-relational datasets, i.e. datasets with a large number of predicates, and generates better representations when larger embedding sizes are used.

**Abstract:** The implicit bias of neural networks has been extensively studied in recent years. Lyu and Li [2019] showed that in homogeneous networks trained with the exponential or the logistic loss, gradient flow converges to a KKT point of the max margin problem in the parameter space. However, that leaves open the question of whether this point will generally be an actual optimum of the max margin problem. In this paper, we study this question in detail, for several neural network architectures involving linear and ReLU activations. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that in many cases, the KKT point is not even a local optimum of the max margin problem. On the flip side, we identify multiple settings where a local or global optimum can be guaranteed. Finally, we answer a question posed in Lyu and Li [2019] by showing that for non-homogeneous networks, the normalized margin may strictly decrease over time.

**Abstract:** When several limited power devices are available, one of the most efficient ways to make profit of these resources, while reducing the processing latency and communication load, is to run in parallel several neural sub-networks and to fuse the result at the end of processing. However, such a combination of sub-networks must be trained specifically for each particular configuration of devices (characterized by number of devices and their capacities) which may vary over different model deployments and even within the same deployment. In this work we introduce parallelly distributable slimmable (ParaDiS) neural networks that are splittable in parallel among various device configurations without retraining. While inspired by slimmable networks allowing instant adaptation to resources on just one device, ParaDiS networks consist of several multi-device distributable configurations or switches that strongly share the parameters between them. We evaluate ParaDiS framework on MobileNet v1 and ResNet-50 architectures on ImageNet classification task and WDSR architecture for image super-resolution task. We show that ParaDiS switches achieve similar or  better accuracy than the individual models, i.e., distributed models of the same structure trained individually. Moreover, we show that, as compared to universally slimmable networks that are not distributable, the accuracy of distributable ParaDiS switches either does not drop at all or drops by a maximum of 1 % only in the worst cases. Finally, once distributed over several devices, ParaDiS outperforms greatly slimmable models.

**Abstract:** Network-valued data are encountered in a wide range of applications and pose challenges in learning due to their complex structure and absence of vertex correspondence. Typical examples of such problems include classification or grouping of protein structures and social networks. Various methods, ranging from graph kernels to graph neural networks, have been proposed that achieve some success in graph classification problems. However, most methods have limited theoretical justification, and their applicability beyond classification remains unexplored. In this work, we propose methods for clustering multiple graphs, without vertex correspondence, that are inspired by the recent literature on estimating graphons -- symmetric functions corresponding to infinite vertex limit of graphs. We propose a novel graph distance based on sorting-and-smoothing graphon estimators. Using the proposed graph distance, we present two clustering algorithms and show that they achieve state-of-the-art results. We prove the statistical consistency of both algorithms under Lipschitz assumptions on the graph degrees. We further study the applicability of the proposed distance for graph two-sample testing problems.

**Abstract:** Multi-modal word semantics aims to enhance embeddings with perceptual input, assuming that human meaning representation is grounded in sensory experience. Most research focuses on evaluation involving direct visual input, however, visual grounding can contribute to linguistic applications as well. Another motivation for this paper is the growing need for more interpretable models and for evaluating model efficiency regarding size and performance. This work explores the impact of visual information for semantics when the evaluation involves no direct visual input, specifically semantic similarity and relatedness. We investigate a new embedding type in-between linguistic and visual modalities, based on the structured annotations of Visual Genome. We compare uni- and multi-modal models including structured, linguistic and image based representations. We measure the efficiency of each model with regard to data and model size, modality / data distribution and information gain. The analysis includes an interpretation of embedding structures. We found that this new embedding conveys complementary information for text based embeddings. It achieves comparable performance in an economic way, using orders of magnitude less resources than visual models.

**Abstract:** Cluster visualization is an essential task for nonlinear dimensionality reduction as a data analysis tool. It is often believed that Student t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) can show clusters for well clusterable data, with a smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence corresponding to a better quality. There was even theoretical proof for the guarantee of this property. However, we point out that this is not necessarily the case -- t-SNE may leave clustering patterns hidden despite strong signals present in the data. Extensive empirical evidence is provided to support our claim. First, several real-world counter-examples are presented, where t-SNE fails even if the input neighborhoods are well clusterable. Tuning hyperparameters in t-SNE or using better optimization algorithms does not help solve this issue because a better t-SNE learning objective can correspond to a worse cluster embedding. Second, we check the assumptions in the clustering guarantee of t-SNE and find they are often violated for real-world data sets.

**Abstract:** A recommender system learns to predict the user-specific preference or intention over many items simultaneously for all users, making personalized recommendations based on a relatively small number of observations. One central issue is how to leverage three-way interactions, referred to as user-item-stage dependencies on a monotonic chain of events, to enhance the prediction accuracy. A monotonic chain of events occurs, for instance, in an article sharing dataset, where a ``follow'' action implies a ``like'' action, which in turn implies a ``view'' action. In this article, we develop a multistage recommender system utilizing a two-level monotonic property characterizing a monotonic chain of events for personalized prediction. Particularly, we derive a large-margin classifier based on a nonnegative additive latent factor model in the presence of a high percentage of missing observations, particularly between stages, reducing the number of model parameters for personalized prediction while guaranteeing prediction consistency. On this ground, we derive a regularized cost function to learn user-specific behaviors at different stages, linking decision functions to numerical and categorical covariates to model user-item-stage interactions. Computationally, we derive an algorithm based on blockwise coordinate descent. Theoretically, we show that the two-level monotonic property enhances the accuracy of learning as compared to a standard method treating each stage individually and an ordinal method utilizing only one-level monotonicity. Finally, the proposed method compares favorably with existing methods in simulations and an article sharing dataset.

**Abstract:** Real world tournaments are almost always intransitive. Recent works have noted that parametric models which assume $d$ dimensional node representations can effectively model intransitive tournaments. However, nothing is known about the structure of the class of tournaments that arise out of any fixed $d$ dimensional representations. In this work, we develop a novel theory for understanding parametric tournament representations. Our first contribution is to structurally characterize the class of tournaments that arise out of $d$ dimensional representations. We do this by showing that these tournament classes have forbidden configurations which must necessarily be union of flip classes, a novel way to partition the set of all tournaments. We further characterise rank $2$ tournaments completely by showing that the associated forbidden flip class contains just $2$ tournaments. Specifically, we show that the rank $2$ tournaments are equivalent to locally-transitive tournaments. This insight allows us to show that the minimum feedback arc set problem on this tournament class can be solved using the standard Quicksort procedure. For a general rank $d$ tournament class, we show that the flip class associated with a coned-doubly regular tournament of size $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$ must be a forbidden configuration. To answer a dual question, using a celebrated result of \cite{forster}, we show a lower bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ on the minimum dimension needed to represent all tournaments on $n$ nodes. For any given tournament, we show a novel upper bound on the smallest representation dimension that depends on the least size of the number of unique nodes in any feedback arc set of the flip class associated with a tournament. We show how our results also shed light on upper bound of sign-rank of matrices.

**Abstract:** Depth estimation-based obstacle avoidance has been widely adopted by autonomous systems (drones and vehicles) for safety purpose. It normally relies on a stereo camera to automatically detect obstacles and make flying/driving decisions, e.g., stopping several meters ahead of the obstacle in the path or moving away from the detected obstacle. In this paper, we explore new security risks associated with the stereo vision-based depth estimation algorithms used for obstacle avoidance. By exploiting the weaknesses of the stereo matching in depth estimation algorithms and the lens flare effect in optical imaging, we propose DoubleStar, a long-range attack that injects fake obstacle depth by projecting pure light from two complementary light sources.
  DoubleStar includes two distinctive attack formats: beams attack and orbs attack, which leverage projected light beams and lens flare orbs respectively to cause false depth perception. We successfully attack two commercial stereo cameras designed for autonomous systems (ZED and Intel RealSense). The visualization of fake depth perceived by the stereo cameras illustrates the false stereo matching induced by DoubleStar. We further use Ardupilot to simulate the attack and demonstrate its impact on drones. To validate the attack on real systems, we perform a real-world attack towards a commercial drone equipped with state-of-the-art obstacle avoidance algorithms. Our attack can continuously bring a flying drone to a sudden stop or drift it away across a long distance under various lighting conditions, even bypassing sensor fusion mechanisms. Specifically, our experimental results show that DoubleStar creates fake depth up to 15 meters in distance at night and up to 8 meters during the daytime. To mitigate this newly discovered threat, we provide discussions on potential countermeasures to defend against DoubleStar.

**Abstract:** Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often achieve astounding performances, but may potentially result in severe generalization error. Recently, the relation between the sharpness of the loss landscape and the generalization error has been established by Foret et al. (2020), in which the Sharpness Aware Minimizer (SAM) was proposed to mitigate the degradation of the generalization. Unfortunately, SAM s computational cost is roughly double that of base optimizers, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This paper thus proposes Efficient Sharpness Aware Minimizer (ESAM), which boosts SAM s efficiency at no cost to its generalization performance. ESAM includes two novel and efficient training strategies-StochasticWeight Perturbation and Sharpness-Sensitive Data Selection. In the former, the sharpness measure is approximated by perturbing a stochastically chosen set of weights in each iteration; in the latter, the SAM loss is optimized using only a judiciously selected subset of data that is sensitive to the sharpness. We provide theoretical explanations as to why these strategies perform well. We also show, via extensive experiments on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, that ESAM enhances the efficiency over SAM from requiring 100% extra computations to 40% vis-a-vis base optimizers, while test accuracies are preserved or even improved.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a generic framework for the numerical simulation of transformation-diffusion processes in complex volume geometric shapes. This work follows a previous one devoted to the simulation of microbial degradation of organic matter in porous system at microscopic scale. We generalized and improved the MOSAIC method significantly and thus yielding a much more generic and efficient numerical simulation scheme. In particular, regarding the simulation of diffusion processes from the graph, in this study we proposed a completely explicit and semi-implicit numerical scheme that can significantly reduce the computational complexity. We validated our method by comparing the results to the one provided by classical Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) within the context of microbial decomposition simulation. For the same datasets, we obtained similar results in a significantly shorter computing time (i.e., 10-15 minutes) than the prior work (several hours). Besides the classical LBM method takes around 3 weeks computing time.

**Abstract:** In contrast to object recognition models, humans do not blindly trust their perception when building representations of the world, instead recruiting metacognition to detect percepts that are unreliable or false, such as when we realize that we mistook one object for another. We propose METAGEN, an unsupervised model that enhances object recognition models through a metacognition. Given noisy output from an object-detection model, METAGEN learns a meta-representation of how its perceptual system works and uses it to infer the objects in the world responsible for the detections. METAGEN achieves this by conditioning its inference on basic principles of objects that even human infants understand (known as Spelke principles: object permanence, cohesion, and spatiotemporal continuity). We test METAGEN on a variety of state-of-the-art object detection neural networks. We find that METAGEN quickly learns an accurate metacognitive representation of the neural network, and that this improves detection accuracy by filling in objects that the detection model missed and removing hallucinated objects. This approach enables generalization to out-of-sample data and outperforms comparison models that lack a metacognition.

**Abstract:** In this work, a novel idea is presented for combinatorial optimization problems, a hybrid network, which results in a superior outcome. We applied this method to graph pointer networks [1], expanding its capabilities to a higher level. We proposed a hybrid pointer network (HPN) to solve the travelling salesman problem trained by reinforcement learning. Furthermore, HPN builds upon graph pointer networks which is an extension of pointer networks with an additional graph embedding layer. HPN outperforms the graph pointer network in solution quality due to the hybrid encoder, which provides our model with a verity encoding type, allowing our model to converge to a better policy. Our network significantly outperforms the original graph pointer network for small and large-scale problems increasing its performance for TSP50 from 5.959 to 5.706 without utilizing 2opt, Pointer networks, Attention model, and a wide range of models, producing results comparable to highly tuned and specialized algorithms. We make our data, models, and code publicly available [2].

**Abstract:** Popular approaches for quantifying predictive uncertainty in deep neural networks often involve a set of weights or models, for instance via ensembling or Monte Carlo Dropout. These techniques usually produce overhead by having to train multiple model instances or do not produce very diverse predictions. This survey aims to familiarize the reader with an alternative class of models based on the concept of Evidential Deep Learning: For unfamiliar data, they admit "what they don't know" and fall back onto a prior belief. Furthermore, they allow uncertainty estimation in a single model and forward pass by parameterizing distributions over distributions. This survey recapitulates existing works, focusing on the implementation in a classification setting. Finally, we survey the application of the same paradigm to regression problems. We also provide a reflection on the strengths and weaknesses of the mentioned approaches compared to existing ones and provide the most central theoretical results in order to inform future research.

**Abstract:** Many causal and policy effects of interest are defined by linear functionals of high-dimensional or non-parametric regression functions. $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal estimation of the object of interest requires debiasing to reduce the effects of regularization and/or model selection on the object of interest. Debiasing is typically achieved by adding a correction term to the plug-in estimator of the functional, that is derived based on a functional-specific theoretical derivation of what is known as the influence function and which leads to properties such as double robustness and Neyman orthogonality. We instead implement an automatic debiasing procedure based on automatically learning the Riesz representation of the linear functional using Neural Nets and Random Forests. Our method solely requires value query oracle access to the linear functional. We propose a multi-tasking Neural Net debiasing method with stochastic gradient descent minimization of a combined Riesz representer and regression loss, while sharing representation layers for the two functions. We also propose a Random Forest method which learns a locally linear representation of the Riesz function. Even though our methodology applies to arbitrary functionals, we experimentally find that it beats state of the art performance of the prior neural net based estimator of Shi et al. (2019) for the case of the average treatment effect functional. We also evaluate our method on the more challenging problem of estimating average marginal effects with continuous treatments, using semi-synthetic data of gasoline price changes on gasoline demand.

**Abstract:** Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in developed countries, especially in people over 60 years of age. The workload of specialists and the healthcare system in this field has increased in recent years mainly dues to three reasons: 1) increased use of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technique, 2) prevalence of population aging worldwide, and 3) chronic nature of AMD. Recent developments in deep learning have provided a unique opportunity for the development of fully automated diagnosis frameworks. Considering the presence of AMD-related retinal pathologies in varying sizes in OCT images, our objective was to propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of distinguishing pathologies using receptive fields with various sizes. The multi-scale CNN was designed based on the feature pyramid network (FPN) structure and was used to diagnose normal and two common clinical characteristics of dry and wet AMD, namely drusen and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The proposed method was evaluated on a national dataset gathered at Noor Eye Hospital (NEH), consisting of 12649 retinal OCT images from 441 patients, and a UCSD public dataset, consisting of 108312 OCT images. The results show that the multi-scale FPN-based structure was able to improve the base model's overall accuracy by 0.4% to 3.3% for different backbone models. In addition, gradual learning improved the performance in two phases from 87.2%+-2.5% to 93.4%+-1.4% by pre-training the base model on ImageNet weights in the first phase and fine-tuning the resulting model on a dataset of OCT images in the second phase. The promising quantitative and qualitative results of the proposed architecture prove the suitability of the proposed method to be used as a screening tool in healthcare centers assisting ophthalmologists in making better diagnostic decisions.

**Abstract:** Federated learning allows collaborative workers to solve a machine learning problem while preserving data privacy. Recent studies have tackled various challenges in federated learning, but the joint optimization of communication overhead, learning reliability, and deployment efficiency is still an open problem. To this end, we propose a new scheme named federated learning via plurality vote (FedVote). In each communication round of FedVote, workers transmit binary or ternary weights to the server with low communication overhead. The model parameters are aggregated via weighted voting to enhance the resilience against Byzantine attacks. When deployed for inference, the model with binary or ternary weights is resource-friendly to edge devices. We show that our proposed method can reduce quantization error and converges faster compared with the methods directly quantizing the model updates.

We study this phenomenon with mean-field analysis, by translating the training process of ResNet to a gradient-flow partial differential equation (PDE) and examining the convergence properties of this limiting process. The activation function is assumed to be $2$-homogeneous or partially $1$-homogeneous; the regularized ReLU satisfies the latter condition. We show that if the ResNet is sufficiently large, with depth and width depending algebraically on the accuracy and confidence levels, first-order optimization methods can find global minimizers that fit the training data.

**Abstract:** Exploration is a crucial aspect of bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms. The uncertainty quantification necessary for exploration often comes from either closed-form expressions based on simple models or resampling and posterior approximations that are computationally intensive. We propose instead an approximate exploration methodology based on fitting only two point estimates, one tuned and one overfit. The approach, which we term the residual overfit method of exploration (ROME), drives exploration towards actions where the overfit model exhibits the most overfitting compared to the tuned model. The intuition is that overfitting occurs the most at actions and contexts with insufficient data to form accurate predictions of the reward. We justify this intuition formally from both a frequentist and a Bayesian information theoretic perspective. The result is a method that generalizes to a wide variety of models and avoids the computational overhead of resampling or posterior approximations. We compare ROME against a set of established contextual bandit methods on three datasets and find it to be one of the best performing.

**Abstract:** Capsule networks (CapsNets) are an emerging trend in image processing. In contrast to a convolutional neural network, CapsNets are not vulnerable to object deformation, as the relative spatial information of the objects is preserved across the network. However, their complexity is mainly related with the capsule structure and the dynamic routing mechanism, which makes it almost unreasonable to deploy a CapsNet, in its original form, in a resource-constrained device powered by a small microcontroller (MCU). In an era where intelligence is rapidly shifting from the cloud to the edge, this high complexity imposes serious challenges to the adoption of CapsNets at the very edge. To tackle this issue, we present an API for the execution of quantized CapsNets in Cortex-M and RISC-V MCUs. Our software kernels extend the Arm CMSIS-NN and RISC-V PULP-NN, to support capsule operations with 8-bit integers as operands. Along with it, we propose a framework to perform post training quantization of a CapsNet. Results show a reduction in memory footprint of almost 75%, with a maximum accuracy loss of 1%. In terms of throughput, our software kernels for the Arm Cortex-M are, at least, 5.70x faster than a pre-quantized CapsNet running on an NVIDIA GTX 980 Ti graphics card. For RISC-V, the throughout gain increases to 26.28x and 56.91x for a single- and octa-core configuration, respectively.

**Abstract:** Word embeddings are a fixed, distributional representation of the context of words in a corpus learned from word co-occurrences. Despite their proven utility in machine learning tasks, word embedding models may capture uneven semantic and syntactic representations, and can inadvertently reflect various kinds of bias present within corpora upon which they were trained. It has been demonstrated that post-processing of word embeddings to apply information found in lexical dictionaries can improve the semantic associations, thus improving their quality. Building on this idea, we propose a system that incorporates an adaptation of word embedding post-processing, which we call "interactive refitting", to address some of the most daunting qualitative problems found in word embeddings. Our approach allows a human to identify and address potential quality issues with word embeddings interactively. This has the advantage of negating the question of who decides what constitutes bias or what other quality issues may affect downstream tasks. It allows each organization or entity to address concerns they may have at a fine grained level and to do so in an iterative and interactive fashion. It also allows for better insight into what effect word embeddings, and refinements to word embeddings, have on machine learning pipelines.

**Abstract:** Biological spiking neural networks (SNNs) can temporally encode information in their outputs, e.g. in the rank order in which neurons fire, whereas artificial neural networks (ANNs) conventionally do not. As a result, models of SNNs for neuromorphic computing are regarded as potentially more rapid and efficient than ANNs when dealing with temporal input. On the other hand, ANNs are simpler to train, and usually achieve superior performance. Here we show that temporal coding such as rank coding (RC) inspired by SNNs can also be applied to conventional ANNs such as LSTMs, and leads to computational savings and speedups. In our RC for ANNs, we apply backpropagation through time using the standard real-valued activations, but only from a strategically early time step of each sequential input example, decided by a threshold-crossing event. Learning then incorporates naturally also _when_ to produce an output, without other changes to the model or the algorithm. Both the forward and the backward training pass can be significantly shortened by skipping the remaining input sequence after that first event. RC-training also significantly reduces time-to-insight during inference, with a minimal decrease in accuracy. The desired speed-accuracy trade-off is tunable by varying the threshold or a regularization parameter that rewards output entropy. We demonstrate these in two toy problems of sequence classification, and in a temporally-encoded MNIST dataset where our RC model achieves 99.19% accuracy after the first input time-step, outperforming the state of the art in temporal coding with SNNs, as well as in spoken-word classification of Google Speech Commands, outperforming non-RC-trained early inference with LSTMs.

**Abstract:** We find that different Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained with the same dataset share a common principal subspace in latent spaces, no matter in which architectures (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Preceptors (MLPs) and Autoencoders (AEs)) the DNNs were built or even whether labels have been used in training (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised learning). Specifically, we design a new metric $\mathcal{P}$-vector to represent the principal subspace of deep features learned in a DNN, and propose to measure angles between the principal subspaces using $\mathcal{P}$-vectors. Small angles (with cosine close to $1.0$) have been found in the comparisons between any two DNNs trained with different algorithms/architectures. Furthermore, during the training procedure from random scratch, the angle decrease from a larger one ($70^\circ-80^\circ$ usually) to the small one, which coincides the progress of feature space learning from scratch to convergence. Then, we carry out case studies to measure the angle between the $\mathcal{P}$-vector and the principal subspace of training dataset, and connect such angle with generalization performance. Extensive experiments with practically-used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs), AEs and CNNs for classification, image reconstruction, and self-supervised learning tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets have been done to support our claims with solid evidences.

**Abstract:** Plant breeding programs extensively monitor the evolution of seed kernels for seed certification, wherein lies the need to appropriately label the seed kernels by type and quality. However, the breeding environments are large where the monitoring of seed kernels can be challenging due to the minuscule size of seed kernels. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles aids in seed monitoring and labeling since they can capture images at low altitudes whilst being able to access even the remotest areas in the environment. A key bottleneck in the labeling of seeds using UAV imagery is drone altitude i.e. the classification accuracy decreases as the altitude increases due to lower image detail. Convolutional neural networks are a great tool for multi-class image classification when there is a training dataset that closely represents the different scenarios that the network might encounter during evaluation. The article addresses the challenge of training data creation using Domain Randomization wherein synthetic image datasets are generated from a meager sample of seeds captured by the bottom camera of an autonomously driven Parrot AR Drone 2.0. Besides, the article proposes a seed classification framework as a proof-of-concept using the convolutional neural networks of Microsoft's ResNet-100, Oxford's VGG-16, and VGG-19. To enhance the classification accuracy of the framework, an ensemble model is developed resulting in an overall accuracy of 94.6%.

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto gold standard in computer vision applications in the past years. Recently, however, new model architectures have been proposed challenging the status quo. The Vision Transformer (ViT) relies solely on attention modules, while the MLP-Mixer architecture substitutes the self-attention modules with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Despite their great success, CNNs have been widely known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, causing serious concerns for security-sensitive applications. Thus, it is critical for the community to know whether the newly proposed ViT and MLP-Mixer are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To this end, we empirically evaluate their adversarial robustness under several adversarial attack setups and benchmark them against the widely used CNNs. Overall, we find that the two architectures, especially ViT, are more robust than their CNN models. Using a toy example, we also provide empirical evidence that the lower adversarial robustness of CNNs can be partially attributed to their shift-invariant property. Our frequency analysis suggests that the most robust ViT architectures tend to rely more on low-frequency features compared with CNNs. Additionally, we have an intriguing finding that MLP-Mixer is extremely vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations.

**Abstract:** Neural collapse is a highly symmetric geometric pattern of neural networks that emerges during the terminal phase of training, with profound implications on the generalization performance and robustness of the trained networks. To understand how the last-layer features and classifiers exhibit this recently discovered implicit bias, in this paper, we introduce a surrogate model called the unconstrained layer-peeled model (ULPM). We prove that gradient flow on this model converges to critical points of a minimum-norm separation problem exhibiting neural collapse in its global minimizer. Moreover, we show that the ULPM with the cross-entropy loss has a benign global landscape for its loss function, which allows us to prove that all the critical points are strict saddle points except the global minimizers that exhibit the neural collapse phenomenon. Empirically, we show that our results also hold during the training of neural networks in real-world tasks when explicit regularization or weight decay is not used.

**Abstract:** We propose a relative entropy gradient sampler (REGS) for sampling from unnormalized distributions. REGS is a particle method that seeks a sequence of simple nonlinear transforms iteratively pushing the initial samples from a reference distribution into the samples from an unnormalized target distribution. To determine the nonlinear transforms at each iteration, we consider the Wasserstein gradient flow of relative entropy. This gradient flow determines a path of probability distributions that interpolates the reference distribution and the target distribution. It is characterized by an ODE system with velocity fields depending on the density ratios of the density of evolving particles and the unnormalized target density. To sample with REGS, we need to estimate the density ratios and simulate the ODE system with particle evolution. We propose a novel nonparametric approach to estimating the logarithmic density ratio using neural networks. Extensive simulation studies on challenging multimodal 1D and 2D mixture distributions and Bayesian logistic regression on real datasets demonstrate that the REGS outperforms the state-of-the-art sampling methods included in the comparison.

**Abstract:** In the regression problem, we consider the problem of estimating the variance function by the means of aggregation methods. We focus on two particular aggregation setting: Model Selection aggregation (MS) and Convex aggregation (C) where the goal is to select the best candidate and to build the best convex combination of candidates respectively among a collection of candidates. In both cases, the construction of the estimator relies on a two-step procedure and requires two independent samples. The first step exploits the first sample to build the candidate estimators for the variance function by the residual-based method and then the second dataset is used to perform the aggregation step. We show the consistency of the proposed method with respect to the L 2error both for MS and C aggregations. We evaluate the performance of these two methods in the heteroscedastic model and illustrate their interest in the regression problem with reject option.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel modification of the standard upper confidence bound (UCB) method for the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem which tunes the confidence bound of a given bandit based on its distance to others. Our UCB distance tuning (UCB-DT) formulation enables improved performance as measured by expected regret by preventing the MAB algorithm from focusing on non-optimal bandits which is a well-known deficiency of standard UCB. "Distance tuning" of the standard UCB is done using a proposed distance measure, which we call bandit distance, that is parameterizable and which therefore can be optimized to control the transition rate from exploration to exploitation based on problem requirements. We empirically demonstrate increased performance of UCB-DT versus many existing state-of-the-art methods which use the UCB formulation for the MAB problem. Our contribution also includes the development of a conceptual tool called the "Exploration Bargain Point" which gives insights into the tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation. We argue that the Exploration Bargain Point provides an intuitive perspective that is useful for comparatively analyzing the performance of UCB-based methods.

**Abstract:** While building convolutional network-based systems, the toll it takes to train the network is something that cannot be ignored. In cases where we need to append additional capabilities to the existing model, the attention immediately goes towards retraining techniques. In this paper, I show how to leverage knowledge about the dataset to append the class faster while maintaining the speed of inference as well as the accuracies; while reducing the amount of time and data required. The method can extend a class in the existing object detection model in 1/10th of the time compared to the other existing methods. S-Extension patch not only offers faster training but also speed and ease of adaptation, as it can be appended to any existing system, given it fulfills the similarity threshold condition.

**Abstract:** Tissue awareness has a great demand to improve surgical accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. In arthroscopy, it is one of the challenging tasks due to surgical sites exhibit limited features and textures. Moreover, arthroscopic surgical video shows high intra-class variations. Arthroscopic videos are recorded with endoscope known as arthroscope which records tissue structures at proximity, therefore, frames contain minimal joint structure. As consequences, fully conventional network-based segmentation model suffers from long- and short- term dependency problems. In this study, we present a densely connected shape aware multi-scale segmentation model which captures multi-scale features and integrates shape features to achieve tissue-tool segmentations. The model has been evaluated with three distinct datasets. Moreover, with the publicly available polyp dataset our proposed model achieved 5.09 % accuracy improvement.

**Abstract:** Diffusion-based inpainting is a powerful tool for the reconstruction of images from sparse data. Its quality strongly depends on the choice of known data. Optimising their spatial location -- the inpainting mask -- is challenging. A commonly used tool for this task are stochastic optimisation strategies. However, they are slow as they compute multiple inpainting results. We provide a remedy in terms of a learned mask generation model. By emulating the complete inpainting pipeline with two networks for mask generation and neural surrogate inpainting, we obtain a model for highly efficient adaptive mask generation. Experiments indicate that our model can achieve competitive quality with an acceleration by as much as four orders of magnitude. Our findings serve as a basis for making diffusion-based inpainting more attractive for various applications such as image compression, where fast encoding is highly desirable.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of training a classification model with group annotated training data. Recent work has established that, if there is distribution shift across different groups, models trained using the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) objective suffer from poor performance on minority groups and that group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) objective is a better alternative. The starting point of this paper is the observation that though Group-DRO performs better than ERM on minority groups for some benchmark datasets, there are several other datasets where it performs much worse than ERM. Inspired by ideas from the closely related problem of domain generalization, this paper proposes a new and simple algorithm that explicitly encourages learning of features that are shared across various groups. The key insight behind our proposed algorithm is that while Group-DRO focuses on groups with worst regularized loss, focusing instead, on groups that enable better performance even on other groups, could lead to learning of shared/common features, thereby enhancing minority performance beyond what is achieved by Group-DRO. Empirically, we show that our proposed algorithm matches or achieves better performance compared to strong contemporary baselines including ERM and Group-DRO on standard benchmarks on both minority groups and across all groups. Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithm is a descent method and finds first order stationary points of smooth nonconvex functions.

**Abstract:** Uncertainty estimation in deep learning has recently emerged as a crucial area of interest to advance reliability and robustness in safety-critical applications. While there have been many proposed methods that either focus on distance-aware model uncertainties for out-of-distribution detection or on input-dependent label uncertainties for in-distribution calibration, both of these types of uncertainty are often necessary. In this work, we propose the HetSNGP method for jointly modeling the model and data uncertainty. We show that our proposed model affords a favorable combination between these two complementary types of uncertainty and thus outperforms the baseline methods on some challenging out-of-distribution datasets, including CIFAR-100C, Imagenet-C, and Imagenet-A. Moreover, we propose HetSNGP Ensemble, an ensembled version of our method which adds an additional type of uncertainty and also outperforms other ensemble baselines.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in the area of computer vision. The disparity estimation problem tends to be addressed by DNNs which achieve much better prediction accuracy than traditional hand-crafted feature-based methods. However, the existing DNNs hardly serve both efficient computation and rich expression capability, which makes them difficult for deployment in real-time and high-quality applications, especially on mobile devices. To this end, we propose an efficient, accurate, and configurable deep network for disparity estimation named FADNet++. Leveraging several liberal network design and training techniques, FADNet++ can boost its accuracy with a fast model inference speed for real-time applications. Besides, it enables users to easily configure different sizes of models for balancing accuracy and inference efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of FADNet++ on both synthetic and realistic datasets among six GPU devices varying from server to mobile platforms. Experimental results show that FADNet++ and its variants achieve state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, and run at a significant order of magnitude faster speed than existing 3D models. With the constraint of running at above 15 frames per second (FPS) on a mobile GPU, FADNet++ achieves a new state-of-the-art result for the SceneFlow dataset.

**Abstract:** Cross-domain object detection is more challenging than object classification since multiple objects exist in an image and the location of each object is unknown in the unlabeled target domain. As a result, when we adapt features of different objects to enhance the transferability of the detector, the features of the foreground and the background are easy to be confused, which may hurt the discriminability of the detector. Besides, previous methods focused on category adaptation but ignored another important part for object detection, i.e., the adaptation on bounding box regression. To this end, we propose D-adapt, namely Decoupled Adaptation, to decouple the adversarial adaptation and the training of the detector. Besides, we fill the blank of regression domain adaptation in object detection by introducing a bounding box adaptor. Experiments show that D-adapt achieves state-of-the-art results on four cross-domain object detection tasks and yields 17% and 21% relative improvement on benchmark datasets Clipart1k and Comic2k in particular.

**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer has become a prevailing deep architecture for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs). However, it is less effective in learning improvement models for VRP because its positional encoding (PE) method is not suitable in representing VRP solutions. This paper presents a novel Dual-Aspect Collaborative Transformer (DACT) to learn embeddings for the node and positional features separately, instead of fusing them together as done in existing ones, so as to avoid potential noises and incompatible correlations. Moreover, the positional features are embedded through a novel cyclic positional encoding (CPE) method to allow Transformer to effectively capture the circularity and symmetry of VRP solutions (i.e., cyclic sequences). We train DACT using Proximal Policy Optimization and design a curriculum learning strategy for better sample efficiency. We apply DACT to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). Results show that our DACT outperforms existing Transformer based improvement models, and exhibits much better generalization performance across different problem sizes on synthetic and benchmark instances, respectively.

**Abstract:** Learning accurate classifiers for novel categories from very few examples, known as few-shot image classification, is a challenging task in statistical machine learning and computer vision. The performance in few-shot classification suffers from the bias in the estimation of classifier parameters; however, an effective underlying bias reduction technique that could alleviate this issue in training few-shot classifiers has been overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias reduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction removes the first order term $O(N^{-1})$ from the small-sample bias of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Here we show that the general Firth bias reduction technique simplifies to encouraging uniform class assignment probabilities for multinomial logistic classification, and almost has the same effect in cosine classifiers. We derive the optimization objective for Firth penalized multinomial logistic and cosine classifiers, and empirically evaluate that it is consistently effective across the board for few-shot image classification, regardless of (1) the feature representations from different backbones, (2) the number of samples per class, and (3) the number of classes. Finally, we show the robustness of Firth bias reduction, in the case of imbalanced data distribution. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ehsansaleh/firth_bias_reduction

**Abstract:** The increasing number of wireless devices operating in unlicensed spectrum motivates the development of intelligent adaptive approaches to spectrum access that go beyond traditional carrier sensing. We develop a novel distributed implementation of a policy gradient method known as Proximal Policy Optimization modelled on a two stage Markov decision process that enables such an intelligent approach, and still achieves decentralized contention-based medium access. In each time slot, a base station (BS) uses information from spectrum sensing and reception quality to autonomously decide whether or not to transmit on a given resource, with the goal of maximizing proportional fairness network-wide. Empirically, we find the proportional fairness reward accumulated by the policy gradient approach to be significantly higher than even a genie-aided adaptive energy detection threshold. This is further validated by the improved sum and maximum user throughputs achieved by our approach.

**Abstract:** Traditional process mining considers only one single case notion and discovers and analyzes models based on this. However, a single case notion is often not a realistic assumption in practice. Multiple case notions might interact and influence each other in a process. Object-centric process mining introduces the techniques and concepts to handle multiple case notions. So far, such event logs have been standardized and novel process model discovery techniques were proposed. However, notions for evaluating the quality of a model are missing. These are necessary to enable future research on improving object-centric discovery and providing an objective evaluation of model quality. In this paper, we introduce a notion for the precision and fitness of an object-centric Petri net with respect to an object-centric event log. We give a formal definition and accompany this with an example. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to calculate these quality measures. We discuss our precision and fitness notion based on an event log with different models. Our precision and fitness notions are an appropriate way to generalize quality measures to the object-centric setting since we are able to consider multiple case notions, their dependencies and their interactions.

**Abstract:** Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is an unsupervised learning algorithm inspired by the features of the neocortex that can be used to continuously process stream data and detect anomalies, without requiring a large amount of data for training nor requiring labeled data. HTM is also able to continuously learn from samples, providing a model that is always up-to-date with respect to observations. These characteristics make HTM particularly suitable for supporting online failure prediction in cloud systems, which are systems with a dynamically changing behavior that must be monitored to anticipate problems. This paper presents the first systematic study that assesses HTM in the context of failure prediction. The results that we obtained considering 72 configurations of HTM applied to 12 different types of faults introduced in the Clearwater cloud system show that HTM can help to predict failures with sufficient effectiveness (F-measure = 0.76), representing an interesting practical alternative to (semi-)supervised algorithms.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a novel neural-based exploration strategy in contextual bandits, EE-Net, quite different from the standard UCB-based and TS-based approaches. Contextual multi-armed bandits have been studied for decades with various applications. To solve the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in bandits, there are three main techniques: epsilon-greedy, Thompson Sampling (TS), and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). In recent literature, linear contextual bandits have adopted ridge regression to estimate the reward function and combine it with TS or UCB strategies for exploration. However, this line of works explicitly assumes the reward is based on a linear function of arm vectors, which may not be true in real-world datasets. To overcome this challenge, a series of neural-based bandit algorithms have been proposed, where a neural network is assigned to learn the underlying reward function and TS or UCB are adapted for exploration. In this paper, we propose "EE-Net", a neural-based bandit approach with a novel exploration strategy. In addition to utilizing a neural network (Exploitation network) to learn the reward function, EE-Net adopts another neural network (Exploration network) to adaptively learn potential gains compared to currently estimated reward for making explorations. Then, a decision-maker is constructed to combine the outputs from the Exploitation and Exploration networks. We prove that EE-Net can achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log T})$ regret, which is tighter than existing state-of-the-art neural bandit algorithms ($\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T}\log T)$ for both UCB-based and TS-based). Through extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, we show that EE-Net outperforms existing linear and neural bandit approaches.

**Abstract:** Detection of common events and scenes from audio is useful for extracting and understanding human contexts in daily life. Prior studies have shown that leveraging knowledge from a relevant domain is beneficial for a target acoustic event detection (AED) process. Inspired by the observation that many human-centered acoustic events in daily life involve voice elements, this paper investigates the potential of transferring high-level voice representations extracted from a public speaker dataset to enrich an AED pipeline. Towards this end, we develop a dual-branch neural network architecture for the joint learning of voice and acoustic features during an AED process and conduct thorough empirical studies to examine the performance on the public AudioSet [1] with different types of inputs. Our main observations are that: 1) Joint learning of audio and voice inputs improves the AED performance (mean average precision) for both a CNN baseline (0.292 vs 0.134 mAP) and a TALNet [2] baseline (0.361 vs 0.351 mAP); 2) Augmenting the extra voice features is critical to maximize the model performance with dual inputs.

**Abstract:** In contrast to single-objective optimization (SOO), multi-objective optimization (MOO) requires an optimizer to find the Pareto frontier, a subset of feasible solutions that are not dominated by other feasible solutions. In this paper, we propose LaMOO, a novel multi-objective optimizer that learns a model from observed samples to partition the search space and then focus on promising regions that are likely to contain a subset of the Pareto frontier. The partitioning is based on the dominance number, which measures "how close" a data point is to the Pareto frontier among existing samples. To account for possible partition errors due to limited samples and model mismatch, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to exploit promising regions while exploring suboptimal regions that may turn out to contain good solutions later. Theoretically, we prove the efficacy of learning space partitioning via LaMOO under certain assumptions. Empirically, on the HyperVolume (HV) benchmark, a popular MOO metric, LaMOO substantially outperforms strong baselines on multiple real-world MOO tasks, by up to 225% in sample efficiency for neural architecture search on Nasbench201, and up to 10% for molecular design.

**Abstract:** Assemblies are patterns of coordinated firing across large populations of neurons, believed to represent higher-level information in the brain, such as memories, concepts, words, and other cognitive categories. Recently, a computational system called the Assembly Calculus (AC) has been proposed, based on a set of biologically plausible operations on assemblies. This system is capable of simulating arbitrary space-bounded computation, and describes quite naturally complex cognitive phenomena such as language. However, the question of whether assemblies can perform the brain's greatest trick -- its ability to learn -- has been open. We show that the AC provides a mechanism for learning to classify samples from well-separated classes. We prove rigorously that for simple classification problems, a new assembly that represents each class can be reliably formed in response to a few stimuli from it; this assembly is henceforth reliably recalled in response to new stimuli from the same class. Furthermore, such class assemblies will be distinguishable as long as the respective classes are reasonably separated, in particular when they are clusters of similar assemblies, or more generally divided by a halfspace with margin. Experimentally, we demonstrate the successful formation of assemblies which represent concept classes on synthetic data drawn from these distributions, and also on MNIST, which lends itself to classification through one assembly per digit. Seen as a learning algorithm, this mechanism is entirely online, generalizes from very few samples, and requires only mild supervision -- all key attributes of learning in a model of the brain.

**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning is used to train policies in scenarios where real-time access to the environment is expensive or impossible. As a natural consequence of these harsh conditions, an agent may lack the resources to fully observe the online environment before taking an action. We dub this situation the resource-constrained setting. This leads to situations where the offline dataset (available for training) can contain fully processed features (using powerful language models, image models, complex sensors, etc.) which are not available when actions are actually taken online. This disconnect leads to an interesting and unexplored problem in offline RL: Is it possible to use a richly processed offline dataset to train a policy which has access to fewer features in the online environment? In this work, we introduce and formalize this novel resource-constrained problem setting. We highlight the performance gap between policies trained using the full offline dataset and policies trained using limited features. We address this performance gap with a policy transfer algorithm which first trains a teacher agent using the offline dataset where features are fully available, and then transfers this knowledge to a student agent that only uses the resource-constrained features. To better capture the challenge of this setting, we propose a data collection procedure: Resource Constrained-Datasets for RL (RC-D4RL). We evaluate our transfer algorithm on RC-D4RL and the popular D4RL benchmarks and observe consistent improvement over the baseline (TD3+BC without transfer).

<p>

**Abstract:** The solution of multistage stochastic linear problems (MSLP) represents a challenge for many applications. Long-term hydrothermal dispatch planning (LHDP) materializes this challenge in a real-world problem that affects electricity markets, economies, and natural resources worldwide. No closed-form solutions are available for MSLP and the definition of non-anticipative policies with high-quality out-of-sample performance is crucial. Linear decision rules (LDR) provide an interesting simulation-based framework for finding high-quality policies to MSLP through two-stage stochastic models. In practical applications, however, the number of parameters to be estimated when using an LDR may be close or higher than the number of scenarios, thereby generating an in-sample overfit and poor performances in out-of-sample simulations. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization scheme for LDR based on the AdaLASSO (adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). The goal is to use the parsimony principle as largely studied in high-dimensional linear regression models to obtain better out-of-sample performance for an LDR applied to MSLP. Computational experiments show that the overfit threat is non-negligible when using the classical non-regularized LDR to solve MSLP. For the LHDP problem, our analysis highlights the following benefits of the proposed framework in comparison to the non-regularized benchmark: 1) significant reductions in the number of non-zero coefficients (model parsimony), 2) substantial cost reductions in out-of-sample evaluations, and 3) improved spot-price profiles.

<p>

**Abstract:** Here, we show that the robust overfitting shall be viewed as the early part of an epoch-wise double descent -- the robust test error will start to decrease again after training the model for a considerable number of epochs. Inspired by our observations, we further advance the analyses of double descent to understand robust overfitting better. In standard training, double descent has been shown to be a result of label flipping noise. However, this reasoning is not applicable in our setting, since adversarial perturbations are believed not to change the label. Going beyond label flipping noise, we propose to measure the mismatch between the assigned and (unknown) true label distributions, denoted as \emph{implicit label noise}. We show that the traditional labeling of adversarial examples inherited from their clean counterparts will lead to implicit label noise. Towards better labeling, we show that predicted distribution from a classifier, after scaling and interpolation, can provably reduce the implicit label noise under mild assumptions. In light of our analyses, we tailored the training objective accordingly to effectively mitigate the double descent and verified its effectiveness on three benchmark datasets.

**Abstract:** Adversarial training, as one of the few certified defenses against adversarial attacks, can be quite complicated and time-consuming, while the results might not be robust enough. To address the issue of lack of robustness, ensemble methods were proposed, aiming to get the final output by weighting the selected results from repeatedly trained processes. It is proved to be very useful in achieving robust and accurate results, but the computational and memory costs are even higher. Snapshot ensemble, a new ensemble method that combines several local minima in a single training process to make the final prediction, was proposed recently, which reduces the time spent on training multiple networks and the memory to store the results. Based on the snapshot ensemble, we present a new method that is easier to implement: unlike original snapshot ensemble that seeks for local minima, our snapshot ensemble focuses on the last few iterations of a training and stores the sets of parameters from them. Our algorithm is much simpler but the results are no less accurate than the original ones: based on different hyperparameters and datasets, our snapshot ensemble has shown a 5% to 30% increase in accuracy when compared to the traditional adversarial training.

**Abstract:** Watershed models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) consist of high-dimensional physical and empirical parameters. These parameters need to be accurately calibrated for models to produce reliable predictions for streamflow, evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent, and nutrient loading. Existing parameter estimation methods are time-consuming, inefficient, and computationally intensive, with reduced accuracy when estimating high-dimensional parameters. In this paper, we present a fast, accurate, and reliable methodology to calibrate the SWAT model (i.e., 21 parameters) using deep learning (DL). We develop DL-enabled inverse models based on convolutional neural networks to ingest streamflow data and estimate the SWAT model parameters. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to identify the optimal neural network architecture and the nine next best candidates. We use ensemble SWAT simulations to train, validate, and test the above DL models. We estimated the actual parameters of the SWAT model using observational data. We test and validate the proposed DL methodology on the American River Watershed, located in the Pacific Northwest-based Yakima River basin. Our results show that the DL models-based calibration is better than traditional parameter estimation methods, such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). The behavioral parameter sets estimated by DL have narrower ranges than GLUE and produce values within the sampling range even under high relative observational errors. This narrow range of parameters shows the reliability of the proposed workflow to estimate sensitive parameters accurately even under noise. Due to its fast and reasonably accurate estimations of process parameters, the proposed DL workflow is attractive for calibrating integrated hydrologic models for large spatial-scale applications.

**Abstract:** For many inference problems in statistics and econometrics, the unknown parameter is identified by a set of moment conditions. A generic method of solving moment conditions is the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). However, classical GMM estimation is potentially very sensitive to outliers. Robustified GMM estimators have been developed in the past, but suffer from several drawbacks: computational intractability, poor dimension-dependence, and no quantitative recovery guarantees in the presence of a constant fraction of outliers. In this work, we develop the first computationally efficient GMM estimator (under intuitive assumptions) that can tolerate a constant $Îµ$ fraction of adversarially corrupted samples, and that has an $\ell_2$ recovery guarantee of $O(\sqrtÎµ)$. To achieve this, we draw upon and extend a recent line of work on algorithmic robust statistics for related but simpler problems such as mean estimation, linear regression and stochastic optimization. As two examples of the generality of our algorithm, we show how our estimation algorithm and assumptions apply to instrumental variables linear and logistic regression. Moreover, we experimentally validate that our estimator outperforms classical IV regression and two-stage Huber regression on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets with corruption.

**Abstract:** Machine Learning models are deployed across a wide range of industries, performing a wide range of tasks. Tracking these models and ensuring they behave appropriately is becoming increasingly difficult as the number of deployed models increases. There are also new regulatory burdens for ML systems which affect human lives, requiring a link between a model and its training data in high-risk situations. Current ML monitoring systems often provide provenance and experiment tracking as a layer on top of an ML library, allowing room for imperfect tracking and skew between the tracked object and the metadata. In this paper we introduce Tribuo, a Java ML library that integrates model training, inference, strong type-safety, runtime checking, and automatic provenance recording into a single framework. All Tribuo's models and evaluations record the full processing pipeline for input data, along with the training algorithms, hyperparameters and data transformation steps automatically. The provenance lives inside the model object and can be persisted separately using common markup formats. Tribuo implements many popular ML algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, multi-label classification and anomaly detection, along with interfaces to XGBoost, TensorFlow and ONNX Runtime. Tribuo's source code is available at https://github.com/oracle/tribuo under an Apache 2.0 license with documentation and tutorials available at https://tribuo.org.

**Abstract:** Multiclass logistic regression is a fundamental task in machine learning with applications in classification and boosting. Previous work (Foster et al., 2018) has highlighted the importance of improper predictors for achieving "fast rates" in the online multiclass logistic regression problem without suffering exponentially from secondary problem parameters, such as the norm of the predictors in the comparison class. While Foster et al. (2018) introduced a statistically optimal algorithm, it is in practice computationally intractable due to its run-time complexity being a large polynomial in the time horizon and dimension of input feature vectors. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, FOLKLORE, for the problem which runs significantly faster than the algorithm of Foster et al.(2018) -- the running time per iteration scales quadratically in the dimension -- at the cost of a linear dependence on the norm of the predictors in the regret bound. This yields the first practical algorithm for online multiclass logistic regression, resolving an open problem of Foster et al.(2018). Furthermore, we show that our algorithm can be applied to online bandit multiclass prediction and online multiclass boosting, yielding more practical algorithms for both problems compared to the ones in Foster et al.(2018) with similar performance guarantees. Finally, we also provide an online-to-batch conversion result for our algorithm.

**Abstract:** In power systems, one wishes to regulate the aggregate demand of an ensemble of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as controllable loads and battery energy storage systems. We suggest a notion of predictability and fairness, which suggests that the long-term averages of prices or incentives offered should be independent of the initial states of the operators of the DER, the aggregator, and the power grid. We show that this notion cannot be guaranteed with many traditional controllers used by the load aggregator, including the usual proportional-integral (PI) controller. We show that even considering the non-linearity of the alternating-current model, this notion of predictability and fairness can be guaranteed for incrementally input-to-state stable (iISS) controllers, under mild assumptions.

**Abstract:** In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in learning from graph-structured data. With the growing tendency of graph nodes and edges, GCN training by single processor cannot meet the demand for time and memory, which led to a boom into distributed GCN training frameworks research. However, existing distributed GCN training frameworks require enormous communication costs between processors since multitudes of dependent nodes and edges information need to be collected and transmitted for GCN training from other processors. To address this issue, we propose a Graph Augmentation based Distributed GCN framework(GAD). In particular, GAD has two main components, GAD-Partition and GAD-Optimizer. We first propose a graph augmentation-based partition (GAD-Partition) that can divide original graph into augmented subgraphs to reduce communication by selecting and storing as few significant nodes of other processors as possible while guaranteeing the accuracy of the training. In addition, we further design a subgraph variance-based importance calculation formula and propose a novel weighted global consensus method, collectively referred to as GAD-Optimizer. This optimizer adaptively reduces the importance of subgraphs with large variances for the purpose of reducing the effect of extra variance introduced by GAD-Partition on distributed GCN training. Extensive experiments on four large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces the communication overhead (50%), improves the convergence speed (2X) of distributed GCN training, and slight gain in accuracy (0.45%) based on minimal redundancy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Federated learning systems that jointly preserve Byzantine robustness and privacy have remained an open problem. Robust aggregation, the standard defense for Byzantine attacks, generally requires server access to individual updates or nonlinear computation -- thus is incompatible with privacy-preserving methods such as secure aggregation via multiparty computation. To this end, we propose SHARE (Secure Hierarchical Robust Aggregation), a distributed learning framework designed to cryptographically preserve client update privacy and robustness to Byzantine adversaries simultaneously. The key idea is to incorporate secure averaging among randomly clustered clients before filtering malicious updates through robust aggregation. Experiments show that SHARE has similar robustness guarantees as existing techniques while enhancing privacy.

**Abstract:** Automatic identification of proper image frames at the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) frames during the review of invasive coronary angiograms (ICA) is important to assess blood flow during a cardiac cycle, reconstruct the 3D arterial anatomy from bi-planar views, and generate the complementary fusion map with myocardial images. The current identification method primarily relies on visual interpretation, making it not only time-consuming but also less reproducible. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically identify angiographic image frames associated with the ED and ES cardiac phases by using the trajectories of key vessel points (i.e. landmarks). More specifically, a detection algorithm is first used to detect the key points of coronary arteries, and then an optical flow method is employed to track the trajectories of the selected key points. The ED and ES frames are identified based on all these trajectories. Our method was tested with 62 ICA videos from two separate medical centers (22 and 9 patients in sites 1 and 2, respectively). Comparing consensus interpretations by two human expert readers, excellent agreement was achieved by the proposed algorithm: the agreement rates within a one-frame range were 92.99% and 92.73% for the automatic identification of the ED and ES image frames, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed automated method showed great potential for being an integral part of automated ICA image analysis.

**Abstract:** Recent work applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve traveling salesman problems (TSP) has shown that DRL-based solvers can be fast and competitive with TSP heuristics for small instances, but do not generalize well to larger instances. In this work, we propose a novel approach named MAGIC that includes a deep learning architecture and a DRL training method. Our architecture, which integrates a multilayer perceptron, a graph neural network, and an attention model, defines a stochastic policy that sequentially generates a TSP solution. Our training method includes several innovations: (1) we interleave DRL policy gradient updates with local search (using a new local search technique), (2) we use a novel simple baseline, and (3) we apply curriculum learning. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that MAGIC is superior to other DRL-based methods on random TSP instances, both in terms of performance and generalizability. Moreover, our method compares favorably against TSP heuristics and other state-of-the-art approach in terms of performance and computational time.

**Abstract:** Scientific applications that involve simulation ensembles can be accelerated greatly by using experiment design methods to select the best simulations to perform. Methods that use machine learning (ML) to create proxy models of simulations show particular promise for guiding ensembles but are challenging to deploy because of the need to coordinate dynamic mixes of simulation and learning tasks. We present Colmena, an open-source Python framework that allows users to steer campaigns by providing just the implementations of individual tasks plus the logic used to choose which tasks to execute when. Colmena handles task dispatch, results collation, ML model invocation, and ML model (re)training, using Parsl to execute tasks on HPC systems. We describe the design of Colmena and illustrate its capabilities by applying it to electrolyte design, where it both scales to 65536 CPUs and accelerates the discovery rate for high-performance molecules by a factor of 100 over unguided searches.

**Abstract:** Prehensile object rearrangement in cluttered and confined spaces has broad applications but is also challenging. For instance, rearranging products in a grocery or home shelf means that the robot cannot directly access all objects and has limited free space. This is harder than tabletop rearrangement where objects are easily accessible with top-down grasps, which simplifies robot-object interactions. This work focuses on problems where such interactions are critical for completing tasks and extends state-of-the-art results in rearrangement planning. It proposes a new efficient and complete solver under general constraints for monotone instances, which can be solved by moving each object at most once. The monotone solver reasons about robot-object constraints and uses them to effectively prune the search space. The new monotone solver is integrated with a global planner to solve non-monotone instances with high-quality solutions fast. Furthermore, this work contributes an effective pre-processing tool to speed up arm motion planning for rearrangement in confined spaces. The pre-processing tool provide significant speed-ups (49.1% faster on average) in online query resolution. Comparisons in simulations further demonstrate that the proposed monotone solver, equipped with the pre-processing tool, results in 57.3% faster computation and 3 times higher success rate than alternatives. Similarly, the resulting global planner is computationally more efficient and has a higher success rate given the more powerful monotone solver and the pre-processing tool, while producing high-quality solutions for non-monotone instances (i.e., only 1.3 buffers are needed on average).

  In this paper we propose a principled approach to shaping rewards for reinforcement learning from multiple objectives that are given as a partially-ordered set of signal-temporal-logic (STL) rules. To this end, we first equip STL with a novel quantitative semantics allowing to automatically evaluate individual requirements. We then develop a method for systematically combining evaluations of multiple requirements into a single reward that takes into account the priorities defined by the partial order. We finally evaluate our approach on several case studies, demonstrating its practical applicability.

**Abstract:** As a scalable data-driven approach, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made remarkable advances in solving the cooperative residential load scheduling problems. However, the common centralized training strategy of MARL algorithms raises privacy risks for involved households. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving multi-agent actor-critic framework where the decentralized actors are trained with distributed critics, such that both the decentralized execution and the distributed training do not require the global state information. The proposed framework can preserve the privacy of the households while simultaneously learn the multi-agent credit assignment mechanism implicitly. The simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the existing privacy-preserving actor-critic framework, and can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art actor-critic framework without privacy constraints.

**Abstract:** Over the last year, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants have highlighted the importance of screening tools with high diagnostic accuracy for new illnesses such as COVID-19. To that regard, deep learning approaches have proven as effective solutions for pneumonia classification, especially when considering chest-x-rays images. However, this lung infection can also be caused by other viral, bacterial or fungi pathogens. Consequently, efforts are being poured toward distinguishing the infection source to help clinicians to diagnose the correct disease origin. Following this tendency, this study further explores the effectiveness of established neural network architectures on the pneumonia classification task through the transfer learning paradigm. To present a comprehensive comparison, 12 well-known ImageNet pre-trained models were fine-tuned and used to discriminate among chest-x-rays of healthy people, and those showing pneumonia symptoms derived from either a viral (i.e., generic or SARS-CoV-2) or bacterial source. Furthermore, since a common public collection distinguishing between such categories is currently not available, two distinct datasets of chest-x-rays images, describing the aforementioned sources, were combined and employed to evaluate the various architectures. The experiments were performed using a total of 6330 images split between train, validation and test sets. For all models, common classification metrics were computed (e.g., precision, f1-score) and most architectures obtained significant performances, reaching, among the others, up to 84.46% average f1-score when discriminating the 4 identified classes. Moreover, confusion matrices and activation maps computed via the Grad-CAM algorithm were also reported to present an informed discussion on the networks classifications.

**Abstract:** Improving existing neural network architectures can involve several design choices such as manipulating the loss functions, employing a diverse learning strategy, exploiting gradient evolution at training time, optimizing the network hyper-parameters, or increasing the architecture depth. The latter approach is a straightforward solution, since it directly enhances the representation capabilities of a network; however, the increased depth generally incurs in the well-known vanishing gradient problem. In this paper, borrowing from different methods addressing this issue, we introduce an interlaced multi-task learning strategy, defined SIRe, to reduce the vanishing gradient in relation to the object classification task. The presented methodology directly improves a convolutional neural network (CNN) by enforcing the input image structure preservation through interlaced auto-encoders, and further refines the base network architecture by means of skip and residual connections. To validate the presented methodology, a simple CNN and various implementations of famous networks are extended via the SIRe strategy and extensively tested on the CIFAR100 dataset; where the SIRe-extended architectures achieve significantly increased performances across all models, thus confirming the presented approach effectiveness.

**Abstract:** A more realistic object detection paradigm, Open-World Object Detection, has arisen increasing research interests in the community recently. A qualified open-world object detector can not only identify objects of known categories, but also discover unknown objects, and incrementally learn to categorize them when their annotations progressively arrive. Previous works rely on independent modules to recognize unknown categories and perform incremental learning, respectively. In this paper, we provide a unified perspective: Semantic Topology. During the life-long learning of an open-world object detector, all object instances from the same category are assigned to their corresponding pre-defined node in the semantic topology, including the `unknown' category. This constraint builds up discriminative feature representations and consistent relationships among objects, thus enabling the detector to distinguish unknown objects out of the known categories, as well as making learned features of known objects undistorted when learning new categories incrementally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that semantic topology, either randomly-generated or derived from a well-trained language model, could outperform the current state-of-the-art open-world object detectors by a large margin, e.g., the absolute open-set error is reduced from 7832 to 2546, exhibiting the inherent superiority of semantic topology on open-world object detection.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces, for the first time to our knowledge, physics-informed neural networks to accurately estimate the AC-OPF result and delivers rigorous guarantees about their performance. Power system operators, along with several other actors, are increasingly using Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithms for a wide number of applications, including planning and real-time operations. However, in its original form, the AC Optimal Power Flow problem is often challenging to solve as it is non-linear and non-convex. Besides the large number of approximations and relaxations, recent efforts have also been focusing on Machine Learning approaches, especially neural networks. So far, however, these approaches have only partially considered the wide number of physical models available during training. And, more importantly, they have offered no guarantees about potential constraint violations of their output. Our approach (i) introduces the AC power flow equations inside neural network training and (ii) integrates methods that rigorously determine and reduce the worst-case constraint violations across the entire input domain, while maintaining the optimality of the prediction. We demonstrate how physics-informed neural networks achieve higher accuracy and lower constraint violations than standard neural networks, and show how we can further reduce the worst-case violations for all neural networks.

**Abstract:** As compared to using randomly generated sensing matrices, optimizing the sensing matrix w.r.t. a carefully designed criterion is known to lead to better quality signal recovery given a set of compressive measurements. In this paper, we propose generalizations of the well-known mutual coherence criterion for optimizing sensing matrices starting from random initial conditions. We term these generalizations as bi-coherence or tri-coherence and they are based on a criterion that discourages any one column of the sensing matrix from being close to a sparse linear combination of other columns. We also incorporate training data to further improve the sensing matrices through weighted coherence, weighted bi-coherence, or weighted tri-coherence criteria, which assign weights to sensing matrix columns as per their importance. An algorithm is also presented to solve the optimization problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through empirical results.

**Abstract:** The task of image-text matching aims to map representations from different modalities into a common joint visual-textual embedding. However, the most widely used datasets for this task, MSCOCO and Flickr30K, are actually image captioning datasets that offer a very limited set of relationships between images and sentences in their ground-truth annotations. This limited ground truth information forces us to use evaluation metrics based on binary relevance: given a sentence query we consider only one image as relevant. However, many other relevant images or captions may be present in the dataset. In this work, we propose two metrics that evaluate the degree of semantic relevance of retrieved items, independently of their annotated binary relevance. Additionally, we incorporate a novel strategy that uses an image captioning metric, CIDEr, to define a Semantic Adaptive Margin (SAM) to be optimized in a standard triplet loss. By incorporating our formulation to existing models, a \emph{large} improvement is obtained in scenarios where available training data is limited. We also demonstrate that the performance on the annotated image-caption pairs is maintained while improving on other non-annotated relevant items when employing the full training set. Code with our metrics and adaptive margin formulation will be made public.

**Abstract:** The present paper treats the identification of nonlinear dynamical systems using Koopman-based deep state-space encoders. Through this method, the usual drawback of needing to choose a dictionary of lifting functions a priori is circumvented. The encoder represents the lifting function to the space where the dynamics are linearly propagated using the Koopman operator. An input-affine formulation is considered for the lifted model structure and we address both full and partial state availability. The approach is implemented using the the deepSI toolbox in Python. To lower the computational need of the simulation error-based training, the data is split into subsections where multi-step prediction errors are calculated independently. This formulation allows for efficient batch optimization of the network parameters and, at the same time, excellent long term prediction capabilities of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by nonlinear benchmark examples.

**Abstract:** We propose a simple, practical and intuitive approach to improve the performance of a conventional controller in uncertain environments using deep reinforcement learning while maintaining safe operation. Our approach is motivated by the observation that conventional controllers in industrial motion control value robustness over adaptivity to deal with different operating conditions and are suboptimal as a consequence. Reinforcement learning on the other hand can optimize a control signal directly from input-output data and thus adapt to operational conditions, but lacks safety guarantees, impeding its use in industrial environments. To realize adaptive control using reinforcement learning in such conditions, we follow a residual learning methodology, where a reinforcement learning algorithm learns corrective adaptations to a base controller's output to increase optimality. We investigate how constraining the residual agent's actions enables to leverage the base controller's robustness to guarantee safe operation. We detail the algorithmic design and propose to constrain the residual actions relative to the base controller to increase the method's robustness. Building on Lyapunov stability theory, we prove stability for a broad class of mechatronic closed-loop systems. We validate our method experimentally on a slider-crank setup and investigate how the constraints affect the safety during learning and optimality after convergence.

**Abstract:** Backward propagation of errors (backpropagation) is a method to minimize objective functions (e.g., loss functions) of deep neural networks by identifying optimal sets of weights and biases. Imposing constraints on weight precision is often required to alleviate prohibitive workloads on hardware. Despite the remarkable success of backpropagation, the algorithm itself is not capable of considering such constraints unless additional algorithms are applied simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose the constrained backpropagation (CBP) algorithm based on a pseudo-Lagrange multiplier method to obtain the optimal set of weights that satisfy a given set of constraints. The defining characteristic of the proposed CBP algorithm is the utilization of a Lagrangian function (loss function plus constraint function) as its objective function. We considered various types of constraints--binary, ternary, one-bit shift, and two-bit shift weight constraints. As a post-training method, CBP applied to AlexNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet on ImageNet, which were pre-trained using the conventional backpropagation. For all cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet, e.g., 66.6%, 74.4%, and 64.0% top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet with binary weights, respectively. This highlights CBP as a learning algorithm to address diverse constraints with the minimal performance loss by employing appropriate constraint functions.

**Abstract:** Transforming large deep neural network (DNN) models into the multi-exit architectures can overcome the overthinking issue and distribute a large DNN model on resource-constrained scenarios (e.g. IoT frontend devices and backend servers) for inference and transmission efficiency. Nevertheless, intellectual property (IP) protection for the multi-exit models in the wild is still an unsolved challenge. Previous efforts to verify DNN model ownership mainly rely on querying the model with specific samples and checking the responses, e.g., DNN watermarking and fingerprinting. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial settings such as adversarial training and are not suitable for the IP verification for multi-exit DNN models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to fingerprint multi-exit models via inference time rather than inference predictions. Specifically, we design an effective method to generate a set of fingerprint samples to craft the inference process with a unique and robust inference time cost as the evidence for model ownership. We conduct extensive experiments to prove the uniqueness and robustness of our method on three structures (ResNet-56, VGG-16, and MobileNet) and three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) under comprehensive adversarial settings.

**Abstract:** Autonomous vision-based spaceborne navigation is an enabling technology for future on-orbit servicing and space logistics missions. While computer vision in general has benefited from Machine Learning (ML), training and validating spaceborne ML models are extremely challenging due to the impracticality of acquiring a large-scale labeled dataset of images of the intended target in the space environment. Existing datasets, such as Spacecraft PosE Estimation Dataset (SPEED), have so far mostly relied on synthetic images for both training and validation, which are easy to mass-produce but fail to resemble the visual features and illumination variability inherent to the target spaceborne images. In order to bridge the gap between the current practices and the intended applications in future space missions, this paper introduces SPEED+: the next generation spacecraft pose estimation dataset with specific emphasis on domain gap. In addition to 60,000 synthetic images for training, SPEED+ includes 9,531 hardware-in-the-loop images of a spacecraft mockup model captured from the Testbed for Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) facility. TRON is a first-of-a-kind robotic testbed capable of capturing an arbitrary number of target images with accurate and maximally diverse pose labels and high-fidelity spaceborne illumination conditions. SPEED+ is used in the second international Satellite Pose Estimation Challenge co-hosted by SLAB and the Advanced Concepts Team of the European Space Agency to evaluate and compare the robustness of spaceborne ML models trained on synthetic images.

**Abstract:** We study the privacy implications of deploying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in machine learning models. We focus on a class of privacy threats, called membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether or not specific data records have been used to train a model. Considering three machine learning applications, namely, machine translation, deep reinforcement learning, and image classification, we provide empirical evidence that RNNs are more vulnerable to MIAs than the alternative feed-forward architectures. We then study differential privacy methods to protect the privacy of the training dataset of RNNs. These methods are known to provide rigorous privacy guarantees irrespective of the adversary's model. We develop an alternative differential privacy mechanism to the so-called DP-FedAvg algorithm, which instead of obfuscating gradients during training, obfuscates the model's output. Unlike the existing work, the mechanism allows for post-training adjustment of the privacy parameters without having to retrain the model. We provide numerical results suggesting that the mechanism provides a strong shield against MIAs while trading off marginal utility.

**Abstract:** Recently, GAN inversion methods combined with Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) enables zero-shot image manipulation guided by text prompts. However, their applications to diverse real images are still difficult due to the limited GAN inversion capability. Specifically, these approaches often have difficulties in reconstructing images with novel poses, views, and highly variable contents compared to the training data, altering object identity, or producing unwanted image artifacts. To mitigate these problems and enable faithful manipulation of real images, we propose a novel method, dubbed DiffusionCLIP, that performs text-driven image manipulation using diffusion models. Based on full inversion capability and high-quality image generation power of recent diffusion models, our method performs zero-shot image manipulation successfully even between unseen domains. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise combination method that allows straightforward multi-attribute manipulation. Extensive experiments and human evaluation confirmed robust and superior manipulation performance of our methods compared to the existing baselines.
