**Abstract:** In this article, we present a visual introduction to Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), an approximate probabilistic inference algorithm that operates by passing messages between the nodes of arbitrarily structured factor graphs. A special case of loopy belief propagation, GBP updates rely only on local information and will converge independently of the message schedule. Our key argument is that, given recent trends in computing hardware, GBP has the right computational properties to act as a scalable distributed probabilistic inference framework for future machine learning systems.

**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images. The source code and models are released at https://github.com/NVIDIA/transformer-ls .

**Abstract:** Can we use machine learning to compress graph data? The absence of ordering in graphs poses a significant challenge to conventional compression algorithms, limiting their attainable gains as well as their ability to discover relevant patterns. On the other hand, most graph compression approaches rely on domain-dependent handcrafted representations and cannot adapt to different underlying graph distributions. This work aims to establish the necessary principles a lossless graph compression method should follow to approach the entropy storage lower bound. Instead of making rigid assumptions about the graph distribution, we formulate the compressor as a probabilistic model that can be learned from data and generalise to unseen instances. Our "Partition and Code" framework entails three steps: first, a partitioning algorithm decomposes the graph into subgraphs, then these are mapped to the elements of a small dictionary on which we learn a probability distribution, and finally, an entropy encoder translates the representation into bits. All the components (partitioning, dictionary and distribution) are parametric and can be trained with gradient descent. We theoretically compare the compression quality of several graph encodings and prove, under mild conditions, that PnC achieves compression gains that grow either linearly or quadratically with the number of vertices. Empirically, PnC yields significant compression improvements on diverse real-world networks.

**Abstract:** Rap generation, which aims to produce lyrics and corresponding singing beats, needs to model both rhymes and rhythms. Previous works for rap generation focused on rhyming lyrics but ignored rhythmic beats, which are important for rap performance. In this paper, we develop DeepRapper, a Transformer-based rap generation system that can model both rhymes and rhythms. Since there is no available rap dataset with rhythmic beats, we develop a data mining pipeline to collect a large-scale rap dataset, which includes a large number of rap songs with aligned lyrics and rhythmic beats. Second, we design a Transformer-based autoregressive language model which carefully models rhymes and rhythms. Specifically, we generate lyrics in the reverse order with rhyme representation and constraint for rhyme enhancement and insert a beat symbol into lyrics for rhythm/beat modeling. To our knowledge, DeepRapper is the first system to generate rap with both rhymes and rhythms. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that DeepRapper generates creative and high-quality raps with rhymes and rhythms. Code will be released on GitHub.

**Abstract:** The world is composed of objects, the ground, and the sky. Visual perception of objects requires solving two fundamental challenges: segmenting visual input into discrete units, and tracking identities of these units despite appearance changes due to object deformation, changing perspective, and dynamic occlusion. Current computer vision approaches to segmentation and tracking that approach human performance all require learning, raising the question: can objects be segmented and tracked without learning? Here, we show that the mathematical structure of light rays reflected from environment surfaces yields a natural representation of persistent surfaces, and this surface representation provides a solution to both the segmentation and tracking problems. We describe how to generate this surface representation from continuous visual input, and demonstrate that our approach can segment and invariantly track objects in cluttered synthetic video despite severe appearance changes, without requiring learning.

**Abstract:** Aggregating multiple sources of weak supervision (WS) can ease the data-labeling bottleneck prevalent in many machine learning applications, by replacing the tedious manual collection of ground truth labels. Current state of the art approaches that do not use any labeled training data, however, require two separate modeling steps: Learning a probabilistic latent variable model based on the WS sources -- making assumptions that rarely hold in practice -- followed by downstream model training. Importantly, the first step of modeling does not consider the performance of the downstream model. To address these caveats we propose an end-to-end approach for directly learning the downstream model by maximizing its agreement with probabilistic labels generated by reparameterizing previous probabilistic posteriors with a neural network. Our results show improved performance over prior work in terms of end model performance on downstream test sets, as well as in terms of improved robustness to dependencies among weak supervision sources.

**Abstract:** Deep learning has advanced from fully connected architectures to structured models organized into components, e.g., the transformer composed of positional elements, modular architectures divided into slots, and graph neural nets made up of nodes. In structured models, an interesting question is how to conduct dynamic and possibly sparse communication among the separate components. Here, we explore the hypothesis that restricting the transmitted information among components to discrete representations is a beneficial bottleneck. The motivating intuition is human language in which communication occurs through discrete symbols. Even though individuals have different understandings of what a "cat" is based on their specific experiences, the shared discrete token makes it possible for communication among individuals to be unimpeded by individual differences in internal representation. To discretize the values of concepts dynamically communicated among specialist components, we extend the quantization mechanism from the Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder to multi-headed discretization with shared codebooks and use it for discrete-valued neural communication (DVNC). Our experiments show that DVNC substantially improves systematic generalization in a variety of architectures -- transformers, modular architectures, and graph neural networks. We also show that the DVNC is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, making the method very useful in practice. Moreover, we establish a theoretical justification of our discretization process, proving that it has the ability to increase noise robustness and reduce the underlying dimensionality of the model.

**Abstract:** Active learning promises to alleviate the massive data needs of supervised machine learning: it has successfully improved sample efficiency by an order of magnitude on traditional tasks like topic classification and object recognition. However, we uncover a striking contrast to this promise: across 5 models and 4 datasets on the task of visual question answering, a wide variety of active learning approaches fail to outperform random selection. To understand this discrepancy, we profile 8 active learning methods on a per-example basis, and identify the problem as collective outliers -- groups of examples that active learning methods prefer to acquire but models fail to learn (e.g., questions that ask about text in images or require external knowledge). Through systematic ablation experiments and qualitative visualizations, we verify that collective outliers are a general phenomenon responsible for degrading pool-based active learning. Notably, we show that active learning sample efficiency increases significantly as the number of collective outliers in the active learning pool decreases. We conclude with a discussion and prescriptive recommendations for mitigating the effects of these outliers in future work.

**Abstract:** Tracking objects of interest in a video is one of the most popular and widely applicable problems in computer vision. However, with the years, a Cambrian explosion of use cases and benchmarks has fragmented the problem in a multitude of different experimental setups. As a consequence, the literature has fragmented too, and now novel approaches proposed by the community are usually specialised to fit only one specific setup. To understand to what extent this specialisation is necessary, in this work we present UniTrack, a solution to address five different tasks within the same framework. UniTrack consists of a single and task-agnostic appearance model, which can be learned in a supervised or self-supervised fashion, and multiple ``heads'' that address individual tasks and do not require training. We show how most tracking tasks can be solved within this framework, and that the same appearance model can be successfully used to obtain results that are competitive against specialised methods for most of the tasks considered. The framework also allows us to analyse appearance models obtained with the most recent self-supervised methods, thus extending their evaluation and comparison to a larger variety of important problems.

**Abstract:** Recent studies assessing the efficacy of pruning neural networks methods uncovered a surprising finding: when conducting ablation studies on existing pruning-at-initialization methods, namely SNIP, GraSP, SynFlow, and magnitude pruning, performances of these methods remain unchanged and sometimes even improve when randomly shuffling the mask positions within each layer (Layerwise Shuffling) or sampling new initial weight values (Reinit), while keeping pruning masks the same. We attempt to understand the reason behind such network immunity towards weight/mask modifications, by studying layer-wise statistics before and after randomization operations. We found that under each of the pruning-at-initialization methods, the distribution of unpruned weights changed minimally with randomization operations.

**Abstract:** Humans and other intelligent animals evolved highly sophisticated perception systems that combine multiple sensory modalities. On the other hand, state-of-the-art artificial agents rely mostly on visual inputs or structured low-dimensional observations provided by instrumented environments. Learning to act based on combined visual and auditory inputs is still a new topic of research that has not been explored beyond simple scenarios. To facilitate progress in this area we introduce a new version of VizDoom simulator to create a highly efficient learning environment that provides raw audio observations. We study the performance of different model architectures in a series of tasks that require the agent to recognize sounds and execute instructions given in natural language. Finally, we train our agent to play the full game of Doom and find that it can consistently defeat a traditional vision-based adversary. We are currently in the process of merging the augmented simulator with the main ViZDoom code repository.

**Abstract:** Modelling functions of sets, or equivalently, permutation-invariant functions, is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. Deep Sets is a popular method which is known to be a universal approximator for continuous set functions. We provide a theoretical analysis of Deep Sets which shows that this universal approximation property is only guaranteed if the model's latent space is sufficiently high-dimensional. If the latent space is even one dimension lower than necessary, there exist piecewise-affine functions for which Deep Sets performs no better than a naÃ¯ve constant baseline, as judged by worst-case error. Deep Sets may be viewed as the most efficient incarnation of the Janossy pooling paradigm. We identify this paradigm as encompassing most currently popular set-learning methods. Based on this connection, we discuss the implications of our results for set learning more broadly, and identify some open questions on the universality of Janossy pooling in general.

<p>

**Abstract:** We introduce TransformerFusion, a transformer-based 3D scene reconstruction approach. From an input monocular RGB video, the video frames are processed by a transformer network that fuses the observations into a volumetric feature grid representing the scene; this feature grid is then decoded into an implicit 3D scene representation. Key to our approach is the transformer architecture that enables the network to learn to attend to the most relevant image frames for each 3D location in the scene, supervised only by the scene reconstruction task. Features are fused in a coarse-to-fine fashion, storing fine-level features only where needed, requiring lower memory storage and enabling fusion at interactive rates. The feature grid is then decoded to a higher-resolution scene reconstruction, using an MLP-based surface occupancy prediction from interpolated coarse-to-fine 3D features. Our approach results in an accurate surface reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-view stereo depth estimation methods, fully-convolutional 3D reconstruction approaches, and approaches using LSTM- or GRU-based recurrent networks for video sequence fusion.

**Abstract:** An issue documents discussions around required changes in issue-tracking systems, while a commit contains the change itself in the version control systems. Recovering links between issues and commits can facilitate many software evolution tasks such as bug localization, and software documentation. A previous study on over half a million issues from GitHub reports only about 42.2% of issues are manually linked by developers to their pertinent commits. Automating the linking of commit-issue pairs can contribute to the improvement of the said tasks. By far, current state-of-the-art approaches for automated commit-issue linking suffer from low precision, leading to unreliable results, sometimes to the point that imposes human supervision on the predicted links. The low performance gets even more severe when there is a lack of textual information in either commits or issues. Current approaches are also proven computationally expensive.
  We propose Hybrid-Linker to overcome such limitations by exploiting two information channels; (1) a non-textual-based component that operates on non-textual, automatically recorded information of the commit-issue pairs to predict a link, and (2) a textual-based one which does the same using textual information of the commit-issue pairs. Then, combining the results from the two classifiers, Hybrid-Linker makes the final prediction. Thus, every time one component falls short in predicting a link, the other component fills the gap and improves the results. We evaluate Hybrid-Linker against competing approaches, namely FRLink and DeepLink on a dataset of 12 projects. Hybrid-Linker achieves 90.1%, 87.8%, and 88.9% based on recall, precision, and F-measure, respectively. It also outperforms FRLink and DeepLink by 31.3%, and 41.3%, regarding the F-measure. Moreover, Hybrid-Linker exhibits extensive improvements in terms of performance as well.

**Abstract:** Recent studies indicate that hierarchical Vision Transformer with a macro architecture of interleaved non-overlapped window-based self-attention \& shifted-window operation is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various visual recognition tasks, and challenges the ubiquitous convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using densely slid kernels. Most follow-up works attempt to replace the shifted-window operation with other kinds of cross-window communication paradigms, while treating self-attention as the de-facto standard for window-based information aggregation. In this manuscript, we question whether self-attention is the only choice for hierarchical Vision Transformer to attain strong performance, and the effects of different kinds of cross-window communication. To this end, we replace self-attention layers with embarrassingly simple linear mapping layers, and the resulting proof-of-concept architecture termed as LinMapper can achieve very strong performance in ImageNet-1k image recognition. Moreover, we find that LinMapper is able to better leverage the pre-trained representations from image recognition and demonstrates excellent transfer learning properties on downstream dense prediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We also experiment with other alternatives to self-attention for content aggregation inside each non-overlapped window under different cross-window communication approaches, which all give similar competitive results. Our study reveals that the \textbf{macro architecture} of Swin model families, other than specific aggregation layers or specific means of cross-window communication, may be more responsible for its strong performance and is the real challenger to the ubiquitous CNN's dense sliding window paradigm. Code and models will be publicly available to facilitate future research.

**Abstract:** Deep learning-based image super-resolution (DL-SR) has shown great promise in medical imaging applications. To date, most of the proposed methods for DL-SR have only been assessed by use of traditional measures of image quality (IQ) that are commonly employed in the field of computer vision. However, the impact of these methods on objective measures of image quality that are relevant to medical imaging tasks remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of DL-SR methods on binary signal detection performance. Two popular DL-SR methods, the super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and the super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN), were trained by use of simulated medical image data. Binary signal-known-exactly with background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) and signal-known-statistically with background-known-statistically (SKS/BKS) detection tasks were formulated. Numerical observers, which included a neural network-approximated ideal observer and common linear numerical observers, were employed to assess the impact of DL-SR on task performance. The impact of the complexity of the DL-SR network architectures on task-performance was quantified. In addition, the utility of DL-SR for improving the task-performance of sub-optimal observers was investigated. Our numerical experiments confirmed that, as expected, DL-SR could improve traditional measures of IQ. However, for many of the study designs considered, the DL-SR methods provided little or no improvement in task performance and could even degrade it. It was observed that DL-SR could improve the task-performance of sub-optimal observers under certain conditions. The presented study highlights the urgent need for the objective assessment of DL-SR methods and suggests avenues for improving their efficacy in medical imaging applications.

**Abstract:** Systems that can find correspondences between multiple modalities, such as between speech and images, have great potential to solve different recognition and data analysis tasks in an unsupervised manner. This work studies multimodal learning in the context of visually grounded speech (VGS) models, and focuses on their recently demonstrated capability to extract spatiotemporal alignments between spoken words and the corresponding visual objects without ever been explicitly trained for object localization or word recognition. As the main contributions, we formalize the alignment problem in terms of an audiovisual alignment tensor that is based on earlier VGS work, introduce systematic metrics for evaluating model performance in aligning visual objects and spoken words, and propose a new VGS model variant for the alignment task utilizing cross-modal attention layer. We test our model and a previously proposed model in the alignment task using SPEECH-COCO captions coupled with MSCOCO images. We compare the alignment performance using our proposed evaluation metrics to the semantic retrieval task commonly used to evaluate VGS models. We show that cross-modal attention layer not only helps the model to achieve higher semantic cross-modal retrieval performance, but also leads to substantial improvements in the alignment performance between image object and spoken words.

**Abstract:** Academic advances of AI models in high-precision domains, like healthcare, need to be made explainable in order to enhance real-world adoption. Our past studies and ongoing interactions indicate that medical experts can use AI systems with greater trust if there are ways to connect the model inferences about patients to explanations that are tied back to the context of use. Specifically, risk prediction is a complex problem of diagnostic and interventional importance to clinicians wherein they consult different sources to make decisions. To enable the adoption of the ever improving AI risk prediction models in practice, we have begun to explore techniques to contextualize such models along three dimensions of interest: the patients' clinical state, AI predictions about their risk of complications, and algorithmic explanations supporting the predictions. We validate the importance of these dimensions by implementing a proof-of-concept (POC) in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) use case where we assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) - a common T2DM comorbidity. Within the POC, we include risk prediction models for CKD, post-hoc explainers of the predictions, and other natural-language modules which operationalize domain knowledge and CPGs to provide context. With primary care physicians (PCP) as our end-users, we present our initial results and clinician feedback in this paper. Our POC approach covers multiple knowledge sources and clinical scenarios, blends knowledge to explain data and predictions to PCPs, and received an enthusiastic response from our medical expert.

**Abstract:** Adaptive Computation (AC) has been shown to be effective in improving the efficiency of Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) systems. However, current AC approaches require tuning of all model parameters, and training state-of-the-art ODQA models requires significant computational resources that may not be available for most researchers. We propose Adaptive Passage Encoder, an AC method that can be applied to an existing ODQA model and can be trained efficiently on a single GPU. It keeps the parameters of the base ODQA model fixed, but it overrides the default layer-by-layer computation of the encoder with an AC policy that is trained to optimise the computational efficiency of the model. Our experimental results show that our method improves upon a state-of-the-art model on two datasets, and is also more accurate than previous AC methods due to the stronger base ODQA model. All source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/uclnlp/APE.

**Abstract:** The last decade has seen a significant increase of interest in deep learning research, with many public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As such, these systems are now being incorporated into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback. Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes, or as the capabilities of the AI system improve.
  The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph of natural language: for example, "create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it", with additional clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations.
  Our hope is that this competition will improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the intent cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can also enable more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress on the value alignment problem.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of building entity tagging systems by using a few rules as weak supervision. Previous methods mostly focus on disambiguation entity types based on contexts and expert-provided rules, while assuming entity spans are given. In this work, we propose a novel method TALLOR that bootstraps high-quality logical rules to train a neural tagger in a fully automated manner. Specifically, we introduce compound rules that are composed from simple rules to increase the precision of boundary detection and generate more diverse pseudo labels. We further design a dynamic label selection strategy to ensure pseudo label quality and therefore avoid overfitting the neural tagger. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other weakly supervised methods and even rivals a state-of-the-art distantly supervised tagger with a lexicon of over 2,000 terms when starting from only 20 simple rules. Our method can serve as a tool for rapidly building taggers in emerging domains and tasks. Case studies show that learned rules can potentially explain the predicted entities.

However, the field has coalesced around automated estimates of topic coherence, which rely on the frequency of word co-occurrences in a reference corpus. Contemporary neural topic models surpass classical ones according to these metrics. At the same time, topic model evaluation suffers from a validation gap: automated coherence, developed for classical models, has not been validated using human experimentation for neural models. In addition, a meta-analysis of topic modeling literature reveals a substantial standardization gap in automated topic modeling benchmarks. To address the validation gap, we compare automated coherence with the two most widely accepted human judgment tasks: topic rating and word intrusion. To address the standardization gap, we systematically evaluate a dominant classical model and two state-of-the-art neural models on two commonly used datasets. Automated evaluations declare a winning model when corresponding human evaluations do not, calling into question the validity of fully automatic evaluations independent of human judgments.

<p>

**Abstract:** We present a new multiscale algorithm for solving regularized Optimal Transport problems on the GPU, with a linear memory footprint. Relying on Sinkhorn divergences which are convex, smooth and positive definite loss functions, this method enables the computation of transport plans between millions of points in a matter of minutes. We show the effectiveness of this approach on brain tractograms modeled either as bundles of fibers or as track density maps. We use the resulting smooth assignments to perform label transfer for atlas-based segmentation of fiber tractograms. The parameters -- blur and reach -- of our method are meaningful, defining the minimum and maximum distance at which two fibers are compared with each other. They can be set according to anatomical knowledge. Furthermore, we also propose to estimate a probabilistic atlas of a population of track density maps as a Wasserstein barycenter. Our CUDA implementation is endowed with a user-friendly PyTorch interface, freely available on the PyPi repository (pip install geomloss) and at www.kernel-operations.io/geomloss.

**Abstract:** We explore the potential to control terrain vehicles using deep reinforcement in scenarios where human operators and traditional control methods are inadequate. This letter presents a controller that perceives, plans, and successfully controls a 16-tonne forestry vehicle with two frame articulation joints, six wheels, and their actively articulated suspensions to traverse rough terrain. The carefully shaped reward signal promotes safe, environmental, and efficient driving, which leads to the emergence of unprecedented driving skills. We test learned skills in a virtual environment, including terrains reconstructed from high-density laser scans of forest sites. The controller displays the ability to handle obstructing obstacles, slopes up to 27$^\circ$, and a variety of natural terrains, all with limited wheel slip, smooth, and upright traversal with intelligent use of the active suspensions. The results confirm that deep reinforcement learning has the potential to enhance control of vehicles with complex dynamics and high-dimensional observation data compared to human operators or traditional control methods, especially in rough terrain.

**Abstract:** We use the aggregate information from individual-to-firm and firm-to-firm in Garanti BBVA Bank transactions to mimic domestic private demand. Particularly, we replicate the quarterly national accounts aggregate consumption and investment (gross fixed capital formation) and its bigger components (Machinery and Equipment and Construction) in real time for the case of Turkey. In order to validate the usefulness of the information derived from these indicators we test the nowcasting ability of both indicators to nowcast the Turkish GDP using different nowcasting models. The results are successful and confirm the usefulness of Consumption and Investment Banking transactions for nowcasting purposes. The value of the Big data information is more relevant at the beginning of the nowcasting process, when the traditional hard data information is scarce. This makes this information specially relevant for those countries where statistical release lags are longer like the Emerging Markets.

**Abstract:** Eluder dimension and information gain are two widely used methods of complexity measures in bandit and reinforcement learning. Eluder dimension was originally proposed as a general complexity measure of function classes, but the common examples of where it is known to be small are function spaces (vector spaces). In these cases, the primary tool to upper bound the eluder dimension is the elliptic potential lemma. Interestingly, the elliptic potential lemma also features prominently in the analysis of linear bandits/reinforcement learning and their nonparametric generalization, the information gain. We show that this is not a coincidence -- eluder dimension and information gain are equivalent in a precise sense for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

**Abstract:** Bone marrow cytology is required to make a hematological diagnosis, influencing critical clinical decision points in hematology. However, bone marrow cytology is tedious, limited to experienced reference centers and associated with high inter-observer variability. This may lead to a delayed or incorrect diagnosis, leaving an unmet need for innovative supporting technologies. We have developed the first ever end-to-end deep learning-based technology for automated bone marrow cytology. Starting with a bone marrow aspirate digital whole slide image, our technology rapidly and automatically detects suitable regions for cytology, and subsequently identifies and classifies all bone marrow cells in each region. This collective cytomorphological information is captured in a novel representation called Histogram of Cell Types (HCT) quantifying bone marrow cell class probability distribution and acting as a cytological "patient fingerprint". The approach achieves high accuracy in region detection (0.97 accuracy and 0.99 ROC AUC), and cell detection and cell classification (0.75 mAP, 0.78 F1-score, Log-average miss rate of 0.31). HCT has potential to revolutionize hematopathology diagnostic workflows, leading to more cost-effective, accurate diagnosis and opening the door to precision medicine.

**Abstract:** When data is collected in an adaptive manner, even simple methods like ordinary least squares can exhibit non-normal asymptotic behavior. As an undesirable consequence, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on asymptotic normality can lead to erroneous results. We propose an online debiasing estimator to correct these distributional anomalies in least squares estimation. Our proposed method takes advantage of the covariance structure present in the dataset and provides sharper estimates in directions for which more information has accrued. We establish an asymptotic normality property for our proposed online debiasing estimator under mild conditions on the data collection process, and provide asymptotically exact confidence intervals. We additionally prove a minimax lower bound for the adaptive linear regression problem, thereby providing a baseline by which to compare estimators. There are various conditions under which our proposed estimator achieves the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our theory via applications to multi-armed bandit, autoregressive time series estimation, and active learning with exploration.

**Abstract:** Imperfect labels limit the quality of predictions learned by deep neural networks. This is particularly relevant in medical image segmentation, where reference annotations are difficult to collect and vary significantly even across expert annotators. Prior work on mitigating label noise focused on simple models of mostly uniform noise. In this work, we explore biased and unbiased errors artificially introduced to brain tumour annotations on MRI data. We found that supervised and semi-supervised segmentation methods are robust or fairly robust to unbiased errors but sensitive to biased errors. It is therefore important to identify the sorts of errors expected in medical image labels and especially mitigate the biased errors.

**Abstract:** Affordances are the possibilities of actions the environment offers to the individual. Ordinary objects (hammer, knife) usually have many affordances (grasping, pounding, cutting), and detecting these allow artificial agents to understand what are their possibilities in the environment, with obvious application in Robotics. Proposed benchmarks and state-of-the-art prediction models for supervised affordance segmentation are usually modifications of popular object segmentation models such as Mask R-CNN. We observe that theoretically, these popular object segmentation methods should be sufficient for detecting affordances masks. So we ask the question: is it necessary to tailor new architectures to the problem of learning affordances? We show that applying the out-of-the-box Mask R-CNN to the problem of affordances segmentation outperforms the current state-of-the-art. We conclude that the problem of supervised affordance segmentation is included in the problem of object segmentation and argue that better benchmarks for affordance learning should include action capacities.

**Abstract:** Deepfakes pose growing challenges to the trust of information on the Internet. Thus, detecting deepfakes has attracted increasing attentions from both academia and industry. State-of-the-art deepfake detection methods consist of two key components, i.e., face extractor and face classifier, which extract the face region in an image and classify it to be real/fake, respectively. Existing studies mainly focused on improving the detection performance in non-adversarial settings, leaving security of deepfake detection in adversarial settings largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap. In particular, we perform a systematic measurement study to understand the security of the state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings. We use two large-scale public deepfakes data sources including FaceForensics++ and Facebook Deepfake Detection Challenge, where the deepfakes are fake face images; and we train state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods. These detection methods can achieve 0.94--0.99 accuracies in non-adversarial settings on these datasets. However, our measurement results uncover multiple security limitations of the deepfake detection methods in adversarial settings. First, we find that an attacker can evade a face extractor, i.e., the face extractor fails to extract the correct face regions, via adding small Gaussian noise to its deepfake images. Second, we find that a face classifier trained using deepfakes generated by one method cannot detect deepfakes generated by another method, i.e., an attacker can evade detection via generating deepfakes using a new method. Third, we find that an attacker can leverage backdoor attacks developed by the adversarial machine learning community to evade a face classifier. Our results highlight that deepfake detection should consider the adversarial nature of the problem.

**Abstract:** As a critical component for online advertising and marking, click-through rate (CTR) prediction has draw lots of attentions from both industry and academia field. Recently, the deep learning has become the mainstream methodological choice for CTR. Despite of sustainable efforts have been made, existing approaches still pose several challenges. On the one hand, high-order interaction between the features is under-explored. On the other hand, high-order interactions may neglect the semantic information from the low-order fields. In this paper, we proposed a novel prediction method, named FINT, that employs the Field-aware INTeraction layer which captures high-order feature interactions while retaining the low-order field information. To empirically investigate the effectiveness and robustness of the FINT, we perform extensive experiments on the three realistic databases: KDD2012, Criteo and Avazu. The obtained results demonstrate that the FINT can significantly improve the performance compared to the existing methods, without increasing the amount of computation required. Moreover, the proposed method brought about 2.72\% increase to the advertising revenue of a big online video app through A/B testing. To better promote the research in CTR field, we released our code as well as reference implementation at: https://github.com/zhishan01/FINT.

**Abstract:** Transforming a causal system from a given initial state to a desired target state is an important task permeating multiple fields including control theory, biology, and materials science. In causal models, such transformations can be achieved by performing a set of interventions. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying a shift intervention that matches the desired mean of a system through active learning. We define the Markov equivalence class that is identifiable from shift interventions and propose two active learning strategies that are guaranteed to exactly match a desired mean. We then derive a worst-case lower bound for the number of interventions required and show that these strategies are optimal for certain classes of graphs. In particular, we show that our strategies may require exponentially fewer interventions than the previously considered approaches, which optimize for structure learning in the underlying causal graph. In line with our theoretical results, we also demonstrate experimentally that our proposed active learning strategies require fewer interventions compared to several baselines.

**Abstract:** With the widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), machine learning algorithms have evolved in two diverse directions -- one with ever-increasing connection density for better accuracy and the other with more compact sizing for energy efficiency. The increase in connection density increases on-chip data movement, which makes efficient on-chip communication a critical function of the DNN accelerator. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we illustrate that the point-to-point (P2P)-based interconnect is incapable of handling a high volume of on-chip data movement for DNNs. Second, we evaluate P2P and network-on-chip (NoC) interconnect (with a regular topology such as a mesh) for SRAM- and ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures for a range of DNNs. This analysis shows the necessity for the optimal interconnect choice for an IMC DNN accelerator. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation for different DNNs to empirically obtain the performance of the IMC architecture with both NoC-tree and NoC-mesh. We conclude that, at the tile level, NoC-tree is appropriate for compact DNNs employed at the edge, and NoC-mesh is necessary to accelerate DNNs with high connection density. Furthermore, we propose a technique to determine the optimal choice of interconnect for any given DNN. In this technique, we use analytical models of NoC to evaluate end-to-end communication latency of any given DNN. We demonstrate that the interconnect optimization in the IMC architecture results in up to 6$\times$ improvement in energy-delay-area product for VGG-19 inference compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based IMC architectures.

**Abstract:** This work focuses on learning useful and robust deep world models using multiple, possibly unreliable, sensors. We find that current methods do not sufficiently encourage a shared representation between modalities; this can cause poor performance on downstream tasks and over-reliance on specific sensors. As a solution, we contribute a new multi-modal deep latent state-space model, trained using a mutual information lower-bound. The key innovation is a specially-designed density ratio estimator that encourages consistency between the latent codes of each modality. We tasked our method to learn policies (in a self-supervised manner) on multi-modal Natural MuJoCo benchmarks and a challenging Table Wiping task. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods, particularly in the presence of missing observations.

**Abstract:** Vanilla models for object detection and instance segmentation suffer from the heavy bias toward detecting frequent objects in the long-tailed setting. Existing methods address this issue mostly during training, e.g., by re-sampling or re-weighting. In this paper, we investigate a largely overlooked approach -- post-processing calibration of confidence scores. We propose NorCal, Normalized Calibration for long-tailed object detection and instance segmentation, a simple and straightforward recipe that reweighs the predicted scores of each class by its training sample size. We show that separately handling the background class and normalizing the scores over classes for each proposal are keys to achieving superior performance. On the LVIS dataset, NorCal can effectively improve nearly all the baseline models not only on rare classes but also on common and frequent classes. Finally, we conduct extensive analysis and ablation studies to offer insights into various modeling choices and mechanisms of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tydpan/NorCal/.

**Abstract:** In this paper we investigate the amount of spatial context required for channel attention. To this end we study the popular squeeze-and-excite (SE) block which is a simple and lightweight channel attention mechanism. SE blocks and its numerous variants commonly use global average pooling (GAP) to create a single descriptor for each channel. Here, we empirically analyze the amount of spatial context needed for effective channel attention and find that limited localcontext on the order of seven rows or columns of the original image is sufficient to match the performance of global context. We propose tiled squeeze-and-excite (TSE), which is a framework for building SE-like blocks that employ several descriptors per channel, with each descriptor based on local context only. We further show that TSE is a drop-in replacement for the SE block and can be used in existing SE networks without re-training. This implies that local context descriptors are similar both to each other and to the global context descriptor. Finally, we show that TSE has important practical implications for deployment of SE-networks to dataflow AI accelerators due to their reduced pipeline buffering requirements. For example, using TSE reduces the amount of activation pipeline buffering in EfficientDetD2 by 90% compared to SE (from 50M to 4.77M) without loss of accuracy. Our code and pre-trained models will be publicly available.

**Abstract:** Subtype Discovery consists in finding interpretable and consistent sub-parts of a dataset, which are also relevant to a certain supervised task. From a mathematical point of view, this can be defined as a clustering task driven by supervised learning in order to uncover subgroups in line with the supervised prediction. In this paper, we propose a general Expectation-Maximization ensemble framework entitled UCSL (Unsupervised Clustering driven by Supervised Learning). Our method is generic, it can integrate any clustering method and can be driven by both binary classification and regression. We propose to construct a non-linear model by merging multiple linear estimators, one per cluster. Each hyperplane is estimated so that it correctly discriminates - or predict - only one cluster. We use SVC or Logistic Regression for classification and SVR for regression. Furthermore, to perform cluster analysis within a more suitable space, we also propose a dimension-reduction algorithm that projects the data onto an orthonormal space relevant to the supervised task. We analyze the robustness and generalization capability of our algorithm using synthetic and experimental datasets. In particular, we validate its ability to identify suitable consistent sub-types by conducting a psychiatric-diseases cluster analysis with known ground-truth labels. The gain of the proposed method over previous state-of-the-art techniques is about +1.9 points in terms of balanced accuracy. Finally, we make codes and examples available in a scikit-learn-compatible Python package at https://github.com/neurospin-projects/2021_rlouiset_ucsl

**Abstract:** This paper studies probability distributions of penultimate activations of classification networks. We show that, when a classification network is trained with the cross-entropy loss, its final classification layer forms a Generative-Discriminative pair with a generative classifier based on a specific distribution of penultimate activations. More importantly, the distribution is parameterized by the weights of the final fully-connected layer, and can be considered as a generative model that synthesizes the penultimate activations without feeding input data. We empirically demonstrate that this generative model enables stable knowledge distillation in the presence of domain shift, and can transfer knowledge from a classifier to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for class-conditional image generation.

**Abstract:** Model-based deep reinforcement learning has achieved success in various domains that require high sample efficiencies, such as Go and robotics. However, there are some remaining issues, such as planning efficient explorations to learn more accurate dynamic models, evaluating the uncertainty of the learned models, and more rational utilization of models. To mitigate these issues, we present MEEE, a model-ensemble method that consists of optimistic exploration and weighted exploitation. During exploration, unlike prior methods directly selecting the optimal action that maximizes the expected accumulative return, our agent first generates a set of action candidates and then seeks out the optimal action that takes both expected return and future observation novelty into account. During exploitation, different discounted weights are assigned to imagined transition tuples according to their model uncertainty respectively, which will prevent model predictive error propagation in agent training. Experiments on several challenging continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrated that our approach outperforms other model-free and model-based state-of-the-art methods, especially in sample complexity.

**Abstract:** Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing adoption of Deep Learning (DL) based software systems in many industries. Designing a DL program requires constructing a deep neural network (DNN) and then training it on a dataset. This process requires that developers make multiple architectural (e.g., type, size, number, and order of layers) and configuration (e.g., optimizer, regularization methods, and activation functions) choices that affect the quality of the DL models, and consequently software quality. An under-specified or poorly-designed DL model may train successfully but is likely to perform poorly when deployed in production. Design smells in DL programs are poor design and-or configuration decisions taken during the development of DL components, that are likely to have a negative impact on the performance (i.e., prediction accuracy) and then quality of DL based software systems. In this paper, we present a catalogue of 8 design smells for a popular DL architecture, namely deep Feedforward Neural Networks which is widely employed in industrial applications. The design smells were identified through a review of the existing literature on DL design and a manual inspection of 659 DL programs with performance issues and design inefficiencies. The smells are specified by describing their context, consequences, and recommended refactorings. To provide empirical evidence on the relevance and perceived impact of the proposed design smells, we conducted a survey with 81 DL developers. In general, the developers perceived the proposed design smells as reflective of design or implementation problems, with agreement levels varying between 47\% and 68\%.

**Abstract:** Although transformers have become the neural architectures of choice for natural language processing, they require orders of magnitude more training data, GPU memory, and computations in order to compete with convolutional neural networks for computer vision. The attention mechanism of transformers scales quadratically with the length of the input sequence, and unrolled images have long sequence lengths. Plus, transformers lack an inductive bias that is appropriate for images. We tested three modifications to vision transformer (ViT) architectures that address these shortcomings. Firstly, we alleviate the quadratic bottleneck by using linear attention mechanisms, called X-formers (such that, X in {Performer, Linformer, NystrÃ¶mformer}), thereby creating Vision X-formers (ViXs). This resulted in up to a seven times reduction in the GPU memory requirement. We also compared their performance with FNet and multi-layer perceptron mixers, which further reduced the GPU memory requirement. Secondly, we introduced an inductive bias for images by replacing the initial linear embedding layer by convolutional layers in ViX, which significantly increased classification accuracy without increasing the model size. Thirdly, we replaced the learnable 1D position embeddings in ViT with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which increases the classification accuracy for the same model size. We believe that incorporating such changes can democratize transformers by making them accessible to those with limited data and computing resources.

**Abstract:** We design and develop a new Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulations using Deep-Learning (DL) to calculate the electric field from the electron phase space. We train a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve the two-stream instability test. We verify that the DL-based MLP PIC method produces the correct results using the two-stream instability: the DL-based PIC provides the expected growth rate of the two-stream instability. The DL-based PIC does not conserve the total energy and momentum. However, the DL-based PIC method is stable against the cold-beam instability, affecting traditional PIC methods. This work shows that integrating DL technologies into traditional computational methods is a viable approach for developing next-generation PIC algorithms.

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often have poor generalization performance under domain shift. One way to improve domain generalization is to collect diverse source data from multiple relevant domains so that a CNN model is allowed to learn more domain-invariant, and hence generalizable representations. In this work, we address domain generalization with MixStyle, a plug-and-play, parameter-free module that is simply inserted to shallow CNN layers and requires no modification to training objectives. Specifically, MixStyle probabilistically mixes feature statistics between instances. This idea is inspired by the observation that visual domains can often be characterized by image styles which are in turn encapsulated within instance-level feature statistics in shallow CNN layers. Therefore, inserting MixStyle modules in effect synthesizes novel domains albeit in an implicit way. MixStyle is not only simple and flexible, but also versatile -- it can be used for problems whereby unlabeled images are available, such as semi-supervised domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation, with a simple extension to mix feature statistics between labeled and pseudo-labeled instances. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MixStyle can significantly boost the out-of-distribution generalization performance across a wide range of tasks including object recognition, instance retrieval, and reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:** Applying neural network (NN) methods in games can lead to various new and exciting game dynamics not previously possible. However, they also lead to new challenges such as the lack of large, clean datasets, varying player skill levels, and changing gameplay strategies. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial player strategy aspect in the game iNNk, in which players try to communicate secret code words through drawings with the goal of not being deciphered by a NN. Some strategies exploit weaknesses in the NN that consistently trick it into making incorrect classifications, leading to unbalanced gameplay. We present a method that combines transfer learning and ensemble methods to obtain a data-efficient adaptation to these strategies. This combination significantly outperforms the baseline NN across all adversarial player strategies despite only being trained on a limited set of adversarial examples. We expect the methods developed in this paper to be useful for the rapidly growing field of NN-based games, which will require new approaches to deal with unforeseen player creativity.

**Abstract:** Person re-identification via 3D skeletons is an emerging topic with great potential in security-critical applications. Existing methods typically learn body and motion features from the body-joint trajectory, whereas they lack a systematic way to model body structure and underlying relations of body components beyond the scale of body joints. In this paper, we for the first time propose a Self-supervised Multi-scale Skeleton Graph Encoding (SM-SGE) framework that comprehensively models human body, component relations, and skeleton dynamics from unlabeled skeleton graphs of various scales to learn an effective skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Specifically, we first devise multi-scale skeleton graphs with coarse-to-fine human body partitions, which enables us to model body structure and skeleton dynamics at multiple levels. Second, to mine inherent correlations between body components in skeletal motion, we propose a multi-scale graph relation network to learn structural relations between adjacent body-component nodes and collaborative relations among nodes of different scales, so as to capture more discriminative skeleton graph features. Last, we propose a novel multi-scale skeleton reconstruction mechanism to enable our framework to encode skeleton dynamics and high-level semantics from unlabeled skeleton graphs, which encourages learning a discriminative skeleton representation for person Re-ID. Extensive experiments show that SM-SGE outperforms most state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on 3D skeleton data estimated from large-scale RGB videos. Our codes are open at https://github.com/Kali-Hac/SM-SGE.

**Abstract:** In this paper, a novel confidence conditioned knowledge distillation (CCKD) scheme for transferring the knowledge from a teacher model to a student model is proposed. Existing state-of-the-art methods employ fixed loss functions for this purpose and ignore the different levels of information that need to be transferred for different samples. In addition to that, these methods are also inefficient in terms of data usage. CCKD addresses these issues by leveraging the confidence assigned by the teacher model to the correct class to devise sample-specific loss functions (CCKD-L formulation) and targets (CCKD-T formulation). Further, CCKD improves the data efficiency by employing self-regulation to stop those samples from participating in the distillation process on which the student model learns faster. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets show that CCKD methods achieve at least as much generalization performance levels as other state-of-the-art methods while being data efficient in the process. Student models trained through CCKD methods do not retain most of the misclassifications commited by the teacher model on the training set. Distillation through CCKD methods improves the resilience of the student models against adversarial attacks compared to the conventional KD method. Experiments show at least 3% increase in performance against adversarial attacks for the MNIST and the Fashion MNIST datasets, and at least 6% increase for the CIFAR10 dataset.

**Abstract:** Network data are ubiquitous in modern machine learning, with tasks of interest including node classification, node clustering and link prediction. A frequent approach begins by learning an Euclidean embedding of the network, to which algorithms developed for vector-valued data are applied. For large networks, embeddings are learned using stochastic gradient methods where the sub-sampling scheme can be freely chosen. Despite the strong empirical performance of such methods, they are not well understood theoretically. Our work encapsulates representation methods using a subsampling approach, such as node2vec, into a single unifying framework. We prove, under the assumption that the graph is exchangeable, that the distribution of the learned embedding vectors asymptotically decouples. Moreover, we characterize the asymptotic distribution and provided rates of convergence, in terms of the latent parameters, which includes the choice of loss function and the embedding dimension. This provides a theoretical foundation to understand what the embedding vectors represent and how well these methods perform on downstream tasks. Notably, we observe that typically used loss functions may lead to shortcomings, such as a lack of Fisher consistency.

**Abstract:** This paper builds the clustering model of measures of market microstructure features which are popular in predicting the stock returns. In a 10-second time frequency, we study the clustering structure of different measures to find out the best ones for predicting. In this way, we can predict more accurately with a limited number of predictors, which removes the noise and makes the model more interpretable.

**Abstract:** Human body volume estimation from a single RGB image is a challenging problem despite minimal attention from the research community. However VolNet, an architecture leveraging 2D and 3D pose estimation, body part segmentation and volume regression extracted from a single 2D RGB image combined with the subject's body height can be used to estimate the total body volume. VolNet is designed to predict the 2D and 3D pose as well as the body part segmentation in intermediate tasks. We generated a synthetic, large-scale dataset of photo-realistic images of human bodies with a wide range of body shapes and realistic poses called SURREALvols. By using Volnet and combining multiple stacked hourglass networks together with ResNeXt, our model correctly predicted the volume in ~82% of cases with a 10% tolerance threshold. This is a considerable improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions such as BodyNet with only a ~38% success rate.

**Abstract:** We explore relations between the hyper-parameters of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and the complexity of string sequences it is able to memorize. We compare long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs). We find that an increase of RNN depth does not necessarily result in better memorization capability when the training time is constrained. Our results also indicate that the learning rate and the number of units per layer are among the most important hyper-parameters to be tuned. Generally, GRUs outperform LSTM networks on low complexity sequences while on high complexity sequences LSTMs perform better.

**Abstract:** A recurring theme in statistical learning, online learning, and beyond is that faster convergence rates are possible for problems with low noise, often quantified by the performance of the best hypothesis; such results are known as first-order or small-loss guarantees. While first-order guarantees are relatively well understood in statistical and online learning, adapting to low noise in contextual bandits (and more broadly, decision making) presents major algorithmic challenges. In a COLT 2017 open problem, Agarwal, Krishnamurthy, Langford, Luo, and Schapire asked whether first-order guarantees are even possible for contextual bandits and -- if so -- whether they can be attained by efficient algorithms. We give a resolution to this question by providing an optimal and efficient reduction from contextual bandits to online regression with the logarithmic (or, cross-entropy) loss. Our algorithm is simple and practical, readily accommodates rich function classes, and requires no distributional assumptions beyond realizability. In a large-scale empirical evaluation, we find that our approach typically outperforms comparable non-first-order methods.
  On the technical side, we show that the logarithmic loss and an information-theoretic quantity called the triangular discrimination play a fundamental role in obtaining first-order guarantees, and we combine this observation with new refinements to the regression oracle reduction framework of Foster and Rakhlin. The use of triangular discrimination yields novel results even for the classical statistical learning model, and we anticipate that it will find broader use.

**Abstract:** Meta-learning aims to learn a model that can handle multiple tasks generated from an unknown but shared distribution. However, typical meta-learning algorithms have assumed the tasks to be similar such that a single meta-learner is sufficient to aggregate the variations in all aspects. In addition, there has been less consideration on uncertainty when limited information is given as context. In this paper, we devise a novel meta-learning framework, called Meta-learning Amidst Heterogeneity and Ambiguity (MAHA), that outperforms previous works in terms of prediction based on its ability on task identification. By extensively conducting several experiments in regression and classification, we demonstrate the validity of our model, which turns out to be robust to both task heterogeneity and ambiguity.

**Abstract:** Despite significant interest in developing general purpose fact checking models, it is challenging to construct a large-scale fact verification dataset with realistic claims that would occur in the real world. Existing claims are either authored by crowdworkers, thereby introducing subtle biases that are difficult to control for, or manually verified by professional fact checkers, causing them to be expensive and limited in scale. In this paper, we construct a challenging, realistic, and large-scale fact verification dataset called FaVIQ, using information-seeking questions posed by real users who do not know how to answer. The ambiguity in information-seeking questions enables automatically constructing true and false claims that reflect confusions arisen from users (e.g., the year of the movie being filmed vs. being released). Our claims are verified to be natural, contain little lexical bias, and require a complete understanding of the evidence for verification. Our experiments show that the state-of-the-art models are far from solving our new task. Moreover, training on our data helps in professional fact-checking, outperforming models trained on the most widely used dataset FEVER or in-domain data by up to 17% absolute. Altogether, our data will serve as a challenging benchmark for natural language understanding and support future progress in professional fact checking.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study feature cross search as a fundamental primitive in feature engineering. The importance of feature cross search especially for the linear model has been known for a while, with well-known textbook examples. In this problem, the goal is to select a small subset of features, combine them to form a new feature (called the crossed feature) by considering their Cartesian product, and find feature crosses to learn an \emph{accurate} model. In particular, we study the problem of maximizing a normalized Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the linear model trained on the crossed feature column.
  First, we show that it is not possible to provide an $n^{1/\log\log n}$-approximation algorithm for this problem unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. This result also rules out the possibility of solving this problem in polynomial time unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. On the positive side, by assuming the \naive\ assumption, we show that there exists a simple greedy $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for this problem. This result is established by relating the AUC to the total variation of the commutator of two probability measures and showing that the total variation of the commutator is monotone and submodular. To show this, we relate the submodularity of this function to the positive semi-definiteness of a corresponding kernel matrix. Then, we use Bochner's theorem to prove the positive semi-definiteness by showing that its inverse Fourier transform is non-negative everywhere. Our techniques and structural results might be of independent interest.

**Abstract:** Introducing sparsity in a neural network has been an efficient way to reduce its complexity while keeping its performance almost intact. Most of the time, sparsity is introduced using a three-stage pipeline: 1) train the model to convergence, 2) prune the model according to some criterion, 3) fine-tune the pruned model to recover performance. The last two steps are often performed iteratively, leading to reasonable results but also to a time-consuming and complex process. In our work, we propose to get rid of the first step of the pipeline and to combine the two other steps in a single pruning-training cycle, allowing the model to jointly learn for the optimal weights while being pruned. We do this by introducing a novel pruning schedule, named One-Cycle Pruning, which starts pruning from the beginning of the training, and until its very end. Adopting such a schedule not only leads to better performing pruned models but also drastically reduces the training budget required to prune a model. Experiments are conducted on a variety of architectures (VGG-16 and ResNet-18) and datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Caltech-101), and for relatively high sparsity values (80%, 90%, 95% of weights removed). Our results show that One-Cycle Pruning consistently outperforms commonly used pruning schedules such as One-Shot Pruning, Iterative Pruning and Automated Gradual Pruning, on a fixed training budget.

**Abstract:** Research on open-domain question answering (QA) has a long tradition. A challenge in this domain is answering complex questions (CQA) that require complex inference methods and large amounts of knowledge. In low resource languages, such as Persian, there are not many datasets for open-domain complex questions and also the language processing toolkits are not very accurate. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach for answering Persian complex questions using Farsbase; the Persian knowledge graph, exploiting PeCoQ; the newly created complex Persian question dataset. In this work, we handle multi-constraint and multi-hop questions by building their set of possible corresponding logical forms. Then Multilingual-BERT is used to select the logical form that best describes the input complex question syntactically and semantically. The answer to the question is built from the answer to the logical form, extracted from the knowledge graph. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other approaches in Persian CQA.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel graph clustering method guided by additional information on the underlying structure of the clusters (or communities). The problem is formulated as the matching of a graph to a template with smaller dimension, hence matching $n$ vertices of the observed graph (to be clustered) to the $k$ vertices of a template graph, using its edges as support information, and relaxed on the set of orthonormal matrices in order to find a $k$ dimensional embedding. With relevant priors that encode the density of the clusters and their relationships, our method outperforms classical methods, especially for challenging cases.

**Abstract:** The detection of semantic relationships between objects represented in an image is one of the fundamental challenges in image interpretation. Neural-Symbolic techniques, such as Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), allow the combination of semantic knowledge representation and reasoning with the ability to efficiently learn from examples typical of neural networks. We here propose Faster-LTN, an object detector composed of a convolutional backbone and an LTN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine both frameworks in an end-to-end training setting. This architecture is trained by optimizing a grounded theory which combines labelled examples with prior knowledge, in the form of logical axioms. Experimental comparisons show competitive performance with respect to the traditional Faster R-CNN architecture.

**Abstract:** Typical state of the art flow cytometry data samples consists of measures of more than 100.000 cells in 10 or more features. AI systems are able to diagnose such data with almost the same accuracy as human experts. However, there is one central challenge in such systems: their decisions have far-reaching consequences for the health and life of people, and therefore, the decisions of AI systems need to be understandable and justifiable by humans. In this work, we present a novel explainable AI method, called ALPODS, which is able to classify (diagnose) cases based on clusters, i.e., subpopulations, in the high-dimensional data. ALPODS is able to explain its decisions in a form that is understandable for human experts. For the identified subpopulations, fuzzy reasoning rules expressed in the typical language of domain experts are generated. A visualization method based on these rules allows human experts to understand the reasoning used by the AI system. A comparison to a selection of state of the art explainable AI systems shows that ALPODS operates efficiently on known benchmark data and also on everyday routine case data.

**Abstract:** Deep Learning (DL) has been successfully applied to a wide range of application domains, including safety-critical ones. Several DL testing approaches have been recently proposed in the literature but none of them aims to assess how different interpretable features of the generated inputs affect the system's behaviour. In this paper, we resort to Illumination Search to find the highest-performing test cases (i.e., misbehaving and closest to misbehaving), spread across the cells of a map representing the feature space of the system. We introduce a methodology that guides the users of our approach in the tasks of identifying and quantifying the dimensions of the feature space for a given domain. We developed DeepHyperion, a search-based tool for DL systems that illuminates, i.e., explores at large, the feature space, by providing developers with an interpretable feature map where automatically generated inputs are placed along with information about the exposed behaviours.

**Abstract:** Myocardial infarction disease (MID) is caused to the rapid progress of undiagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD) that indicates the injury of a heart cell by decreasing the blood flow to the cardiac muscles. MID is the leading cause of death in middle-aged and elderly subjects all over the world. In general, raw Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are tested for MID identification by clinicians that is exhausting, time-consuming, and expensive. Artificial intelligence-based methods are proposed to handle the problems to diagnose MID on the ECG signals automatically. Hence, in this survey paper, artificial intelligence-based methods, including machine learning and deep learning, are review for MID diagnosis on the ECG signals. Using the methods demonstrate that the feature extraction and selection of ECG signals required to be handcrafted in the ML methods. In contrast, these tasks are explored automatically in the DL methods. Based on our best knowledge, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) methods are highly required methods developed for the early diagnosis of MID on the ECG signals. Most researchers have tended to use DCNN methods, and no studies have surveyed using artificial intelligence methods for MID diagnosis on the ECG signals.

**Abstract:** Session-based recommendation (SBR) learns users' preferences by capturing the short-term and sequential patterns from the evolution of user behaviors. Among the studies in the SBR field, graph-based approaches are a relatively powerful kind of way, which generally extract item information by message aggregation under Euclidean space. However, such methods can't effectively extract the hierarchical information contained among consecutive items in a session, which is critical to represent users' preferences. In this paper, we present a hyperbolic contrastive graph recommender (HCGR), a principled session-based recommendation framework involving Lorentz hyperbolic space to adequately capture the coherence and hierarchical representations of the items. Within this framework, we design a novel adaptive hyperbolic attention computation to aggregate the graph message of each user's preference in a session-based behavior sequence. In addition, contrastive learning is leveraged to optimize the item representation by considering the geodesic distance between positive and negative samples in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that HCGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 0.43$\%$-28.84$\%$ in terms of $HitRate$, $NDCG$ and $MRR$.

**Abstract:** We introduce the Particle Convolution Network (PCN), a new type of equivariant neural network layer suitable for many tasks in jet physics. The particle convolution layer can be viewed as an extension of Deep Sets and Energy Flow network architectures, in which the permutation-invariant operator is promoted to a group convolution. While the PCN can be implemented for various kinds of symmetries, we consider the specific case of rotation about the jet axis the $Î·- Ï$ plane. In two standard benchmark tasks, q/g tagging and top tagging, we show that the rotational PCN (rPCN) achieves performance comparable to graph networks such as ParticleNet. Moreover, we show that it is possible to implement an IRC-safe rPCN, which significantly outperforms existing IRC-safe tagging methods on both tasks. We speculate that by generalizing the PCN to include additional convolutional symmetries relevant to jet physics, it may outperform the current state-of-the-art set by graph networks, while offering a new degree of control over physically-motivated inductive biases.

**Abstract:** SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19 continues to cause an ongoing global pandemic. Therapeutics are still needed to treat mild and severe COVID-19. Drug repurposing provides an opportunity to deploy drugs for COVID-19 more rapidly than developing novel therapeutics. Some existing drugs have shown promise for treating COVID-19 in clinical trials. This in silico study uses structural similarity to clinical trial drugs to identify two drugs with potential applications to treat early COVID-19. We apply in silico validation to suggest a possible mechanism of action for both. Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid structurally similar to Dexamethasone. Gallopamil is a calcium channel blocker structurally similar to Verapamil. We propose that both these drugs could be useful to treat early COVID-19 infection due to the proximity of their targets within a SARS-CoV-2-induced protein-protein interaction network to kinases active in early infection, and the APOA1 protein which is linked to the spread of COVID-19.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we consider the Gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization problem in a non-stationary environment. To capture external changes, the black-box function is allowed to be time-varying within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). To this end, we develop WGP-UCB, a novel UCB-type algorithm based on weighted Gaussian process regression. A key challenge is how to cope with infinite-dimensional feature maps. To that end, we leverage kernel approximation techniques to prove a sublinear regret bound, which is the first (frequentist) sublinear regret guarantee on weighted time-varying bandits with general nonlinear rewards. This result generalizes both non-stationary linear bandits and standard GP-UCB algorithms. Further, a novel concentration inequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with general weights. We also provide universal upper bounds and weight-dependent upper bounds for weighted maximum information gains. These results are potentially of independent interest for applications such as news ranking and adaptive pricing, where weights can be adopted to capture the importance or quality of data. Finally, we conduct experiments to highlight the favorable gains of the proposed algorithm in many cases when compared to existing methods.

**Abstract:** Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) in urban traffic networks poses a challenging task due to the complicated dynamics arising in traffic systems. In recent years, several approaches based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied experimentally. These approaches propose distributed techniques in which each signalized intersection is seen as an agent in a stochastic game whose purpose is to optimize the flow of vehicles in its vicinity. In this setting, the systems evolves towards an equilibrium among the agents that shows beneficial for the whole traffic network. A recently developed multi-agent variant of the well-established advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm, called MA2C (multi-agent A2C) exploits the promising idea of some communication among the agents. In this view,the agents share their strategies with other neighbor agents, thereby stabilizing the learning process even when the agents grow in number and variety. We experimented MA2C in two traffic networks located in Bologna (Italy) and found that its action translates into a significant decrease of the amount of pollutants released into the environment.

**Abstract:** When a robot performs a task next to a human, physical interaction is inevitable: the human might push, pull, twist, or guide the robot. The state-of-the-art treats these interactions as disturbances that the robot should reject or avoid. At best, these robots respond safely while the human interacts; but after the human lets go, these robots simply return to their original behavior. We recognize that physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is often intentional -- the human intervenes on purpose because the robot is not doing the task correctly. In this paper, we argue that when pHRI is intentional it is also informative: the robot can leverage interactions to learn how it should complete the rest of its current task even after the person lets go. We formalize pHRI as a dynamical system, where the human has in mind an objective function they want the robot to optimize, but the robot does not get direct access to the parameters of this objective -- they are internal to the human. Within our proposed framework human interactions become observations about the true objective. We introduce approximations to learn from and respond to pHRI in real-time. We recognize that not all human corrections are perfect: often users interact with the robot noisily, and so we improve the efficiency of robot learning from pHRI by reducing unintended learning. Finally, we conduct simulations and user studies on a robotic manipulator to compare our proposed approach to the state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that learning from pHRI leads to better task performance and improved human satisfaction.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of training robust and accurate deep neural networks (DNNs) when subject to various proportions of noisy labels. Large-scale datasets tend to contain mislabeled samples that can be memorized by DNNs, impeding the performance. With appropriate handling, this degradation can be alleviated. There are two problems to consider: how to distinguish clean samples and how to deal with noisy samples. In this paper, we present Ensemble Noise-robust K-fold Cross-Validation Selection (E-NKCVS) to effectively select clean samples from noisy data, solving the first problem. For the second problem, we create a new pseudo label for any sample determined to have an uncertain or likely corrupt label. E-NKCVS obtains multiple predicted labels for each sample and the entropy of these labels is used to tune the weight given to the pseudo label and the given label. Theoretical analysis and extensive verification of the algorithms in the noisy label setting are provided. We evaluate our approach on various image and text classification tasks where the labels have been manually corrupted with different noise ratios. Additionally, two large real-world noisy datasets are also used, Clothing-1M and WebVision. E-NKCVS is empirically shown to be highly tolerant to considerable proportions of label noise and has a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Especially on more difficult datasets with higher noise ratios, we can achieve a significant improvement over the second-best model. Moreover, our proposed approach can easily be integrated into existing DNN methods to improve their robustness against label noise.

**Abstract:** With the FDA approval of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for point-of-care clinical diagnoses, model generalizability is of the utmost importance as clinical decision-making must be domain-agnostic. A method of tackling the problem is to increase the dataset to include images from a multitude of domains; while this technique is ideal, the security requirements of medical data is a major limitation. Additionally, researchers with developed tools benefit from the addition of open-sourced data, but are limited by the difference in domains. Herewith, we investigated the implementation of a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for the domain adaptation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes. This study was done in collaboration with the Biomedical Optics Research Group and Functional & Anatomical Imaging & Shape Analysis Lab at Simon Fraser University. In this study, we investigated a learning-based approach of adapting the domain of a publicly available dataset, UK Biobank dataset (UKB). To evaluate the performance of domain adaptation, we utilized pre-existing retinal layer segmentation tools developed on a different set of RETOUCH OCT data. This study provides insight on state-of-the-art tools for domain adaptation compared to traditional processing techniques as well as a pipeline for adapting publicly available retinal data to the domains previously used by our collaborators.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes an artificial neural network to determine orientation using polarized skylight. This neural network has specific dilated convolution, which can extract light intensity information of different polarization directions. Then, the degree of polarization (DOP) and angle of polarization (AOP) are directly extracted in the network. In addition, the exponential function encoding of orientation is designed as the network output, which can better reflect the insect's encoding of polarization information, and improve the accuracy of orientation determination. Finally, training and testing were conducted on a public polarized skylight navigation dataset, and the experimental results proved the stability and effectiveness of the network.

**Abstract:** Avoiding unseen or partially occluded vulnerable road users (VRUs) is a major challenge for fully autonomous driving in urban scenes. However, occlusion-aware risk assessment systems have not been widely studied. Here, we propose a pedestrian emergence estimation and occlusion-aware risk assessment system for urban autonomous driving. First, the proposed system utilizes available contextual information, such as visible cars and pedestrians, to estimate pedestrian emergence probabilities in occluded regions. These probabilities are then used in a risk assessment framework, and incorporated into a longitudinal motion controller. The proposed controller is tested against several baseline controllers that recapitulate some commonly observed driving styles. The simulated test scenarios include randomly placed parked cars and pedestrians, most of whom are occluded from the ego vehicle's view and emerges randomly. The proposed controller outperformed the baselines in terms of safety and comfort measures.

**Abstract:** Minimally invasive surgery is a surgical intervention used to examine the organs inside the abdomen and has been widely used due to its effectiveness over open surgery. Due to the hardware improvements such as high definition cameras, this procedure has significantly improved and new software methods have demonstrated potential for computer-assisted procedures. However, there exists challenges and requirements to improve detection and tracking of the position of the instruments during these surgical procedures. To this end, we evaluate and compare some popular deep learning methods that can be explored for the automated segmentation of surgical instruments in laparoscopy, an important step towards tool tracking. Our experimental results exhibit that the Dual decoder attention network (DDANet) produces a superior result compared to other recent deep learning methods. DDANet yields a Dice coefficient of 0.8739 and mean intersection-over-union of 0.8183 for the Robust Medical Instrument Segmentation (ROBUST-MIS) Challenge 2019 dataset, at a real-time speed of 101.36 frames-per-second that is critical for such procedures.

**Abstract:** Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters that detached from input or output layers of underlying subnetworks, potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10-100 compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role for thinner subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow for pruning [Tanaka et al., 2020]. In this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new and more appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization [Su et al., 2020]. In response to this observation, using a simple analogy of pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from physics, we design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random pruning.

**Abstract:** The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in the manufacturing domain enables higher production efficiency, outstanding performance, and safer operations, leveraging powerful tools such as deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques. Despite the high accuracy of these models, they are mostly considered black boxes: they are unintelligible to the human. Opaqueness affects trust in the system, a factor that is critical in the context of decision-making. We present an overview of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques as a means of boosting the transparency of models. We analyze different metrics to evaluate these techniques and describe several application scenarios in the manufacturing domain.

**Abstract:** The universe is composed of galaxies that have diverse shapes. Once the structure of a galaxy is determined, it is possible to obtain important information about its formation and evolution. Morphologically classifying galaxies means cataloging them according to their visual appearance and the classification is linked to the physical properties of the galaxy. A morphological classification made through visual inspection is subject to biases introduced by subjective observations made by human volunteers. For this reason, systematic, objective and easily reproducible classification of galaxies has been gaining importance since the astronomer Edwin Hubble created his famous classification method. In this work, we combine accurate visual classifications of the Galaxy Zoo project with \emph {Deep Learning} methods. The goal is to find an efficient technique at human performance level classification, but in a systematic and automatic way, for classification of elliptical and spiral galaxies. For this, a neural network model was created through an Ensemble of four other convolutional models, allowing a greater accuracy in the classification than what would be obtained with any one individual. Details of the individual models and improvements made are also described. The present work is entirely based on the analysis of images (not parameter tables) from DR1 (www.datalab.noao.edu) of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). In terms of classification, we achieved, with the Ensemble, an accuracy of $\approx 99 \%$ in the test sample (using pre-trained networks).

**Abstract:** Sarcasm detection is the task of identifying irony containing utterances in sentiment-bearing text. However, the figurative and creative nature of sarcasm poses a great challenge for affective computing systems performing sentiment analysis. This article compiles and reviews the salient work in the literature of automatic sarcasm detection. Thus far, three main paradigm shifts have occurred in the way researchers have approached this task: 1) semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, 2) use of hashtag-based supervision, and 3) incorporation of context beyond target text. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in sarcasm and irony detection.

**Abstract:** We introduce the problem of sleeping dueling bandits with stochastic preferences and adversarial availabilities (DB-SPAA). In almost all dueling bandit applications, the decision space often changes over time; eg, retail store management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, search engine optimization, etc. Surprisingly, this `sleeping aspect' of dueling bandits has never been studied in the literature. Like dueling bandits, the goal is to compete with the best arm by sequentially querying the preference feedback of item pairs. The non-triviality however results due to the non-stationary item spaces that allow any arbitrary subsets items to go unavailable every round. The goal is to find an optimal `no-regret' policy that can identify the best available item at each round, as opposed to the standard `fixed best-arm regret objective' of dueling bandits. We first derive an instance-specific lower bound for DB-SPAA $Î©( \sum_{i =1}^{K-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^K \frac{\log T}{Î(i,j)})$, where $K$ is the number of items and $Î(i,j)$ is the gap between items $i$ and $j$. This indicates that the sleeping problem with preference feedback is inherently more difficult than that for classical multi-armed bandits (MAB). We then propose two algorithms, with near optimal regret guarantees. Our results are corroborated empirically.

**Abstract:** Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for automatic speech recognition (ASR). When using appropriate modeling units, e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen during training, e.g., named entities, numbers or technical terms. To alleviate this problem we supplement an end-to-end ASR system with a word/phrase memory and a mechanism to access this memory to recognize the words and phrases correctly. After the training of the ASR system, and when it has already been deployed, a relevant word can be added or subtracted instantly without the need for further training. In this paper we demonstrate that through this mechanism our system is able to recognize more than 85% of newly added words that it previously failed to recognize compared to a strong baseline.

**Abstract:** Density ratio estimation serves as an important technique in the unsupervised machine learning toolbox. However, such ratios are difficult to estimate for complex, high-dimensional data, particularly when the densities of interest are sufficiently different. In our work, we propose to leverage an invertible generative model to map the two distributions into a common feature space prior to estimation. This featurization brings the densities closer together in latent space, sidestepping pathological scenarios where the learned density ratios in input space can be arbitrarily inaccurate. At the same time, the invertibility of our feature map guarantees that the ratios computed in feature space are equivalent to those in input space. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of downstream tasks that require access to accurate density ratios such as mutual information estimation, targeted sampling in deep generative models, and classification with data augmentation.

**Abstract:** Relevance vector machine (RVM) is a popular sparse Bayesian learning model typically used for prediction. Recently it has been shown that improper priors assumed on multiple penalty parameters in RVM may lead to an improper posterior. Currently in the literature, the sufficient conditions for posterior propriety of RVM do not allow improper priors over the multiple penalty parameters. In this article, we propose a single penalty relevance vector machine (SPRVM) model in which multiple penalty parameters are replaced by a single penalty and we consider a semi Bayesian approach for fitting the SPRVM. The necessary and sufficient conditions for posterior propriety of SPRVM are more liberal than those of RVM and allow for several improper priors over the penalty parameter. Additionally, we also prove the geometric ergodicity of the Gibbs sampler used to analyze the SPRVM model and hence can estimate the asymptotic standard errors associated with the Monte Carlo estimate of the means of the posterior predictive distribution. Such a Monte Carlo standard error cannot be computed in the case of RVM, since the rate of convergence of the Gibbs sampler used to analyze RVM is not known. The predictive performance of RVM and SPRVM is compared by analyzing three real life datasets.

**Abstract:** Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference of target posterior distributions in machine learning is predominately conducted via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and its variants. This is due to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo based samplers ability to suppress random-walk behaviour. As with other Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo produces auto-correlated samples which results in high variance in the estimators, and low effective sample size rates in the generated samples. Adding antithetic sampling to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has been previously shown to produce higher effective sample rates compared to vanilla Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In this paper, we present new algorithms which are antithetic versions of Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Quantum-Inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm improves on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo by taking into account the local geometry of the target, which is beneficial for target densities that may exhibit strong correlations in the parameters. Quantum-Inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is based on quantum particles that can have random mass. Quantum-Inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo uses a random mass matrix which results in better sampling than Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on spiky and multi-modal distributions such as jump diffusion processes. The analysis is performed on jump diffusion process using real world financial market data, as well as on real world benchmark classification tasks using Bayesian logistic regression.

**Abstract:** In today's networked society, many real-world problems can be formalized as predicting links in networks, such as Facebook friendship suggestions, e-commerce recommendations, and the prediction of scientific collaborations in citation networks. Increasingly often, link prediction problem is tackled by means of network embedding methods, owing to their state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods lack transparency when compared to simpler baselines, and as a result their robustness against adversarial attacks is a possible point of concern: could one or a few small adversarial modifications to the network have a large impact on the link prediction performance when using a network embedding model? Prior research has already investigated adversarial robustness for network embedding models, focused on classification at the node and graph level. Robustness with respect to the link prediction downstream task, on the other hand, has been explored much less.
  This paper contributes to filling this gap, by studying adversarial robustness of Conditional Network Embedding (CNE), a state-of-the-art probabilistic network embedding model, for link prediction. More specifically, given CNE and a network, we measure the sensitivity of the link predictions of the model to small adversarial perturbations of the network, namely changes of the link status of a node pair. Thus, our approach allows one to identify the links and non-links in the network that are most vulnerable to such perturbations, for further investigation by an analyst. We analyze the characteristics of the most and least sensitive perturbations, and empirically confirm that our approach not only succeeds in identifying the most vulnerable links and non-links, but also that it does so in a time-efficient manner thanks to an effective approximation.

**Abstract:** Android malware is one of the most dangerous threats on the internet, and it's been on the rise for several years. Despite significant efforts in detecting and classifying android malware from innocuous android applications, there is still a long way to go. As a result, there is a need to provide a basic understanding of the behavior displayed by the most common Android malware categories and families. Each Android malware family and category has a distinct objective. As a result, it has impacted every corporate area, including healthcare, banking, transportation, government, and e-commerce. In this paper, we presented two machine-learning approaches for Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware: one for detecting and identifying Android Malware Categories and the other for detecting and identifying Android Malware Families, which was accomplished by analyzing a massive malware dataset with 14 prominent malware categories and 180 prominent malware families of CCCS-CIC-AndMal2020 dataset on Dynamic Layers. Our approach achieves in Android Malware Category detection more than 96 % accurate and achieves in Android Malware Family detection more than 99% accurate. Our approach provides a method for high-accuracy Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware while also shortening the time required to analyze smartphone malware.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes an invariant causal predictor that is robust to distribution shift across domains and maximally reserves the transferable invariant information. Based on a disentangled causal factorization, we formulate the distribution shift as soft interventions in the system, which covers a wide range of cases for distribution shift as we do not make prior specifications on the causal structure or the intervened variables. Instead of imposing regularizations to constrain the invariance of the predictor, we propose to predict by the intervened conditional expectation based on the do-operator and then prove that it is invariant across domains. More importantly, we prove that the proposed predictor is the robust predictor that minimizes the worst-case quadratic loss among the distributions of all domains. For empirical learning, we propose an intuitive and flexible estimating method based on data regeneration and present a local causal discovery procedure to guide the regeneration step. The key idea is to regenerate data such that the regenerated distribution is compatible with the intervened graph, which allows us to incorporate standard supervised learning methods with the regenerated data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficacy of our predictor in improving the predictive accuracy and robustness across domains.

**Abstract:** Deployed machine learning models are confronted with the problem of changing data over time, a phenomenon also called concept drift. While existing approaches of concept drift detection already show convincing results, they require true labels as a prerequisite for successful drift detection. Especially in many real-world application scenarios-like the ones covered in this work-true labels are scarce, and their acquisition is expensive. Therefore, we introduce a new algorithm for drift detection, Uncertainty Drift Detection (UDD), which is able to detect drifts without access to true labels. Our approach is based on the uncertainty estimates provided by a deep neural network in combination with Monte Carlo Dropout. Structural changes over time are detected by applying the ADWIN technique on the uncertainty estimates, and detected drifts trigger a retraining of the prediction model. In contrast to input data-based drift detection, our approach considers the effects of the current input data on the properties of the prediction model rather than detecting change on the input data only (which can lead to unnecessary retrainings). We show that UDD outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies on two synthetic as well as ten real-world data sets for both regression and classification tasks.

**Abstract:** As pairwise ranking becomes broadly employed for elections, sports competitions, recommendations, and so on, attackers have strong motivation and incentives to manipulate the ranking list. They could inject malicious comparisons into the training data to fool the victim. Such a technique is called poisoning attack in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we initiate the first systematic investigation of data poisoning attacks on pairwise ranking algorithms, which can be formalized as the dynamic and static games between the ranker and the attacker and can be modeled as certain kinds of integer programming problems. To break the computational hurdle of the underlying integer programming problems, we reformulate them into the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems, which are computationally tractable. Based on such DRO formulations, we propose two efficient poisoning attack algorithms and establish the associated theoretical guarantees. The effectiveness of the suggested poisoning attack strategies is demonstrated by a series of toy simulations and several real data experiments. These experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the performance of the ranker in the sense that the correlation between the true ranking list and the aggregated results can be decreased dramatically.

**Abstract:** Developing machine learning methods that are privacy preserving is today a central topic of research, with huge practical impacts. Among the numerous ways to address privacy-preserving learning, we here take the perspective of computing the divergences between distributions under the Differential Privacy (DP) framework -- being able to compute divergences between distributions is pivotal for many machine learning problems, such as   learning generative models or domain adaptation problems.  Instead of resorting to the popular gradient-based sanitization method for DP, we tackle the problem at its roots by focusing on the Sliced Wasserstein Distance and seamlessly making it differentially private. Our main contribution is as follows: we analyze the property of adding a Gaussian perturbation  to the intrinsic randomized mechanism of the Sliced Wasserstein Distance, and we establish the sensitivityof the resulting differentially private mechanism. One of our important findings is that this DP mechanism transforms the Sliced Wasserstein distance into another distance, that we call the Smoothed Sliced Wasserstein Distance. This new differentially private distribution distance can be plugged into generative models and domain adaptation algorithms in a transparent way, and we empirically show that  it yields highly competitive performance compared with gradient-based DP approaches from the literature,  with almost no loss in accuracy for the domain adaptation problems that we consider.

**Abstract:** First-price auctions have largely replaced traditional bidding  approaches based on Vickrey auctions in programmatic advertising.  As far as learning is concerned, first-price auctions are more  challenging because the optimal bidding strategy does not only  depend on the value of the item but also requires some knowledge of  the other bids.  They have already given rise to several works in sequential  learning,  many of which consider models for which the value of the buyer or  the opponents' maximal bid is chosen in an adversarial manner. Even  in the simplest settings, this gives rise to algorithms whose regret  grows as $\sqrt{T}$ with respect to the time horizon $T$.  Focusing on the case where the buyer plays against a stationary  stochastic environment, we show how to achieve significantly lower  regret: when the opponents' maximal bid distribution is known we  provide an algorithm whose regret can be as low as $\log^2(T)$; in  the case where the distribution must be learnt sequentially, a  generalization of this algorithm can achieve $T^{1/3+ Îµ}$  regret, for any $Îµ>0$.  To obtain these results, we introduce two novel ideas that can be of  interest in their own right. First, by transposing results obtained  in the posted price setting, we provide conditions under which the  first-price biding utility is locally quadratic around its  optimum. Second, we leverage the observation that, on small  sub-intervals, the concentration of the variations of the empirical  distribution function may be controlled more accurately than by  using the classical Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality.  Numerical simulations confirm that our algorithms converge much  faster than alternatives proposed in the literature for various bid  distributions, including for bids collected on an actual  programmatic advertising platform.

**Abstract:** Despite the empirical success of deep learning, it still lacks theoretical understandings to explain why randomly initialized neural network trained by first-order optimization methods is able to achieve zero training loss, even though its landscape is non-convex and non-smooth. Recently, there are some works to demystifies this phenomenon under over-parameterized regime. In this work, we make further progress on this area by considering a commonly used momentum optimization algorithm: Nesterov accelerated method (NAG). We analyze the convergence of NAG for two-layer fully connected neural network with ReLU activation. Specifically, we prove that the error of NAG converges to zero at a linear convergence rate $1-Î(1/\sqrtÎº)$, where $Îº> 1$ is determined by the initialization and the architecture of neural network. Comparing to the rate $1-Î(1/Îº)$ of gradient descent, NAG achieves an acceleration. Besides, it also validates NAG and Heavy-ball method can achieve a similar convergence rate.

**Abstract:** Relational databases are the de facto standard for storing and querying structured data, and extracting insights from structured data requires advanced analytics. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved super-human prediction performance in particular data types, e.g., images. However, existing DNNs may not produce meaningful results when applied to structured data. The reason is that there are correlations and dependencies across combinations of attribute values in a table, and these do not follow simple additive patterns that can be easily mimicked by a DNN. The number of possible such cross features is combinatorial, making them computationally prohibitive to model. Furthermore, the deployment of learning models in real-world applications has also highlighted the need for interpretability, especially for high-stakes applications, which remains another issue of concern to DNNs.
  In this paper, we present ARM-Net, an adaptive relation modeling network tailored for structured data, and a lightweight framework ARMOR based on ARM-Net for relational data analytics. The key idea is to model feature interactions with cross features selectively and dynamically, by first transforming the input features into exponential space, and then determining the interaction order and interaction weights adaptively for each cross feature. We propose a novel sparse attention mechanism to dynamically generate the interaction weights given the input tuple, so that we can explicitly model cross features of arbitrary orders with noisy features filtered selectively. Then during model inference, ARM-Net can specify the cross features being used for each prediction for higher accuracy and better interpretability. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ARM-Net consistently outperforms existing models and provides more interpretable predictions for data-driven decision making.

**Abstract:** Transfer-based adversarial attacks can effectively evaluate model robustness in the black-box setting. Though several methods have demonstrated impressive transferability of untargeted adversarial examples, targeted adversarial transferability is still challenging. The existing methods either have low targeted transferability or sacrifice computational efficiency. In this paper, we develop a simple yet practical framework to efficiently craft targeted transfer-based adversarial examples. Specifically, we propose a conditional generative attacking model, which can generate the adversarial examples targeted at different classes by simply altering the class embedding and share a single backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves the success rates of targeted black-box attacks by a significant margin over the existing methods -- it reaches an average success rate of 29.6\% against six diverse models based only on one substitute white-box model in the standard testing of NeurIPS 2017 competition, which outperforms the state-of-the-art gradient-based attack methods (with an average success rate of $<$2\%) by a large margin. Moreover, the proposed method is also more efficient beyond an order of magnitude than gradient-based methods.

**Abstract:** A prominent technique for reducing the memory footprint of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) without decreasing the accuracy significantly is quantization. However, the state-of-the-art only focus on employing the weight quantization directly from a specific quantization scheme, i.e., either the post-training quantization (PTQ) or the in-training quantization (ITQ), and do not consider (1) quantizing other SNN parameters (e.g., neuron membrane potential), (2) exploring different combinations of quantization approaches (i.e., quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes), and (3) selecting the SNN model with a good memory-accuracy trade-off at the end. Therefore, the memory saving offered by these state-of-the-art to meet the targeted accuracy is limited, thereby hindering processing SNNs on the resource-constrained systems (e.g., the IoT-Edge devices). Towards this, we propose Q-SpiNN, a novel quantization framework for memory-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of the Q-SpiNN are: (1) employing quantization for different SNN parameters based on their significance to the accuracy, (2) exploring different combinations of quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes to find efficient SNN model candidates, and (3) developing an algorithm that quantifies the benefit of the memory-accuracy trade-off obtained by the candidates, and selects the Pareto-optimal one. The experimental results show that, for the unsupervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory footprint by ca. 4x, while maintaining the accuracy within 1% from the baseline on the MNIST dataset. For the supervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory by ca. 2x, while keeping the accuracy within 2% from the baseline on the DVS-Gesture dataset.

**Abstract:** Automotive software testing continues to rely largely upon expensive field tests to ensure quality because alternatives like simulation-based testing are relatively immature. As a step towards lowering reliance on field tests, we present SilGAN, a deep generative model that eases specification, stimulus generation, and automation of automotive software-in-the-loop testing. The model is trained using data recorded from vehicles in the field. Upon training, the model uses a concise specification for a driving scenario to generate realistic vehicle state transitions that can occur during such a scenario. Such authentic emulation of internal vehicle behavior can be used for rapid, systematic and inexpensive testing of vehicle control software. In addition, by presenting a targeted method for searching through the information learned by the model, we show how a test objective like code coverage can be automated. The data driven end-to-end testing pipeline that we present vastly expands the scope and credibility of automotive simulation-based testing. This reduces time to market while helping maintain required standards of quality.

**Abstract:** Health records data security is one of the main challenges in e-health systems. Authentication is one of the essential security services to support the stored data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This research focuses on the secure storage of patient and medical records in the healthcare sector where data security and unauthorized access is an ongoing issue. A potential solution comes from biometrics, although their use may be time-consuming and can slow down data retrieval. This research aims to overcome these challenges and enhance data access control in the healthcare sector through the addition of biometrics in the form of fingerprints. The proposed model for application in the healthcare sector consists of Collection, Network communication, and Authentication (CNA) using biometrics, which replaces an existing password-based access control method. A sensor then collects data and by using a network (wireless or Zig-bee), a connection is established, after connectivity analytics and data management work which processes and aggregate the data. Subsequently, access is granted to authenticated users of the application. This IoT-based biometric authentication system facilitates effective recognition and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and reliability of patients, records and other sensitive data. The proposed solution provides reliable access to healthcare data and enables secure access through the process of user and device authentication. The proposed model has been developed for access control to data through the authentication of users in healthcare to reduce data manipulation or theft.

**Abstract:** Measuring soil health indicators is an important and challenging task that affects farmers' decisions on timing, placement, and quantity of fertilizers applied in the farms. Most existing methods to measure soil health indicators (SHIs) are in-lab wet chemistry or spectroscopy-based methods, which require significant human input and effort, time-consuming, costly, and are low-throughput in nature. To address this challenge, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven near real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral sensing (UMS) solution to estimate total nitrogen (TN) of the soil, an important macro-nutrient or SHI that directly affects the crop health. Accurate prediction of soil TN can significantly increase crop yield through informed decision making on the timing of seed planting, and fertilizer quantity and timing. We train two machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron and support vector machine to predict the soil nitrogen using a suite of data classes including multispectral characteristics of the soil and crops in red, near-infrared, and green spectral bands, computed vegetation indices, and environmental variables including air temperature and relative humidity. To generate the ground-truth data or the training data for the machine learning models, we measure the total nitrogen of the soil samples (collected from a farm) using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS).

**Abstract:** The complexity of software tasks and the uncertainty of crowd developer behaviors make it challenging to plan crowdsourced software development (CSD) projects. In a competitive crowdsourcing marketplace, competition for shared worker resources from multiple simultaneously open tasks adds another layer of uncertainty to the potential outcomes of software crowdsourcing. These factors lead to the need for supporting CSD managers with automated scheduling to improve the visibility and predictability of crowdsourcing processes and outcomes. To that end, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm-based task scheduling method for crowdsourced software development. The proposed evolutionary scheduling method uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to recommend an optimal task start date. The method uses three fitness functions, based on project duration, task similarity, and task failure prediction, respectively. The task failure fitness function uses a neural network to predict the probability of task failure with respect to a specific task start date. The proposed method then recommends the best tasks start dates for the project as a whole and each individual task so as to achieve the lowest project failure ratio. Experimental results on 4 projects demonstrate that the proposed method has the potential to reduce project duration by a factor of 33-78%.

**Abstract:** In medical tasks such as human motion analysis, computer-aided auxiliary systems have become preferred choice for human experts for its high efficiency. However, conventional approaches are typically based on user-defined features such as movement onset times, peak velocities, motion vectors or frequency domain analyses. Such approaches entail careful data post-processing or specific domain knowledge to achieve a meaningful feature extraction. Besides, they are prone to noise and the manual-defined features could hardly be re-used for other analyses. In this paper, we proposed probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs), a widely-used approach in robot skill learning, to model human motions. The benefit of ProMPs is that the features are directly learned from the data and ProMPs can capture important features describing the trajectory shape, which can easily be extended to other tasks. Distinct from previous research, where classification tasks are mostly investigated, we applied ProMPs together with a variant of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to quantify the effect of different transcranial current stimulation methods on human motions. We presented an initial result with 10 participants. The results validate ProMPs as a robust and effective feature extractor for human motions.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we analyze the local convergence rate of optimistic mirror descent methods in stochastic variational inequalities, a class of optimization problems with important applications to learning theory and machine learning. Our analysis reveals an intricate relation between the algorithm's rate of convergence and the local geometry induced by the method's underlying Bregman function. We quantify this relation by means of the Legendre exponent, a notion that we introduce to measure the growth rate of the Bregman divergence relative to the ambient norm near a solution. We show that this exponent determines both the optimal step-size policy of the algorithm and the optimal rates attained, explaining in this way the differences observed for some popular Bregman functions (Euclidean projection, negative entropy, fractional power, etc.).

Participants are invited to complete the knowledge graph by predicting missing triplets. Recent representation learning methods have achieved great success on standard datasets like FB15k-237. Thus, we train the advanced algorithms in different domains to learn the triplets, including OTE, QuatE, RotatE and TransE. Significantly, we modified OTE into NOTE (short for Norm-OTE) for better performance. Besides, we use both the DeepWalk and the post-smoothing technique to capture the graph structure for supplementation. In addition to the representations, we also use various statistical probabilities among the head entities, the relations and the tail entities for the final prediction. Experimental results show that the ensemble of state-of-the-art representation learning methods could draw on each others strengths. And we develop feature engineering from validation candidates for further improvements. Please note that we apply the same strategy on the test set for final inference. And these features may not be practical in the real world when considering ranking against all the entities.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a teleoperation system that includes robot perception and intent prediction from hand gestures. The perception module identifies the objects present in the robot workspace and the intent prediction module which object the user likely wants to grasp. This architecture allows the approach to rely on traded control instead of direct control: we use hand gestures to specify the goal objects for a sequential manipulation task, the robot then autonomously generates a grasping or a retrieving motion using trajectory optimization. The perception module relies on the model-based tracker to precisely track the 6D pose of the objects and makes use of a state of the art learning-based object detection and segmentation method, to initialize the tracker by automatically detecting objects in the scene. Goal objects are identified from user hand gestures using a trained a multi-layer perceptron classifier. After presenting all the components of the system and their empirical evaluation, we present experimental results comparing our pipeline to a direct traded control approach (i.e., one that does not use prediction) which shows that using intent prediction allows to bring down the overall task execution time.

**Abstract:** Although cyberattacks on machine learning (ML) production systems can be harmful, today, security practitioners are ill equipped, lacking methodologies and tactical tools that would allow them to analyze the security risks of their ML-based systems. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive threat analysis of ML production systems. In this analysis, we follow the ontology presented by NIST for evaluating enterprise network security risk and apply it to ML-based production systems. Specifically, we (1) enumerate the assets of a typical ML production system, (2) describe the threat model (i.e., potential adversaries, their capabilities, and their main goal), (3) identify the various threats to ML systems, and (4) review a large number of attacks, demonstrated in previous studies, which can realize these threats. In addition, to quantify the risk of adversarial machine learning (AML) threat, we introduce a novel scoring system, which assign a severity score to different AML attacks. The proposed scoring system utilizes the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for ranking, with the assistance of security experts, various attributes of the attacks. Finally, we developed an extension to the MulVAL attack graph generation and analysis framework to incorporate cyberattacks on ML production systems. Using the extension, security practitioners can apply attack graph analysis methods in environments that include ML components; thus, providing security practitioners with a methodological and practical tool for evaluating the impact and quantifying the risk of a cyberattack targeting an ML production system.

**Abstract:** Random dimensionality reduction is a versatile tool for speeding up algorithms for high-dimensional problems. We study its application to two clustering problems: the facility location problem, and the single-linkage hierarchical clustering problem, which is equivalent to computing the minimum spanning tree. We show that if we project the input pointset $X$ onto a random $d = O(d_X)$-dimensional subspace (where $d_X$ is the doubling dimension of $X$), then the optimum facility location cost in the projected space approximates the original cost up to a constant factor. We show an analogous statement for minimum spanning tree, but with the dimension $d$ having an extra $\log \log n$ term and the approximation factor being arbitrarily close to $1$. Furthermore, we extend these results to approximating solutions instead of just their costs. Lastly, we provide experimental results to validate the quality of solutions and the speedup due to the dimensionality reduction. Unlike several previous papers studying this approach in the context of $k$-means and $k$-medians, our dimension bound does not depend on the number of clusters but only on the intrinsic dimensionality of $X$.

**Abstract:** A fundamental problem when aggregating Markov chains is the specification of the number of state groups. Too few state groups may fail to sufficiently capture the pertinent dynamics of the original, high-order Markov chain. Too many state groups may lead to a non-parsimonious, reduced-order Markov chain whose complexity rivals that of the original. In this paper, we show that an augmented value-of-information-based approach to aggregating Markov chains facilitates the determination of the number of state groups. The optimal state-group count coincides with the case where the complexity of the reduced-order chain is balanced against the mutual dependence between the original- and reduced-order chain dynamics.

For this, we align invasively obtained eye fundus contrast images (the "golden standard" diagnostic) to the RGB ones and use them to hand-annotate the lesions.

Using the data, we train and test five different convolutional neural networks: a custom one to classify healthy and AMD-affected eye fundi, and four well-known networks: ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNetV3, and UNet to segment (localize) the AMD lesions in the affected eye fundus images. We achieve 93.55% accuracy or 69.71% Dice index as the preliminary best results in segmentation with MobileNetV3.

**Abstract:** Though recent works have developed methods that can generate estimates (or imputations)of the missing entries in a dataset to facilitate downstream analysis, most depend onassumptions that may not align with real-world applications and could suffer from poorperformance in subsequent tasks such as classification. This is particularly true if the datahave large missingness rates or a small sample size. More importantly, the imputationerror could be propagated into the prediction step that follows, which may constrain thecapabilities of the prediction model. In this work, we introduce the gradient importancelearning (GIL) method to train multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and long short-term memo-ries (LSTMs) todirectlyperform inference from inputs containing missing valueswithoutimputation. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to adjust the gradientsused to train these models via back-propagation. This allows the model to exploit theunderlying information behindmissingness patterns. We test the approach on real-worldtime-series (i.e., MIMIC-III), tabular data obtained from an eye clinic, and a standarddataset (i.e., MNIST), where ourimputation-freepredictions outperform the traditionaltwo-stepimputation-based predictions using state-of-the-art imputation methods.

**Abstract:** LIGO is considered the most sensitive and complicated gravitational experiment ever built. Its main objective is to detect the gravitational wave from the strongest events in the universe by observing if the length of its 4-kilometer arms change by a distance 10,000 times smaller than the diameter of a proton. Due to its sensitivity, LIGO is prone to the disturbance of external noises which affects the data being collected to detect the gravitational wave. These noises are commonly called by the LIGO community as glitches. The general objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of various deep transfer learning models namely ResNet101, ResNet101V2, ResNet152, ResNet50, ResNet50v2, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionResnetV2, and DenseNet169 in glitch waveform detection in gravitational-wave data. The model VGG19 recorded the hight AUC-ROC with 98.98%. On the other hand, ResNet152 recorded the lowest AUC-ROC of 93.954% which performs poorly in identifying almost half of the classes in the dataset. It is also observed that less complex model like VGG19,DenseNet169 and VGG16 performs better than most of the more complex models which might indicate that less complex models might be preferred when identifying glitch waveforms.

**Abstract:** Pricing decisions are increasingly made by AI. Thanks to their ability to train with live market data while making decisions on the fly, deep reinforcement learning algorithms are especially effective in taking such pricing decisions. In e-commerce scenarios, multiple reinforcement learning agents can set prices based on their competitor's prices. Therefore, research states that agents might end up in a state of collusion in the long run. To further analyze this issue, we build a scenario that is based on a modified version of a prisoner's dilemma where three agents play the game of rock paper scissors. Our results indicate that the action selection can be dissected into specific stages, establishing the possibility to develop collusion prevention systems that are able to recognize situations which might lead to a collusion between competitors. We furthermore provide evidence for a situation where agents are capable of performing a tacit cooperation strategy without being explicitly trained to do so.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a Grasp Manifold Estimator (GraspME) to detect grasp affordances for objects directly in 2D camera images. To perform manipulation tasks autonomously it is crucial for robots to have such graspability models of the surrounding objects. Grasp manifolds have the advantage of providing continuously infinitely many grasps, which is not the case when using other grasp representations such as predefined grasp points. For instance, this property can be leveraged in motion optimization to define goal sets as implicit surface constraints in the robot configuration space. In this work, we restrict ourselves to the case of estimating possible end-effector positions directly from 2D camera images. To this extend, we define grasp manifolds via a set of key points and locate them in images using a Mask R-CNN backbone. Using learned features allows generalizing to different view angles, with potentially noisy images, and objects that were not part of the training set. We rely on simulation data only and perform experiments on simple and complex objects, including unseen ones. Our framework achieves an inference speed of 11.5 fps on a GPU, an average precision for keypoint estimation of 94.5% and a mean pixel distance of only 1.29. This shows that we can estimate the objects very well via bounding boxes and segmentation masks as well as approximate the correct grasp manifold's keypoint coordinates.
