**Abstract:** It is well-known that modern neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. To mitigate this problem, a series of robust learning algorithms have been proposed. However, although the robust training error can be near zero via some methods, all existing algorithms lead to a high robust generalization error. In this paper, we provide a theoretical understanding of this puzzling phenomenon from the perspective of expressive power for deep neural networks. Specifically, for binary classification problems with well-separated data, we show that, for ReLU networks, while mild over-parameterization is sufficient for high robust training accuracy, there exists a constant robust generalization gap unless the size of the neural network is exponential in the data dimension $d$. Even if the data is linear separable, which means achieving low clean generalization error is easy, we can still prove an $\exp(Ω(d))$ lower bound for robust generalization. Moreover, we establish an improved upper bound of $\exp({\mathcal{O}}(k))$ for the network size to achieve low robust generalization error when the data lies on a manifold with intrinsic dimension $k$ ($k \ll d$). Nonetheless, we also have a lower bound that grows exponentially with respect to $k$ -- the curse of dimensionality is inevitable. By demonstrating an exponential separation between the network size for achieving low robust training and generalization error, our results reveal that the hardness of robust generalization may stem from the expressive power of practical models.

**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performances but are typically over-parameterized. The over-parameterization may result in undesirably large generalization error in the absence of other customized training strategies. Recently, a line of research under the name of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown that minimizing a sharpness measure, which reflects the geometry of the loss landscape, can significantly reduce the generalization error. However, SAM-like methods incur a two-fold computational overhead of the given base optimizer (e.g. SGD) for approximating the sharpness measure. In this paper, we propose Sharpness-Aware Training for Free, or SAF, which mitigates the sharp landscape at almost zero additional computational cost over the base optimizer. Intuitively, SAF achieves this by avoiding sudden drops in the loss in the sharp local minima throughout the trajectory of the updates of the weights. Specifically, we suggest a novel trajectory loss, based on the KL-divergence between the outputs of DNNs with the current weights and past weights, as a replacement of the SAM's sharpness measure. This loss captures the rate of change of the training loss along the model's update trajectory. By minimizing it, SAF ensures the convergence to a flat minimum with improved generalization capabilities. Extensive empirical results show that SAF minimizes the sharpness in the same way that SAM does, yielding better results on the ImageNet dataset with essentially the same computational cost as the base optimizer.

**Abstract:** A significant gap remains between today's visual pattern recognition models and human-level visual cognition especially when it comes to few-shot learning and compositional reasoning of novel concepts. We introduce Bongard-HOI, a new visual reasoning benchmark that focuses on compositional learning of human-object interactions (HOIs) from natural images. It is inspired by two desirable characteristics from the classical Bongard problems (BPs): 1) few-shot concept learning, and 2) context-dependent reasoning. We carefully curate the few-shot instances with hard negatives, where positive and negative images only disagree on action labels, making mere recognition of object categories insufficient to complete our benchmarks. We also design multiple test sets to systematically study the generalization of visual learning models, where we vary the overlap of the HOI concepts between the training and test sets of few-shot instances, from partial to no overlaps. Bongard-HOI presents a substantial challenge to today's visual recognition models. The state-of-the-art HOI detection model achieves only 62% accuracy on few-shot binary prediction while even amateur human testers on MTurk have 91% accuracy. With the Bongard-HOI benchmark, we hope to further advance research efforts in visual reasoning, especially in holistic perception-reasoning systems and better representation learning.

**Abstract:** Masked image modeling (MIM) learns representations with remarkably good fine-tuning performances, overshadowing previous prevalent pre-training approaches such as image classification, instance contrastive learning, and image-text alignment. In this paper, we show that the inferior fine-tuning performance of these pre-training approaches can be significantly improved by a simple post-processing in the form of feature distillation (FD). The feature distillation converts the old representations to new representations that have a few desirable properties just like those representations produced by MIM. These properties, which we aggregately refer to as optimization friendliness, are identified and analyzed by a set of attention- and optimization-related diagnosis tools. With these properties, the new representations show strong fine-tuning performance. Specifically, the contrastive self-supervised learning methods are made as competitive in fine-tuning as the state-of-the-art masked image modeling (MIM) algorithms. The CLIP models' fine-tuning performance is also significantly improved, with a CLIP ViT-L model reaching 89.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification. More importantly, our work provides a way for the future research to focus more effort on the generality and scalability of the learnt representations without being pre-occupied with optimization friendliness since it can be enhanced rather easily. The code will be available at https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Feature-Distillation.

**Abstract:** Due to the widespread use of complex machine learning models in real-world applications, it is becoming critical to explain model predictions. However, these models are typically black-box deep neural networks, explained post-hoc via methods with known faithfulness limitations. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are an inherently interpretable class of models that address this limitation by learning a non-linear shape function for each feature separately, followed by a linear model on top. However, these models are typically difficult to train, require numerous parameters, and are difficult to scale.
  We propose an entirely new subfamily of GAMs that utilizes basis decomposition of shape functions. A small number of basis functions are shared among all features, and are learned jointly for a given task, thus making our model scale much better to large-scale data with high-dimensional features, especially when features are sparse. We propose an architecture denoted as the Neural Basis Model (NBM) which uses a single neural network to learn these bases. On a variety of tabular and image datasets, we demonstrate that for interpretable machine learning, NBMs are the state-of-the-art in accuracy, model size, and, throughput and can easily model all higher-order feature interactions.

**Abstract:** Vision transformers have become one of the most important models for computer vision tasks. Although they outperform prior works, they require heavy computational resources on a scale that is quadratic to the number of tokens, $N$. This is a major drawback of the traditional self-attention (SA) algorithm. Here, we propose the X-ViT, ViT with a novel SA mechanism that has linear complexity. The main approach of this work is to eliminate nonlinearity from the original SA. We factorize the matrix multiplication of the SA mechanism without complicated linear approximation. By modifying only a few lines of code from the original SA, the proposed models outperform most transformer-based models on image classification and dense prediction tasks on most capacity regimes.

**Abstract:** Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have quickly become the leading choice for fully-interpretable machine learning. However, unlike uninterpretable methods such as DNNs, they lack expressive power and easy scalability, and are hence not a feasible alternative for real-world tasks. We present a new class of GAMs that use tensor rank decompositions of polynomials to learn powerful, $\textit{fully-interpretable}$ models. Our approach, titled Scalable Polynomial Additive Models (SPAM) is effortlessly scalable and models $\textit{all}$ higher-order feature interactions without a combinatorial parameter explosion. SPAM outperforms all current interpretable approaches, and matches DNN/XGBoost performance on a series of real-world benchmarks with up to hundreds of thousands of features. We demonstrate by human subject evaluations that SPAMs are demonstrably more interpretable in practice, and are hence an effortless replacement for DNNs for creating interpretable and high-performance systems suitable for large-scale machine learning.

**Abstract:** Objective. This work investigates the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically perform measurements of fetal body parts, including head circumference, biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference and femur length, and to estimate gestational age and fetal weight using fetal ultrasound videos. Approach. We developed a novel multi-task CNN-based spatio-temporal fetal US feature extraction and standard plane detection algorithm (called FUVAI) and evaluated the method on 50 freehand fetal US video scans. We compared FUVAI fetal biometric measurements with measurements made by five experienced sonographers at two time points separated by at least two weeks. Intra- and inter-observer variabilities were estimated. Main results. We found that automated fetal biometric measurements obtained by FUVAI were comparable to the measurements performed by experienced sonographers The observed differences in measurement values were within the range of inter- and intra-observer variability. Moreover, analysis has shown that these differences were not statistically significant when comparing any individual medical expert to our model. Significance. We argue that FUVAI has the potential to assist sonographers who perform fetal biometric measurements in clinical settings by providing them with suggestions regarding the best measuring frames, along with automated measurements. Moreover, FUVAI is able perform these tasks in just a few seconds, which is a huge difference compared to the average of six minutes taken by sonographers. This is significant, given the shortage of medical experts capable of interpreting fetal ultrasound images in numerous countries.

**Abstract:** We study online learning with bandit feedback across multiple tasks, with the goal of improving average performance across tasks if they are similar according to some natural task-similarity measure. As the first to target the adversarial setting, we design a unified meta-algorithm that yields setting-specific guarantees for two important cases: multi-armed bandits (MAB) and bandit linear optimization (BLO). For MAB, the meta-algorithm tunes the initialization, step-size, and entropy parameter of the Tsallis-entropy generalization of the well-known Exp3 method, with the task-averaged regret provably improving if the entropy of the distribution over estimated optima-in-hindsight is small. For BLO, we learn the initialization, step-size, and boundary-offset of online mirror descent (OMD) with self-concordant barrier regularizers, showing that task-averaged regret varies directly with a measure induced by these functions on the interior of the action space. Our adaptive guarantees rely on proving that unregularized follow-the-leader combined with multiplicative weights is enough to online learn a non-smooth and non-convex sequence of affine functions of Bregman divergences that upper-bound the regret of OMD.

**Abstract:** From logistics to the natural sciences, combinatorial optimisation on graphs underpins numerous real-world applications. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown particular promise in this setting as it can adapt to specific problem structures and does not require pre-solved instances for these, often NP-hard, problems. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches typically suffer from severe scalability issues, primarily due to their reliance on expensive graph neural networks (GNNs) at each decision step. We introduce ECORD; a novel RL algorithm that alleviates this expense by restricting the GNN to a single pre-processing step, before entering a fast-acting exploratory phase directed by a recurrent unit. Experimentally, ECORD achieves a new SOTA for RL algorithms on the Maximum Cut problem, whilst also providing orders of magnitude improvement in speed and scalability. Compared to the nearest competitor, ECORD reduces the optimality gap by up to 73% on 500 vertex graphs with a decreased wall-clock time. Moreover, ECORD retains strong performance when generalising to larger graphs with up to 10000 vertices.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised object-centric learning aims to represent the modular, compositional, and causal structure of a scene as a set of object representations and thereby promises to resolve many critical limitations of traditional single-vector representations such as poor systematic generalization. Although there have been many remarkable advances in recent years, one of the most critical problems in this direction has been that previous methods work only with simple and synthetic scenes but not with complex and naturalistic images or videos. In this paper, we propose STEVE, an unsupervised model for object-centric learning in videos. Our proposed model makes a significant advancement by demonstrating its effectiveness on various complex and naturalistic videos unprecedented in this line of research. Interestingly, this is achieved by neither adding complexity to the model architecture nor introducing a new objective or weak supervision. Rather, it is achieved by a surprisingly simple architecture that uses a transformer-based image decoder conditioned on slots and the learning objective is simply to reconstruct the observation. Our experiment results on various complex and naturalistic videos show significant improvements compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

**Abstract:** Transformers have made progress in miscellaneous tasks, but suffer from quadratic computational and memory complexities. Recent works propose sparse Transformers with attention on sparse graphs to reduce complexity and remain strong performance. While effective, the crucial parts of how dense a graph needs to be to perform well are not fully explored. In this paper, we propose Normalized Information Payload (NIP), a graph scoring function measuring information transfer on graph, which provides an analysis tool for trade-offs between performance and complexity. Guided by this theoretical analysis, we present Hypercube Transformer, a sparse Transformer that models token interactions in a hypercube and shows comparable or even better results with vanilla Transformer while yielding $O(N\log N)$ complexity with sequence length $N$. Experiments on tasks requiring various sequence lengths lay validation for our graph function well.

**Abstract:** The performance of an algorithm often critically depends on its parameter configuration. While a variety of automated algorithm configuration methods have been proposed to relieve users from the tedious and error-prone task of manually tuning parameters, there is still a lot of untapped potential as the learned configuration is static, i.e., parameter settings remain fixed throughout the run. However, it has been shown that some algorithm parameters are best adjusted dynamically during execution, e.g., to adapt to the current part of the optimization landscape. Thus far, this is most commonly achieved through hand-crafted heuristics. A promising recent alternative is to automatically learn such dynamic parameter adaptation policies from data. In this article, we give the first comprehensive account of this new field of automated dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC), present a series of recent advances, and provide a solid foundation for future research in this field. Specifically, we (i) situate DAC in the broader historical context of AI research; (ii) formalize DAC as a computational problem; (iii) identify the methods used in prior-art to tackle this problem; (iv) conduct empirical case studies for using DAC in evolutionary optimization, AI planning, and machine learning.

**Abstract:** Deep learning approach has been demonstrated to automatically segment the bilateral mandibular canals from CBCT scans, yet systematic studies of its clinical and technical validation are scarce. To validate the mandibular canal localization accuracy of a deep learning system (DLS) we trained it with 982 CBCT scans and evaluated using 150 scans of five scanners from clinical workflow patients of European and Southeast Asian Institutes, annotated by four radiologists. The interobserver variability was compared to the variability between the DLS and the radiologists. In addition, the generalization of DLS to CBCT scans from scanners not used in the training data was examined to evaluate the out-of-distribution generalization capability. The DLS had lower variability to the radiologists than the interobserver variability between them and it was able to generalize to three new devices. For the radiologists' consensus segmentation, used as gold standard, the DLS had a symmetric mean curve distance of 0.39 mm compared to those of the individual radiologists with 0.62 mm, 0.55 mm, 0.47 mm, and 0.42 mm. The DLS showed comparable or slightly better performance in the segmentation of the mandibular canal with the radiologists and generalization capability to new scanners.

**Abstract:** Bayesian optimization (BO) has well-documented merits for optimizing black-box functions with an expensive evaluation cost. Such functions emerge in applications as diverse as hyperparameter tuning, drug discovery, and robotics. BO hinges on a Bayesian surrogate model to sequentially select query points so as to balance exploration with exploitation of the search space. Most existing works rely on a single Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate model, where the kernel function form is typically preselected using domain knowledge. To bypass such a design process, this paper leverages an ensemble (E) of GPs to adaptively select the surrogate model fit on-the-fly, yielding a GP mixture posterior with enhanced expressiveness for the sought function. Acquisition of the next evaluation input using this EGP-based function posterior is then enabled by Thompson sampling (TS) that requires no additional design parameters. To endow function sampling with scalability, random feature-based kernel approximation is leveraged per GP model. The novel EGP-TS readily accommodates parallel operation. To further establish convergence of the proposed EGP-TS to the global optimum, analysis is conducted based on the notion of Bayesian regret for both sequential and parallel settings. Tests on synthetic functions and real-world applications showcase the merits of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** When faced with data-starved or highly complex end-tasks, it is commonplace for machine learning practitioners to introduce auxiliary objectives as supplementary learning signals. Whilst much work has been done to formulate useful auxiliary objectives, their construction is still an art which proceeds by slow and tedious hand-design. Intuitions about how and when these objectives improve end-task performance have also had limited theoretical backing. In this work, we present an approach for automatically generating a suite of auxiliary objectives. We achieve this by deconstructing existing objectives within a novel unified taxonomy, identifying connections between them, and generating new ones based on the uncovered structure. Next, we theoretically formalize widely-held intuitions about how auxiliary learning improves generalization of the end-task. This leads us to a principled and efficient algorithm for searching the space of generated objectives to find those most useful to a specified end-task. With natural language processing (NLP) as our domain of study, we empirically verify that our automated auxiliary learning pipeline leads to strong improvements over competitive baselines across continued training experiments on a pre-trained model on 5 NLP end-tasks.

**Abstract:** We propose the finite mixture of skewed sub-Gaussian stable distributions. The maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters of proposed finite mixture model is computed through the expectation-maximization algorithm. The proposed model contains the finite mixture of normal and skewed normal distributions. Since the tails of proposed model is heavier than even the Student's t distribution, it can be used as a powerful model for robust model-based clustering. Performance of the proposed model is demonstrated by clustering simulation data and two sets of real data.

**Abstract:** We propose the framework of dual convexified convolutional neural networks (DCCNNs). In this framework, we first introduce a primal learning problem motivated from convexified convolutional neural networks (CCNNs), and then construct the dual convex training program through careful analysis of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and Fenchel conjugates. Our approach reduces the memory overhead of constructing a large kernel matrix and eliminates the ambiguity of factorizing the matrix. Due to the low-rank structure in CCNNs and the related subdifferential of nuclear norms, there is no closed-form expression to recover the primal solution from the dual solution. To overcome this, we propose a highly novel weight recovery algorithm, which takes the dual solution and the kernel information as the input, and recovers the linear and convolutional weights of a CCNN. Furthermore, our recovery algorithm exploits the low-rank structure and imposes a small number of filters indirectly, which reduces the parameter size. As a result, DCCNNs inherit all the statistical benefits of CCNNs, while enjoying a more formal and efficient workflow.

**Abstract:** Does a neural network's privacy have to be at odds with its accuracy? In this work, we study the effects the number of training epochs and parameters have on a neural network's vulnerability to membership inference (MI) attacks, which aim to extract potentially private information about the training data. We first demonstrate how the number of training epochs and parameters individually induce a privacy-utility trade-off: more of either improves generalization performance at the expense of lower privacy. However, remarkably, we also show that jointly tuning both can eliminate this privacy-utility trade-off. Specifically, with careful tuning of the number of training epochs, more overparameterization can increase model privacy for fixed generalization error. To better understand these phenomena theoretically, we develop a powerful new leave-one-out analysis tool to study the asymptotic behavior of linear classifiers and apply it to characterize the sample-specific loss threshold MI attack in high-dimensional logistic regression. For practitioners, we introduce a low-overhead procedure to estimate MI risk and tune the number of training epochs to guard against MI attacks.

**Abstract:** The log odds ratio is a common parameter to measure association between (binary) outcome and exposure variables. Much attention has been paid to its parametric but robust estimation, or its nonparametric estimation as a function of confounders. However, discussion on how to use a summary statistic by averaging the log odds ratio function is surprisingly difficult to find despite the popularity and importance of averaging in other contexts such as estimating the average treatment effect. We propose a couple of efficient double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimators of the average log odds ratio, where the odds ratios are adjusted for observed (potentially high dimensional) confounders and are averaged over them. The estimators are built from two equivalent forms of the efficient influence function. The first estimator uses a prospective probability of the outcome conditional on the exposure and confounders; the second one employs a retrospective probability of the exposure conditional on the outcome and confounders. Our framework encompasses random sampling as well as outcome-based or exposure-based sampling. Finally, we illustrate how to apply the proposed estimators using real data.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the statistical difficulty of learning to control linear systems. We focus on two standard benchmarks, the sample complexity of stabilization, and the regret of the online learning of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Prior results state that the statistical difficulty for both benchmarks scales polynomially with the system state dimension up to system-theoretic quantities. However, this does not reveal the whole picture. By utilizing minimax lower bounds for both benchmarks, we prove that there exist non-trivial classes of systems for which learning complexity scales dramatically, i.e. exponentially, with the system dimension. This situation arises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs than states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their system theoretic quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension dominating learning complexity. Under some additional structural assumptions (bounding systems away from uncontrollability), we provide qualitatively matching upper bounds. We prove that learning complexity can be at most exponential with the controllability index of the system, that is the degree of underactuation.

**Abstract:** Understanding multivariate dependencies in both the bulk and the tails of a distribution is an important problem for many applications, such as ensuring algorithms are robust to observations that are infrequent but have devastating effects. Archimax copulas are a family of distributions endowed with a precise representation that allows simultaneous modeling of the bulk and the tails of a distribution. Rather than separating the two as is typically done in practice, incorporating additional information from the bulk may improve inference of the tails, where observations are limited. Building on the stochastic representation of Archimax copulas, we develop a non-parametric inference method and sampling algorithm. Our proposed methods, to the best of our knowledge, are the first that allow for highly flexible and scalable inference and sampling algorithms, enabling the increased use of Archimax copulas in practical settings. We experimentally compare to state-of-the-art density modeling techniques, and the results suggest that the proposed method effectively extrapolates to the tails while scaling to higher dimensional data. Our findings suggest that the proposed algorithms can be used in a variety of applications where understanding the interplay between the bulk and the tails of a distribution is necessary, such as healthcare and safety.

**Abstract:** Artificial neural nets can represent and classify many types of data but are often tailored to particular applications -- e.g., for "fair" or "hierarchical" classification. Once an architecture has been selected, it is often difficult for humans to adjust models for a new task; for example, a hierarchical classifier cannot be easily transformed into a fair classifier that shields a protected field. Our contribution in this work is a new neural network architecture, the concept subspace network (CSN), which generalizes existing specialized classifiers to produce a unified model capable of learning a spectrum of multi-concept relationships. We demonstrate that CSNs reproduce state-of-the-art results in fair classification when enforcing concept independence, may be transformed into hierarchical classifiers, or even reconcile fairness and hierarchy within a single classifier. The CSN is inspired by existing prototype-based classifiers that promote interpretability.

**Abstract:** Spatio-temporal graph learning is a key method for urban computing tasks, such as traffic flow, taxi demand and air quality forecasting. Due to the high cost of data collection, some developing cities have few available data, which makes it infeasible to train a well-performed model. To address this challenge, cross-city knowledge transfer has shown its promise, where the model learned from data-sufficient cities is leveraged to benefit the learning process of data-scarce cities. However, the spatio-temporal graphs among different cities show irregular structures and varied features, which limits the feasibility of existing Few-Shot Learning (\emph{FSL}) methods. Therefore, we propose a model-agnostic few-shot learning framework for spatio-temporal graph called ST-GFSL. Specifically, to enhance feature extraction by transfering cross-city knowledge, ST-GFSL proposes to generate non-shared parameters based on node-level meta knowledge. The nodes in target city transfer the knowledge via parameter matching, retrieving from similar spatio-temporal characteristics. Furthermore, we propose to reconstruct the graph structure during meta-learning. The graph reconstruction loss is defined to guide structure-aware learning, avoiding structure deviation among different datasets. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four traffic speed prediction benchmarks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of ST-GFSL compared with state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto standard for private data release and private machine learning. Auditing black-box DP algorithms and mechanisms to certify whether they satisfy a certain DP guarantee is challenging, especially in high dimension. We propose relaxations of differential privacy based on new divergences on probability distributions: the kernel Rényi divergence and its regularized version. We show that the regularized kernel Rényi divergence can be estimated from samples even in high dimensions, giving rise to auditing procedures for $\varepsilon$-DP, $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP and $(α,\varepsilon)$-Rényi DP.

**Abstract:** Grounding dialogue on external knowledge and interpreting linguistic patterns in dialogue history context, such as ellipsis, anaphora, and co-references is critical for dialogue comprehension and generation. In this paper, we present a novel open-domain dialogue generation model which effectively utilizes the large-scale commonsense and named entity based knowledge in addition to the unstructured topic-specific knowledge associated with each utterance. We enhance the commonsense knowledge with named entity-aware structures using co-references. Our proposed model utilizes a multi-hop attention layer to preserve the most accurate and critical parts of the dialogue history and the associated knowledge. In addition, we employ a Commonsense and Named Entity Enhanced Attention Module, which starts with the extracted triples from various sources and gradually finds the relevant supporting set of triples using multi-hop attention with the query vector obtained from the interactive dialogue-knowledge module. Empirical results on two benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic evaluation metrics and human judgment.

**Abstract:** Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects with image-level supervision. Existing works mainly rely on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) derived from a classification model. However, CAM-based methods usually focus on the most discriminative parts of an object (i.e., incomplete localization problem). In this paper, we empirically prove that this problem is associated with the mixup of the activation values between less discriminative foreground regions and the background. To address it, we propose Class RE-Activation Mapping (CREAM), a novel clustering-based approach to boost the activation values of the integral object regions. To this end, we introduce class-specific foreground and background context embeddings as cluster centroids. A CAM-guided momentum preservation strategy is developed to learn the context embeddings during training. At the inference stage, the re-activation mapping is formulated as a parameter estimation problem under Gaussian Mixture Model, which can be solved by deriving an unsupervised Expectation-Maximization based soft-clustering algorithm. By simply integrating CREAM into various WSOL approaches, our method significantly improves their performance. CREAM achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUB, ILSVRC and OpenImages benchmark datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/Jazzcharles/CREAM.

**Abstract:** Domain generalization (DG) is a fundamental yet very challenging research topic in machine learning. The existing arts mainly focus on learning domain-invariant features with limited source domains in a static model. Unfortunately, there is a lack of training-free mechanism to adjust the model when generalized to the agnostic target domains. To tackle this problem, we develop a brand-new DG variant, namely Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), in which the model learns to twist the network parameters to adapt the data from different domains. Specifically, we leverage a meta-adjuster to twist the network parameters based on the static model with respect to different data from different domains. In this way, the static model is optimized to learn domain-shared features, while the meta-adjuster is designed to learn domain-specific features. To enable this process, DomainMix is exploited to simulate data from diverse domains during teaching the meta-adjuster to adapt to the upcoming agnostic target domains. This learning mechanism urges the model to generalize to different agnostic target domains via adjusting the model without training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Code is available at: https://github.com/MetaVisionLab/DDG

**Abstract:** Due to the advent of new mobile devices and tracking sensors in recent years, huge amounts of data are being produced every day. Therefore, novel methodologies need to emerge that dive through this vast sea of information and generate insights and meaningful information. To this end, researchers have developed several trajectory classification algorithms over the years that are able to annotate tracking data. Similarly, in this research, a novel methodology is presented that exploits image representations of trajectories, called TraClets, in order to classify trajectories in an intuitive humans way, through computer vision techniques. Several real-world datasets are used to evaluate the proposed approach and compare its classification performance to other state-of-the-art trajectory classification algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that TraClets achieves a classification performance that is comparable to, or in most cases, better than the state-of-the-art, acting as a universal, high-accuracy approach for trajectory classification.

**Abstract:** We present "PATRED", a technique that uses the addition of redundant information to facilitate the detection of specific, generally described patterns in line-charts during the visual exploration of the charts. We compared different versions of this technique, that differed in the way redundancy was added, using nine distance metrics (such as Euclidean, Pearson, Mutual Information and Jaccard) with judgments from data scientists which served as the "ground truth". Results were analyzed with correlations (R2), F1 scores and Mutual Information with the average ranking by the data scientists. Some distance metrics consistently benefit from the addition of redundant information, while others are only enhanced for specific types of data perturbations. The results demonstrate the value of adding redundancy to improve the identification of patterns in time-series data during visual exploration.

**Abstract:** Graph-level anomaly detection has become a critical topic in diverse areas, such as financial fraud detection and detecting anomalous activities in social networks. While most research has focused on anomaly detection for visual data such as images, where high detection accuracies have been obtained, existing deep learning approaches for graphs currently show considerably worse performance. This paper raises the bar on graph-level anomaly detection, i.e., the task of detecting abnormal graphs in a set of graphs. By drawing on ideas from self-supervised learning and transformation learning, we present a new deep learning approach that significantly improves existing deep one-class approaches by fixing some of their known problems, including hypersphere collapse and performance flip. Experiments on nine real-world data sets involving nine techniques reveal that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 11.8% AUC compared to the best existing approach.

**Abstract:** World models learn the consequences of actions in vision-based interactive systems. However, in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, there commonly exists noncontrollable dynamics independent of the action signals, making it difficult to learn effective world models. To tackle this problem, we present a novel reinforcement learning approach named Iso-Dream, which improves the Dream-to-Control framework in two aspects. First, by optimizing the inverse dynamics, we encourage the world model to learn controllable and noncontrollable sources of spatiotemporal changes on isolated state transition branches. Second, we optimize the behavior of the agent on the decoupled latent imaginations of the world model. Specifically, to estimate state values, we roll-out the noncontrollable states into the future and associate them with the current controllable state. In this way, the isolation of dynamics sources can greatly benefit long-horizon decision-making of the agent, such as a self-driving car that can avoid potential risks by anticipating the movement of other vehicles. Experiments show that Iso-Dream is effective in decoupling the mixed dynamics and remarkably outperforms existing approaches in a wide range of visual control and prediction domains.

**Abstract:** Anchors [Ribeiro et al. (2018)] is a post-hoc, rule-based interpretability method. For text data, it proposes to explain a decision by highlighting a small set of words (an anchor) such that the model to explain has similar outputs when they are present in a document. In this paper, we present the first theoretical analysis of Anchors, considering that the search for the best anchor is exhaustive. We leverage this analysis to gain insights on the behavior of Anchors on simple models, including elementary if-then rules and linear classifiers.

**Abstract:** Nowadays, a tremendous amount of human communications take place on the Internet-based communication infrastructures, like social networks, email, forums, organizational communication platforms, etc. Indeed, the automatic prediction or assessment of individuals' personalities through their written or exchanged text would be advantageous to ameliorate the relationships among them. To this end, this paper aims to propose KGrAt-Net which is a Knowledge Graph Attention Network text classifier. For the first time, it applies the knowledge graph attention network to perform Automatic Personality Prediction (APP), according to the Big Five personality traits. After performing some preprocessing activities, first, it tries to acquire a knowingful representation of the knowledge behind the concepts in the input text through building its equivalent knowledge graph. A knowledge graph is a graph-based data model that formally represents the semantics of the existing concepts in the input text and models the knowledge behind them. Then, applying the attention mechanism, it efforts to pay attention to the most relevant parts of the graph to predict the personality traits of the input text. The results demonstrated that KGrAt-Net considerably improved the personality prediction accuracies. Furthermore, KGrAt-Net also uses the knowledge graphs' embeddings to enrich the classification, which makes it even more accurate in APP.

**Abstract:** Accurate sensor calibration is a prerequisite for multi-sensor perception and localization systems for autonomous vehicles. The intrinsic parameter calibration of the sensor is to obtain the mapping relationship inside the sensor, and the extrinsic parameter calibration is to transform two or more sensors into a unified spatial coordinate system. Most sensors need to be calibrated after installation to ensure the accuracy of sensor measurements. To this end, we present OpenCalib, a calibration toolbox that contains a rich set of various sensor calibration methods. OpenCalib covers manual calibration tools, automatic calibration tools, factory calibration tools, and online calibration tools for different application scenarios. At the same time, to evaluate the calibration accuracy and subsequently improve the accuracy of the calibration algorithm, we released a corresponding benchmark dataset. This paper introduces various features and calibration methods of this toolbox. To our knowledge, this is the first open-sourced calibration codebase containing the full set of autonomous-driving-related calibration approaches in this area. We wish that the toolbox could be helpful to autonomous driving researchers. We have open-sourced our code on GitHub to benefit the community. Code is available at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/SensorsCalibration.

**Abstract:** Given a real inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of linear isometries, we construct a family of $G$-invariant real-valued functions on $V$ that we call max filters. In the case where $V=\mathbb{R}^d$ and $G$ is finite, a suitable max filter bank separates orbits, and is even bilipschitz in the quotient metric. In the case where $V=L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $G$ is the group of translation operators, a max filter exhibits stability to diffeomorphic distortion like that of the scattering transform introduced by Mallat. We establish that max filters are well suited for various classification tasks, both in theory and in practice.

**Abstract:** The elasticity of soft tissues has been widely considered as a characteristic property to differentiate between healthy and vicious tissues and, therefore, motivated several elasticity imaging modalities, such as Ultrasound Elastography, Magnetic Resonance Elastography, and Optical Coherence Elastography. This paper proposes an alternative approach of modeling the elasticity using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging modality for model-based feature extraction machine learning (ML) differentiation of lesions. The model describes a dynamic non-rigid (or elastic) deformation in differential manifold to mimic the soft tissues elasticity under wave fluctuation in vivo. Based on the model, three local deformation invariants are constructed by two tensors defined by the first and second order derivatives from the CT images and used to generate elastic feature maps after normalization via a novel signal suppression method. The model-based elastic image features are extracted from the feature maps and fed to machine learning to perform lesion classifications. Two pathologically proven image datasets of colon polyps (44 malignant and 43 benign) and lung nodules (46 malignant and 20 benign) were used to evaluate the proposed model-based lesion classification. The outcomes of this modeling approach reached the score of area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics of 94.2 % for the polyps and 87.4 % for the nodules, resulting in an average gain of 5 % to 30 % over ten existing state-of-the-art lesion classification methods. The gains by modeling tissue elasticity for ML differentiation of lesions are striking, indicating the great potential of exploring the modeling strategy to other tissue properties for ML differentiation of lesions.

**Abstract:** This paper studies the utility of using data analytics and machine learning techniques for identifying, classifying, and characterizing the dynamics of large-scale parallel (MPI) programs. To this end, we run microbenchmarks and realistic proxy applications with the regular compute-communicate structure on two different supercomputing platforms and choose the per-process performance and MPI time per time step as relevant observables. Using principal component analysis, clustering techniques, correlation functions, and a new "phase space plot," we show how desynchronization patterns (or lack thereof) can be readily identified from a data set that is much smaller than a full MPI trace. Our methods also lead the way towards a more general classification of parallel program dynamics.

**Abstract:** A common assumption in causal inference from observational data is the assumption of no hidden confounding. Yet it is, in general, impossible to verify the presence of hidden confounding factors from a single dataset. However, under the assumption of independent causal mechanisms underlying the data generative process, we demonstrate a way to detect unobserved confounders when having multiple observational datasets coming from different environments. We present a theory for testable conditional independencies that are only violated during hidden confounding and examine cases where we break its assumptions: degenerate & dependent mechanisms, and faithfulness violations. Additionally, we propose a procedure to test these independencies and study its empirical finite-sample behavior using simulation studies.

**Abstract:** With the increasing computing power of edge devices, Federated Learning (FL) emerges to enable model training without privacy concerns. The majority of existing studies assume the data are fully labeled on the client side. In practice, however, the amount of labeled data is often limited. Recently, federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) is explored as a way to effectively utilize unlabeled data during training. In this work, we propose ProtoFSSL, a novel FSSL approach based on prototypical networks. In ProtoFSSL, clients share knowledge with each other via lightweight prototypes, which prevents the local models from diverging. For computing loss on unlabeled data, each client creates accurate pseudo-labels based on shared prototypes. Jointly with labeled data, the pseudo-labels provide training signals for local prototypes. Compared to a FSSL approach based on weight sharing, the prototype-based inter-client knowledge sharing significantly reduces both communication and computation costs, enabling more frequent knowledge sharing between more clients for better accuracy. In multiple datasets, ProtoFSSL results in higher accuracy compared to the recent FSSL methods with and without knowledge sharing, such as FixMatch, FedRGD, and FedMatch. On SVHN dataset, ProtoFSSL performs comparably to fully supervised FL methods.

**Abstract:** Causal relationships among a set of variables are commonly represented by a directed acyclic graph. The orientations of some edges in the causal DAG can be discovered from observational/interventional data. Further edges can be oriented by iteratively applying so-called Meek rules. Inferring edges' orientations from some previously oriented edges, which we call Causal Orientation Learning (COL), is a common problem in various causal discovery tasks. In these tasks, it is often required to solve multiple COL problems and therefore applying Meek rules could be time-consuming. Motivated by Meek rules, we introduce Meek functions that can be utilized in solving COL problems. In particular, we show that these functions have some desirable properties, enabling us to speed up the process of applying Meek rules. In particular, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) based method to apply Meek functions. Moreover, based on the proposed DP method, we present a lower bound on the number of edges that can be oriented as a result of intervention. We also propose a method to check whether some oriented edges belong to a causal DAG. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can outperform previous work in several causal discovery tasks in terms of running-time.

**Abstract:** While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a sound and principled alternative to standard neural networks, an artificial sharpening of the posterior usually needs to be applied to reach comparable performance. This is in stark contrast to theory, dictating that given an adequate prior and a well-specified model, the untempered Bayesian posterior should achieve optimal performance. Despite the community's extensive efforts, the observed gains in performance still remain disputed with several plausible causes pointing at its origin. While data augmentation has been empirically recognized as one of the main drivers of this effect, a theoretical account of its role, on the other hand, is largely missing. In this work we identify two interlaced factors concurrently influencing the strength of the cold posterior effect, namely the correlated nature of augmentations and the degree of invariance of the employed model to such transformations. By theoretically analyzing simplified settings, we prove that tempering implicitly reduces the misspecification arising from modeling augmentations as i.i.d. data. The temperature mimics the role of the effective sample size, reflecting the gain in information provided by the augmentations. We corroborate our theoretical findings with extensive empirical evaluations, scaling to realistic BNNs. By relying on the framework of group convolutions, we experiment with models of varying inherent degree of invariance, confirming its hypothesized relationship with the optimal temperature.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention for their promising performance in graph machine learning. Despite their extraordinary predictive accuracy, existing approaches, such as GCN and GPRGNN, are not robust in the face of homophily changes on test graphs, rendering these models vulnerable to graph structural attacks and with limited capacity in generalizing to graphs of varied homophily levels. Although many methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of GNN models, most of these techniques are restricted to the spatial domain and employ complicated defense mechanisms, such as learning new graph structures or calculating edge attentions. In this paper, we study the problem of designing simple and robust GNN models in the spectral domain. We propose EvenNet, a spectral GNN corresponding to an even-polynomial graph filter. Based on our theoretical analysis in both spatial and spectral domains, we demonstrate that EvenNet outperforms full-order models in generalizing across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, implying that ignoring odd-hop neighbors improves the robustness of GNNs. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of EvenNet. Notably, EvenNet outperforms existing defense models against structural attacks without introducing additional computational costs and maintains competitiveness in traditional node classification tasks on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

**Abstract:** We present a machine sound dataset to benchmark domain generalization techniques for anomalous sound detection (ASD). To handle performance degradation caused by domain shifts that are difficult to detect or too frequent to adapt, domain generalization techniques are preferred. However, currently available datasets have difficulties in evaluating these techniques, such as limited number of values for parameters that cause domain shifts (domain shift parameters). In this paper, we present the first ASD dataset for the domain generalization techniques, called MIMII DG. The dataset consists of five machine types and three domain shift scenarios for each machine type. We prepared at least two values for the domain shift parameters in the source domain. Also, we introduced domain shifts that can be difficult to notice. Experimental results using two baseline systems indicate that the dataset reproduces the domain shift scenarios and is useful for benchmarking domain generalization techniques.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art causal discovery methods usually assume that the observational data is complete. However, the missing data problem is pervasive in many practical scenarios such as clinical trials, economics, and biology. One straightforward way to address the missing data problem is first to impute the data using off-the-shelf imputation methods and then apply existing causal discovery methods. However, such a two-step method may suffer from suboptimality, as the imputation algorithm is unaware of the causal discovery step. In this paper, we develop a general method, which we call MissDAG, to perform causal discovery from data with incomplete observations. Focusing mainly on the assumptions of ignorable missingness and the identifiable additive noise models (ANMs), MissDAG maximizes the expected likelihood of the visible part of observations under the expectation-maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, in cases where computing the posterior distributions of parameters in closed-form is not feasible, Monte Carlo EM is leveraged to approximate the likelihood. In the M-step, MissDAG leverages the density transformation to model the noise distributions with simpler and specific formulations by virtue of the ANMs and uses a likelihood-based causal discovery algorithm with directed acyclic graph prior as an inductive bias. We demonstrate the flexibility of MissDAG for incorporating various causal discovery algorithms and its efficacy through extensive simulations and real data experiments.

**Abstract:** Image super-resolution (SR) has been widely investigated in recent years. However, it is challenging to fairly estimate the performances of various SR methods, as the lack of reliable and accurate criteria for perceptual quality. Existing SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics usually concentrate on the specific kind of degradation without distinguishing the visual sensitive areas, which have no adaptive ability to describe the diverse SR degeneration situations. In this paper, we focus on the textural and structural degradation of image SR which acts as a critical role for visual perception, and design a dual stream network to jointly explore the textural and structural information for quality prediction, dubbed TSNet. By mimicking the human vision system (HVS) that pays more attention to the significant areas of the image, we develop the spatial attention mechanism to make the visual-sensitive areas more distinguishable, which improves the prediction accuracy. Feature normalization (F-Norm) is also developed to investigate the inherent spatial correlation of SR features and boost the network representation capacity. Experimental results show the proposed TSNet predicts the visual quality more accurate than the state-of-the-art IQA methods, and demonstrates better consistency with the human's perspective.

**Abstract:** This paper presents consideration of the Semi-Relaxed Sinkhorn (SR-Sinkhorn) algorithm for the semi-relaxed optimal transport (SROT) problem, which relaxes one marginal constraint of the standard OT problem. For evaluation of how the constraint relaxation affects the algorithm behavior and solution, it is vitally necessary to present the theoretical convergence analysis in terms not only of the functional value gap, but also of the marginal constraint gap as well as the OT distance gap. However, no existing work has addressed all analyses simultaneously. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive convergence analysis for SR-Sinkhorn. After presenting the $ε$-approximation of the functional value gap based on a new proof strategy and exploiting this proof strategy, we give the upper bound of the marginal constraint gap. We also provide its convergence to the $ε$-approximation when two distributions are in the probability simplex. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of the OT distance gap to the $ε$-approximation is given as assisted by the obtained marginal constraint gap. The latter two theoretical results are the first results presented in the literature related to the SROT problem.

**Abstract:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been applied and shown great potential in multi-intersections traffic signal control, where multiple agents, one for each intersection, must cooperate together to optimize traffic flow. To encourage global cooperation, previous work partitions the traffic network into several regions and learns policies for agents in a feudal structure. However, static network partition fails to adapt to dynamic traffic flow, which will changes frequently over time. To address this, we propose a novel feudal MARL approach with adaptive network partition. Specifically, we first partition the network into several regions according to the traffic flow. To do this, we propose two approaches: one is directly to use graph neural network (GNN) to generate the network partition, and the other is to use Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to find the best partition with criteria computed by GNN. Then, we design a variant of Qmix using GNN to handle various dimensions of input, given by the dynamic network partition. Finally, we use a feudal hierarchy to manage agents in each partition and promote global cooperation. By doing so, agents are able to adapt to the traffic flow as required in practice. We empirically evaluate our method both in a synthetic traffic grid and real-world traffic networks of three cities, widely used in the literature. Our experimental results confirm that our method can achieve better performance, in terms of average travel time and queue length, than several leading methods for traffic signal control.

**Abstract:** The fusion of camera sensor and inertial data is a leading method for ego-motion tracking in autonomous and smart devices. State estimation techniques that rely on non-linear filtering are a strong paradigm for solving the associated information fusion task. The de facto inference method in this space is the celebrated extended Kalman filter (EKF), which relies on first-order linearizations of both the dynamical and measurement model. This paper takes a critical look at the practical implications and limitations posed by the EKF, especially under faulty visual feature associations and the presence of strong confounding noise. As an alternative, we revisit the assumed density formulation of Bayesian filtering and employ a moment matching (unscented Kalman filtering) approach to both visual-inertial odometry and visual SLAM. Our results highlight important aspects in robustness both in dynamics propagation and visual measurement updates, and we show state-of-the-art results on EuRoC MAV drone data benchmark.

**Abstract:** Visual object recognition has been extensively studied in both neuroscience and computer vision. Recently, the most popular class of artificial systems for this task, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has been shown to provide excellent models for its functional analogue in the brain, the ventral stream in visual cortex. This has prompted questions on what, if any, are the common principles underlying the reformatting of visual information as it flows through a CNN or the ventral stream. Here we consider some prominent statistical patterns that are known to exist in the internal representations of either CNNs or the visual cortex and look for them in the other system. We show that intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of object representations along the rat homologue of the ventral stream presents two distinct expansion-contraction phases, as previously shown for CNNs. Conversely, in CNNs, we show that training results in both distillation and active pruning (mirroring the increase in ID) of low- to middle-level image information in single units, as representations gain the ability to support invariant discrimination, in agreement with previous observations in rat visual cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest that CNNs and visual cortex share a similarly tight relationship between dimensionality expansion/reduction of object representations and reformatting of image information.

**Abstract:** A deep equilibrium model (DEQ) is implicitly defined through an equilibrium point of an infinite-depth weight-tied model with an input-injection. Instead of infinite computations, it solves an equilibrium point directly with root-finding and computes gradients with implicit differentiation. The training dynamics of over-parameterized DEQs are investigated in this study. By supposing a condition on the initial equilibrium point, we show that the unique equilibrium point always exists during the training process, and the gradient descent is proved to converge to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. In order to show that the required initial condition is satisfied via mild over-parameterization, we perform a fine-grained analysis on random DEQs. We propose a novel probabilistic framework to overcome the technical difficulty in the non-asymptotic analysis of infinite-depth weight-tied models.

**Abstract:** Background and Objective: During pandemics, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches combined with biomedical science play a significant role in reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and physicians. The rapid increment in cases of COVID-19 has led to an increase in demand for hospital beds and other medical equipment. However, since medical facilities are limited, it is recommended to diagnose patients as per the severity of the infection. Keeping this in mind, we share our research in detecting COVID-19 as well as assessing its severity using chest-CT scans and Deep Learning pre-trained models. Dataset: We have collected a total of 1966 CT Scan images for three different class labels, namely, Non-COVID, Severe COVID, and Non-Severe COVID, out of which 714 CT images belong to the Non-COVID category, 713 CT images are for Non-Severe COVID category and 539 CT images are of Severe COVID category. Methods: All of the images are initially pre-processed using the Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) approach. The pre-processed images are then fed into the VGG-16 network for extracting features. Finally, the retrieved characteristics are categorized and the accuracy is evaluated using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross-validation (CV). Result and Conclusion: In our study, we have combined well-known strategies for pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification which brings us to a remarkable success rate of disease and its severity recognition with an accuracy of 96.05% (97.7% for Non-Severe COVID-19 images and 93% for Severe COVID-19 images). Our model can therefore help radiologists detect COVID-19 and the extent of its severity.

**Abstract:** The optimal transport (OT) problem has been used widely for machine learning. It is necessary for computation of an OT problem to solve linear programming with tight mass-conservation constraints. These constraints prevent its application to large-scale problems. To address this issue, loosening such constraints enables us to propose the relaxed-OT method using a faster algorithm. This approach has demonstrated its effectiveness for applications. However, it remains slow. As a superior alternative, we propose a fast block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm for a convex semi-relaxed OT. Specifically, we prove their upper bounds of the worst convergence iterations, and equivalence between the linearization duality gap and the Lagrangian duality gap. Additionally, we develop two fast variants of the proposed BCFW. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that our proposed algorithms are effective for color transfer and surpass state-of-the-art algorithms. This report presents a short version of arXiv:2103.05857.

**Abstract:** Evolutionary algorithms solve problems by simulating the evolution of a population of candidate solutions. We focus on evolving permutations for ordering problems like the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), as well as assignment problems like the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) and largest common subgraph (LCS). We propose cycle mutation, a new mutation operator whose inspiration is the well known cycle crossover operator, and the concept of a permutation cycle. We use fitness landscape analysis to explore the problem characteristics for which cycle mutation works best. As a prerequisite, we develop new permutation distance measures: cycle distance, $k$-cycle distance, and cycle edit distance. The fitness landscape analysis predicts that cycle mutation is better suited for assignment and mapping problems than it is for ordering problems. We experimentally validate these findings showing cycle mutation's strengths on problems like QAP and LCS, and its limitations on problems like the TSP, while also showing that it is less prone to local optima than commonly used alternatives. We integrate cycle mutation into the open-source Chips-n-Salsa library, and the new distance metrics into the open-source JavaPermutationTools library.

**Abstract:** With the development of vehicular technologies on automation, electrification, and digitalization, vehicles are becoming more intelligent while being exposed to more complex, uncertain, and frequently occurring faults. In this paper, we look into the maintenance planning of an operating vehicle under fault condition and formulate it as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The maintenance decisions are generated by route searching in road networks and evaluated based on risk assessment considering the uncertainty of vehicle breakdowns. Particularly, we consider two criteria, namely the risk of public time loss and the risk of mission delay, representing the concerns of the public sector and the private sector, respectively. A public time loss model is developed to evaluate the traffic congestion caused by a vehicle breakdown and the corresponding towing process. The Pareto optimal set of non-dominated decisions is derived by evaluating the risk of the decisions. We demonstrate the relevance of the problem and the effectiveness of the proposed method by numerical experiments derived from real-world scenarios. The experiments show that neglecting the risk of vehicle breakdown on public roads can cause a high risk of public time loss in dense traffic flow. With the proposed method, alternate decisions can be derived to reduce the risks of public time loss significantly with a low increase in the risk of mission delay. This study aims at catalyzing public-private partnership through collaborative decision-making between the private sector and the public sector, thus archiving a more sustainable transportation system in the future.

**Abstract:** Masked image modeling (MIM), an emerging self-supervised pre-training method, has shown impressive success across numerous downstream vision tasks with Vision transformers (ViT). Its underlying idea is simple: a portion of the input image is randomly masked out and then reconstructed via the pre-text task. However, why MIM works well is not well explained, and previous studies insist that MIM primarily works for the Transformer family but is incompatible with CNNs. In this paper, we first study interactions among patches to understand what knowledge is learned and how it is acquired via the MIM task. We observe that MIM essentially teaches the model to learn better middle-level interactions among patches and extract more generalized features. Based on this fact, we propose an Architecture-Agnostic Masked Image Modeling framework (A$^2$MIM), which is compatible with not only Transformers but also CNNs in a unified way. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our A$^2$MIM learns better representations and endows the backbone model with the stronger capability to transfer to various downstream tasks for both Transformers and CNNs.

**Abstract:** It is well-known that inverse dynamics models can improve tracking performance in robot control. These models need to precisely capture the robot dynamics, which consist of well-understood components, e.g., rigid body dynamics, and effects that remain challenging to capture, e.g., stick-slip friction and mechanical flexibilities. Such effects exhibit hysteresis and partial observability, rendering them, particularly challenging to model. Hence, hybrid models, which combine a physical prior with data-driven approaches are especially well-suited in this setting. We present a novel hybrid model formulation that enables us to identify fully physically consistent inertial parameters of a rigid body dynamics model which is paired with a recurrent neural network architecture, allowing us to capture unmodeled partially observable effects using the network memory. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art inverse dynamics models on a 7 degree of freedom manipulator. Using data sets obtained through an optimal experiment design approach, we study the accuracy of offline torque prediction and generalization capabilities of joint learning methods. In control experiments on the real system, we evaluate the model as a feed-forward term for impedance control and show the feedback gains can be drastically reduced to achieve a given tracking accuracy.

**Abstract:** Tree-based models are used in many high-stakes application domains such as finance and medicine, where robustness and interpretability are of utmost importance. Yet, methods for improving and certifying their robustness are severely under-explored, in contrast to those focusing on neural networks. Targeting this important challenge, we propose deterministic smoothing for decision stump ensembles. Whereas most prior work on randomized smoothing focuses on evaluating arbitrary base models approximately under input randomization, the key insight of our work is that decision stump ensembles enable exact yet efficient evaluation via dynamic programming. Importantly, we obtain deterministic robustness certificates, even jointly over numerical and categorical features, a setting ubiquitous in the real world. Further, we derive an MLE-optimal training method for smoothed decision stumps under randomization and propose two boosting approaches to improve their provable robustness. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that our approach yields significantly higher certified accuracies than the state-of-the-art for tree-based models. We release all code and trained models at ANONYMIZED.

**Abstract:** A noisy generalized phase retrieval (NGPR) problem refers to a problem of estimating $x_0 \in \mathbb{C}^d$ by noisy quadratic samples $\big\{x_0^*A_kx_0+η_k\big\}_{k=1}^n$ where $A_k$ is a Hermitian matrix and $η_k$ is a noise scalar. When $A_k=α_kα_k^*$ for some $α_k\in\mathbb{C}^d$, it reduces to a standard noisy phase retrieval (NPR) problem. The main aim of this paper is to study the estimation performance of empirical $\ell_2$ risk minimization in both problems when $A_k$ in NGPR, or $α_k$ in NPR, is drawn from sub-Gaussian distribution. Under different kinds of noise patterns, we establish error bounds that can imply approximate reconstruction and these results are new in the literature. In NGPR, we show the bounds are of $O\big(\frac{||η||}{\sqrt{n}}\big)$ and $O\big(||η||_\infty \sqrt{\frac{d}{n}}\big)$ for general noise, and of $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{d\log n}{n}}\big)$ and $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{d(\log n)^2}{n}}\big)$ for random noise with sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential tail respectively, where $\| η\|$ and $\| η\|_{\infty}$ are the 2-norm and sup-norm of the noise vector of $η_k$. Under heavy-tailed noise, by truncating response outliers we propose a robust estimator that possesses an error bound with slower convergence rate. On the other hand, we obtain in NPR the bound is of $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{d\log n}{n}}\big)$ and $O\big(\sqrt{\frac{d(\log n)^2}{n}}\big)$) for sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential noise respectively, which is essentially tighter than the existing bound $O\big(\frac{||η||_2}{\sqrt{n}}\big)$. Although NGPR involving measurement matrix $A_k$ is more computationally demanding than NPR involving measurement vector $α_k$, our results reveal that NGPR exhibits stronger robustness than NPR under biased and deterministic noise. Experimental results are presented to confirm and demonstrate our theoretical findings.
