**Abstract:** The mushroom body of the fruit fly brain is one of the best studied systems in neuroscience. At its core it consists of a population of Kenyon cells, which receive inputs from multiple sensory modalities. These cells are inhibited by the anterior paired lateral neuron, thus creating a sparse high dimensional representation of the inputs. In this work we study a mathematical formalization of this network motif and apply it to learning the correlational structure between words and their context in a corpus of unstructured text, a common natural language processing (NLP) task. We show that this network can learn semantic representations of words and can generate both static and context-dependent word embeddings. Unlike conventional methods (e.g., BERT, GloVe) that use dense representations for word embedding, our algorithm encodes semantic meaning of words and their context in the form of sparse binary hash codes. The quality of the learned representations is evaluated on word similarity analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and document classification. It is shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance comparable to existing methods in NLP, but, additionally, it uses only a fraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller memory footprint).

**Abstract:** We introduce the first end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based framework for active high frequency trading. We train DRL agents to trade one unit of Intel Corporation stock by employing the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. The training is performed on three contiguous months of high frequency Limit Order Book data, of which the last month constitutes the validation data. In order to maximise the signal to noise ratio in the training data, we compose the latter by only selecting training samples with largest price changes. The test is then carried out on the following month of data. Hyperparameters are tuned using the Sequential Model Based Optimization technique. We consider three different state characterizations, which differ in their LOB-based meta-features. Analysing the agents' performances on test data, we argue that the agents are able to create a dynamic representation of the underlying environment. They identify occasional regularities present in the data and exploit them to create long-term profitable trading strategies. Indeed, agents learn trading strategies able to produce stable positive returns in spite of the highly stochastic and non-stationary environment.

**Abstract:** Dirbusting is a technique used to brute force directories and file names on web servers while monitoring HTTP responses, in order to enumerate server contents. Such a technique uses lists of common words to discover the hidden structure of the target website. Dirbusting typically relies on response codes as discovery conditions to find new pages. It is widely used in web application penetration testing, an activity that allows companies to detect websites vulnerabilities. Dirbusting techniques are both time and resource consuming and innovative approaches have never been explored in this field. We hence propose an advanced technique to optimize the dirbusting process by leveraging Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, we use semantic clustering techniques in order to organize wordlist items in different groups according to their semantic meaning. The created clusters are used in an ad-hoc implemented next-word intelligent strategy. This paper demonstrates that the usage of clustering techniques outperforms the commonly used brute force methods. Performance is evaluated by testing eight different web applications. Results show a performance increase that is up to 50% for each of the conducted experiments.

**Abstract:** The advent of the Internet and a large number of digital technologies has brought with it many different challenges. A large amount of data is found on the web, which in most cases is unstructured and unorganized, and this contributes to the fact that the use and manipulation of this data is quite a difficult process. Due to this fact, the usage of different machine and deep learning techniques for Text Classification has gained its importance, which improved this discipline and made it more interesting for scientists and researchers for further study. This paper aims to classify the pedagogical content using two different models, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) from the conventional models and the Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network from the deep learning models. The result indicates that the accuracy of classifying the pedagogical content reaches 92.52 % using KNN model and 87.71 % using LSTM model.

**Abstract:** Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the field of image inpainting, which could produce visually plausible results. Meanwhile, the malicious use of advanced image inpainting tools (e.g. removing key objects to report fake news) has led to increasing threats to the reliability of image data. To fight against the inpainting forgeries, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end Generalizable Image Inpainting Detection Network (GIID-Net), to detect the inpainted regions at pixel accuracy. The proposed GIID-Net consists of three sub-blocks: the enhancement block, the extraction block and the decision block. Specifically, the enhancement block aims to enhance the inpainting traces by using hierarchically combined special layers. The extraction block, automatically designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, is targeted to extract features for the actual inpainting detection tasks. In order to further optimize the extracted latent features, we integrate global and local attention modules in the decision block, where the global attention reduces the intra-class differences by measuring the similarity of global features, while the local attention strengthens the consistency of local features. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the generalizability of our GIID-Net, and find that different training data could result in vastly different generalization capability. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed GIID-Net, compared with the state-of-the-art competitors. Our results would suggest that common artifacts are shared across diverse image inpainting methods. Finally, we build a public inpainting dataset of 10K image pairs for the future research in this area.

**Abstract:** Training a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is more challenging than training a single-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, because the result of a multi-agent task strongly depends on the complex interactions among agents and their interactions with a stochastic and dynamic environment. We propose an algorithm that boosts MARL training using the biased action information of other agents based on a friend-or-foe concept. For a cooperative and competitive environment, there are generally two groups of agents: cooperative-agents and competitive-agents. In the proposed algorithm, each agent updates its value function using its own action and the biased action information of other agents in the two groups. The biased joint action of cooperative agents is computed as the sum of their actual joint action and the imaginary cooperative joint action, by assuming all the cooperative agents jointly maximize the target agent's value function. The biased joint action of competitive agents can be computed similarly. Each agent then updates its own value function using the biased action information, resulting in a biased value function and corresponding biased policy. Subsequently, the biased policy of each agent is inevitably subjected to recommend an action to cooperate and compete with other agents, thereby introducing more active interactions among agents and enhancing the MARL policy learning. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in various mixed cooperative-competitive environments. Furthermore, the introduced biases gradually decrease as the training proceeds and the correction based on the imaginary assumption vanishes.

**Abstract:** Learning from visual data opens the potential to accrue a large range of manipulation behaviors by leveraging human demonstrations without specifying each of them mathematically, but rather through natural task specification. In this paper, we present Learning by Watching (LbW), an algorithmic framework for policy learning through imitation from a single video specifying the task. The key insights of our method are two-fold. First, since the human arms may not have the same morphology as robot arms, our framework learns unsupervised human to robot translation to overcome the morphology mismatch issue. Second, to capture the details in salient regions that are crucial for learning state representations, our model performs unsupervised keypoint detection on the translated robot videos. The detected keypoints form a structured representation that contains semantically meaningful information and can be used directly for computing reward and policy learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of our LbW framework on five robot manipulation tasks, including reaching, pushing, sliding, coffee making, and drawer closing. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of control policies and introduce the new multi-task environment Messenger with free-form text manuals describing the environment dynamics. Unlike previous work, Messenger does not assume prior knowledge connecting text and state observations $-$ the control policy must simultaneously ground the game manual to entity symbols and dynamics in the environment. We develop a new model, EMMA (Entity Mapper with Multi-modal Attention) which uses an entity-conditioned attention module that allows for selective focus over relevant descriptions in the manual for each entity in the environment. EMMA is end-to-end differentiable and learns a latent grounding of entities and dynamics from text to observations using only environment rewards. EMMA achieves successful zero-shot generalization to unseen games with new dynamics, obtaining a 40% higher win rate compared to multiple baselines. However, win rate on the hardest stage of Messenger remains low (10%), demonstrating the need for additional work in this direction.

**Abstract:** The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on, with multiple waves causing substantial harm to health and economies around the world. Motivated by the use of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, PPV, specificity, and NPV of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7%/99%/98.8% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment. While not a production-ready solution, we hope the open-source, open-access release of COVID-Net CT-2 and benchmark datasets will continue to enable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to build upon them.

**Abstract:** Several deep neural ranking models have been proposed in the recent IR literature. While their transferability to one target domain held by a dataset has been widely addressed using traditional domain adaptation strategies, the question of their cross-domain transferability is still under-studied. We study here in what extent neural ranking models catastrophically forget old knowledge acquired from previously observed domains after acquiring new knowledge, leading to performance decrease on those domains. Our experiments show that the effectiveness of neuralIR ranking models is achieved at the cost of catastrophic forgetting and that a lifelong learning strategy using a cross-domain regularizer success-fully mitigates the problem. Using an explanatory approach built on a regression model, we also show the effect of domain characteristics on the rise of catastrophic forgetting. We believe that the obtained results can be useful for both theoretical and practical future work in neural IR.

**Abstract:** Continual learning is known for suffering from catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where earlier learned concepts are forgotten at the expense of more recent samples. In this work, we challenge the assumption that continual learning is inevitably associated with catastrophic forgetting by presenting a set of tasks that surprisingly do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learned continually. We provide evidence that these reconstruction-type tasks exhibit positive forward transfer and that single-view 3D shape reconstruction improves the performance on learned and novel categories over time. We provide the novel analysis of knowledge transfer ability by looking at the output distribution shift across sequential learning tasks. Finally, we show that the robustness of these tasks leads to the potential of having a proxy representation learning task for continual classification.

**Abstract:** Humans are able to form a complex mental model of the environment they move in. This mental model captures geometric and semantic aspects of the scene, describes the environment at multiple levels of abstractions (e.g., objects, rooms, buildings), includes static and dynamic entities and their relations (e.g., a person is in a room at a given time). In contrast, current robots' internal representations still provide a partial and fragmented understanding of the environment, either in the form of a sparse or dense set of geometric primitives (e.g., points, lines, planes, voxels) or as a collection of objects. This paper attempts to reduce the gap between robot and human perception by introducing a novel representation, a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph(DSG), that seamlessly captures metric and semantic aspects of a dynamic environment. A DSG is a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at different levels of abstraction, and edges represent spatio-temporal relations among nodes. Our second contribution is Kimera, the first fully automatic method to build a DSG from visual-inertial data. Kimera includes state-of-the-art techniques for visual-inertial SLAM, metric-semantic 3D reconstruction, object localization, human pose and shape estimation, and scene parsing. Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of Kimera in real-life datasets and photo-realistic simulations, including a newly released dataset, uHumans2, which simulates a collection of crowded indoor and outdoor scenes. Our evaluation shows that Kimera achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual-inertial SLAM, estimates an accurate 3D metric-semantic mesh model in real-time, and builds a DSG of a complex indoor environment with tens of objects and humans in minutes. Our final contribution shows how to use a DSG for real-time hierarchical semantic path-planning. The core modules in Kimera are open-source.

**Abstract:** Deep learning models are increasingly used in mobile applications as critical components. Unlike the program bytecode whose vulnerabilities and threats have been widely-discussed, whether and how the deep learning models deployed in the applications can be compromised are not well-understood since neural networks are usually viewed as a black box. In this paper, we introduce a highly practical backdoor attack achieved with a set of reverse-engineering techniques over compiled deep learning models. The core of the attack is a neural conditional branch constructed with a trigger detector and several operators and injected into the victim model as a malicious payload. The attack is effective as the conditional logic can be flexibly customized by the attacker, and scalable as it does not require any prior knowledge from the original model. We evaluated the attack effectiveness using 5 state-of-the-art deep learning models and real-world samples collected from 30 users. The results demonstrated that the injected backdoor can be triggered with a success rate of 93.5%, while only brought less than 2ms latency overhead and no more than 1.4% accuracy decrease. We further conducted an empirical study on real-world mobile deep learning apps collected from Google Play. We found 54 apps that were vulnerable to our attack, including popular and security-critical ones. The results call for the awareness of deep learning application developers and auditors to enhance the protection of deployed models.

**Abstract:** Brain Computer Interface technologies are popular methods of communication between the human brain and external devices. One of the most popular approaches to BCI is Motor Imagery. In BCI applications, the ElectroEncephaloGraphy is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its non-invasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal pre-processing, feature extraction and decision making. In this paper, we define a BCI Framework, named Enhanced Fusion Framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. Firstly, we include aan additional pre-processing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG signal that makes it time-invariant. Secondly, we add an additional frequency band as feature for the system and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing motor imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new system achieved a 88.80% of accuracy. We also propose an optimized version of our system that is able to obtain up to 90,76%. Furthermore, we find that the pair Choquet/Sugeno integrals and overlap functions are the ones providing the best results.

**Abstract:** It is widely accepted that reasoning about object shape is important for object recognition. However, the most powerful object recognition methods today do not explicitly make use of object shape during learning. In this work, motivated by recent developments in low-shot learning, findings in developmental psychology, and the increased use of synthetic data in computer vision research, we investigate how reasoning about 3D shape can be used to improve low-shot learning methods' generalization performance. We propose a new way to improve existing low-shot learning approaches by learning a discriminative embedding space using 3D object shape, and using this embedding by learning how to map images into it. Our new approach improves the performance of image-only low-shot learning approaches on multiple datasets. We also introduce Toys4K, a 3D object dataset with the largest number of object categories currently available, which supports low-shot learning.

**Abstract:** Recent improvements in the predictive quality of natural language processing systems are often dependent on a substantial increase in the number of model parameters. This has led to various attempts of compressing such models, but existing methods have not considered the differences in the predictive power of various model components or in the generalizability of the compressed models. To understand the connection between model compression and out-of-distribution generalization, we define the task of compressing language representation models such that they perform best in a domain adaptation setting. We choose to address this problem from a causal perspective, attempting to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of a model component, such as a single layer, on the model's predictions. Our proposed ATE-guided Model Compression scheme (AMoC), generates many model candidates, differing by the model components that were removed. Then, we select the best candidate through a stepwise regression model that utilizes the ATE to predict the expected performance on the target domain. AMoC outperforms strong baselines on dozens of domain pairs across three text classification and sequence tagging tasks.

**Abstract:** Multimodal generative models should be able to learn a meaningful latent representation that enables a coherent joint generation of all modalities (e.g., images and text). Many applications also require the ability to accurately sample modalities conditioned on observations of a subset of the modalities. Often not all modalities may be observed for all training data points, so semi-supervised learning should be possible. In this study, we propose a novel product-of-experts (PoE) based variational autoencoder that have these desired properties. We benchmark it against a mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach and an approach of combining the modalities with an additional encoder network. An empirical evaluation shows that the PoE based models can outperform the contrasted models. Our experiments support the intuition that PoE models are more suited for a conjunctive combination of modalities.

**Abstract:** We introduce FELICIA (FEderated LearnIng with a CentralIzed Adversary) a generative mechanism enabling collaborative learning. In particular, we show how a data owner with limited and biased data could benefit from other data owners while keeping data from all the sources private. This is a common scenario in medical image analysis where privacy legislation prevents data from being shared outside local premises. FELICIA works for a large family of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures including vanilla and conditional GANs as demonstrated in this work. We show that by using the FELICIA mechanism, a data owner with limited image samples can generate high-quality synthetic images with high utility while neither data owners has to provide access to its data. The sharing happens solely through a central discriminator that has access limited to synthetic data. Here, utility is defined as classification performance on a real test set. We demonstrate these benefits on several realistic healthcare scenarions using benchmark image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) as well as on medical images for the task of skin lesion classification. With multiple experiments, we show that even in the worst cases, combining FELICIA with real data gracefully achieves performance on par with real data while most results significantly improves the utility.

**Abstract:** The identification and counting of small graph patterns, called network motifs, is a fundamental primitive in the analysis of networks, with application in various domains, from social networks to neuroscience. Several techniques have been designed to count the occurrences of motifs in static networks, with recent work focusing on the computational challenges provided by large networks. Modern networked datasets contain rich information, such as the time at which the events modeled by the networks edges happened, which can provide useful insights into the process modeled by the network. The analysis of motifs in temporal networks, called temporal motifs, is becoming an important component in the analysis of modern networked datasets. Several methods have been recently designed to count the number of instances of temporal motifs in temporal networks, which is even more challenging than its counterpart for static networks. Such methods are either exact, and not applicable to large networks, or approximate, but provide only weak guarantees on the estimates they produce and do not scale to very large networks. In this work we present an efficient and scalable algorithm to obtain rigorous approximations of the count of temporal motifs. Our algorithm is based on a simple but effective sampling approach, which renders our algorithm practical for very large datasets. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm provides estimates of temporal motif counts which are more accurate than the state-of-the-art sampling algorithms, with significantly lower running time than exact approaches, enabling the study of temporal motifs, of size larger than the ones considered in previous works, on billion edges networks.

**Abstract:** The digitization of medical records ushered in a new era of big data to clinical science, and with it the possibility that data could be shared, to multiply insights beyond what investigators could abstract from paper records. The need to share individual-level medical data to accelerate innovation in precision medicine continues to grow, and has never been more urgent, as scientists grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enthusiasm for the use of big data has been tempered by a fully appropriate concern for patient autonomy and privacy. That is, the ability to extract private or confidential information about an individual, in practice, renders it difficult to share data, since significant infrastructure and data governance must be established before data can be shared. Although HIPAA provided de-identification as an approved mechanism for data sharing, linkage attacks were identified as a major vulnerability. A variety of mechanisms have been established to avoid leaking private information, such as field suppression or abstraction, strictly limiting the amount of information that can be shared, or employing mathematical techniques such as differential privacy. Another approach, which we focus on here, is creating synthetic data that mimics the underlying data. For synthetic data to be a useful mechanism in support of medical innovation and a proxy for real-world evidence, one must demonstrate two properties of the synthetic dataset: (1) any analysis on the real data must be matched by analysis of the synthetic data (statistical fidelity) and (2) the synthetic data must preserve privacy, with minimal risk of re-identification (privacy guarantee). In this paper we propose a framework for quantifying the statistical fidelity and privacy preservation properties of synthetic datasets and demonstrate these metrics for synthetic data generated by Syntegra technology.

**Abstract:** Benefiting from convenient cycling and flexible parking locations, the Dockless Public Bicycle-sharing (DL-PBS) network becomes increasingly popular in many countries. However, redundant and low-utility stations waste public urban space and maintenance costs of DL-PBS vendors. In this paper, we propose a Bicycle Station Dynamic Planning (BSDP) system to dynamically provide the optimal bicycle station layout for the DL-PBS network. The BSDP system contains four modules: bicycle drop-off location clustering, bicycle-station graph modeling, bicycle-station location prediction, and bicycle-station layout recommendation. In the bicycle drop-off location clustering module, candidate bicycle stations are clustered from each spatio-temporal subset of the large-scale cycling trajectory records. In the bicycle-station graph modeling module, a weighted digraph model is built based on the clustering results and inferior stations with low station revenue and utility are filtered. Then, graph models across time periods are combined to create a graph sequence model. In the bicycle-station location prediction module, the GGNN model is used to train the graph sequence data and dynamically predict bicycle stations in the next period. In the bicycle-station layout recommendation module, the predicted bicycle stations are fine-tuned according to the government urban management plan, which ensures that the recommended station layout is conducive to city management, vendor revenue, and user convenience. Experiments on actual DL-PBS networks verify the effectiveness, accuracy and feasibility of the proposed BSDP system.

**Abstract:** People spend an enormous amount of time and effort looking for lost objects. To help remind people of the location of lost objects, various computational systems that provide information on their locations have been developed. However, prior systems for assisting people in finding objects require users to register the target objects in advance. This requirement imposes a cumbersome burden on the users, and the system cannot help remind them of unexpectedly lost objects. We propose GO-Finder ("Generic Object Finder"), a registration-free wearable camera based system for assisting people in finding an arbitrary number of objects based on two key features: automatic discovery of hand-held objects and image-based candidate selection. Given a video taken from a wearable camera, Go-Finder automatically detects and groups hand-held objects to form a visual timeline of the objects. Users can retrieve the last appearance of the object by browsing the timeline through a smartphone app. We conducted a user study to investigate how users benefit from using GO-Finder and confirmed improved accuracy and reduced mental load regarding the object search task by providing clear visual cues on object locations.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of efficient blackbox optimization over a large hybrid search space, consisting of a mixture of a high dimensional continuous space and a complex combinatorial space. Such examples arise commonly in evolutionary computation, but also more recently, neuroevolution and architecture search for Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies. Unfortunately however, previous mutation-based approaches suffer in high dimensional continuous spaces both theoretically and practically. We thus instead propose ES-ENAS, a simple joint optimization procedure by combining Evolutionary Strategies (ES) and combinatorial optimization techniques in a highly scalable and intuitive way, inspired by the one-shot or supernet paradigm introduced in Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS). Through this relatively simple marriage between two different lines of research, we are able to gain the best of both worlds, and empirically demonstrate our approach by optimizing BBOB functions over hybrid spaces as well as combinatorial neural network architectures via edge pruning and quantization on popular RL benchmarks. Due to the modularity of the algorithm, we also are able incorporate a wide variety of popular techniques ranging from use of different continuous and combinatorial optimizers, as well as constrained optimization.

**Abstract:** Autonomous experimentation enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for accelerating scientific discovery. Non-equilibrium materials synthesis is emblematic of complex, resource-intensive experimentation whose acceleration would be a watershed for materials discovery and development. The mapping of non-equilibrium synthesis phase diagrams has recently been accelerated via high throughput experimentation but still limits materials research because the parameter space is too vast to be exhaustively explored. We demonstrate accelerated synthesis and exploration of metastable materials through hierarchical autonomous experimentation governed by the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent (SARA). SARA integrates robotic materials synthesis and characterization along with a hierarchy of AI methods that efficiently reveal the structure of processing phase diagrams. SARA designs lateral gradient laser spike annealing (lg-LSA) experiments for parallel materials synthesis and employs optical spectroscopy to rapidly identify phase transitions. Efficient exploration of the multi-dimensional parameter space is achieved with nested active learning (AL) cycles built upon advanced machine learning models that incorporate the underlying physics of the experiments as well as end-to-end uncertainty quantification. With this, and the coordination of AL at multiple scales, SARA embodies AI harnessing of complex scientific tasks. We demonstrate its performance by autonomously mapping synthesis phase boundaries for the Bi$_2$O$_3$ system, leading to orders-of-magnitude acceleration in establishment of a synthesis phase diagram that includes conditions for kinetically stabilizing $Œ¥$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ at room temperature, a critical development for electrochemical technologies such as solid oxide fuel cells.

**Abstract:** We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob's model includes all words (n = 5200) and Alice's SMS has at most m = 160 unigrams. In the case with n = 369 and m = 8 (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21ms.

**Abstract:** We consider the point evaluation of the solution to interface problems with geometric uncertainties, where the uncertainty in the obstacle is described by a high-dimensional parameter $\boldsymbol{y}\in[-1,1]^d$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$. We focus in particular on an elliptic interface problem and a Helmholtz transmission problem. Point values of the solution in the physical domain depend in general non-smoothly on the high-dimensional parameter, posing a challenge when one is interested in building surrogates. Indeed, high-order methods show poor convergence rates, while methods which are able to track discontinuities usually suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality. For this reason, in this work we propose to build surrogates for point evaluation using deep neural networks. We provide a theoretical justification for why we expect neural networks to provide good surrogates. Furthermore, we present extensive numerical experiments showing their good performance in practice. We observe in particular that neural networks do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and we study the dependence of the error on the number of point evaluations (that is, the number of discontinuities in the parameter space), as well as on several modeling parameters, such as the contrast between the two materials and, for the Helmholtz transmission problem, the wavenumber.

We use interactive visualization of slices of predictor space to address the interpretability deficit; in effect opening up the black-box of machine learning algorithms, for the purpose of interrogating, explaining, validating and comparing model fits. Slices are specified directly through interaction, or using various touring algorithms designed to visit high-occupancy sections or regions where the model fits have interesting properties.

**Abstract:** Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant results, most notably by leveraging the representation learning abilities of deep neural networks. However, large centralized approaches quickly become infeasible as the number of agents scale, and fully decentralized approaches can miss important opportunities for information sharing and coordination. Furthermore, not all agents are equal - in some cases, individual agents may not even have the ability to send communication to other agents or explicitly model other agents. This paper considers the case where there is a single, powerful, central agent that can observe the entire observation space, and there are multiple, low powered, local agents that can only receive local observations and cannot communicate with each other. The job of the central agent is to learn what message to send to different local agents, based on the global observations, not by centrally solving the entire problem and sending action commands, but by determining what additional information an individual agent should receive so that it can make a better decision. After explaining our MARL algorithm, hammer, and where it would be most applicable, we implement it in the cooperative navigation and multi-agent walker domains. Empirical results show that 1) learned communication does indeed improve system performance, 2) results generalize to multiple numbers of agents, and 3) results generalize to different reward structures.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have received considerable attention in clinical imaging, particularly with respect to the reduction of radiation risk. Lowering the radiation dose by reducing the photon flux inevitably results in the degradation of the scanned image quality. Thus, researchers have sought to exploit deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to map low-quality, low-dose images to higher-dose, higher-quality images thereby minimizing the associated radiation hazard. Conversely, computed tomography (CT) measurements of geomaterials are not limited by the radiation dose. In contrast to the human body, however, geomaterials may be comprised of high-density constituents causing increased attenuation of the X-Rays. Consequently, higher dosage images are required to obtain an acceptable scan quality. The problem of prolonged acquisition times is particularly severe for micro-CT based scanning technologies. Depending on the sample size and exposure time settings, a single scan may require several hours to complete. This is of particular concern if phenomena with an exponential temperature dependency are to be elucidated. A process may happen too fast to be adequately captured by CT scanning. To address the aforementioned issues, we apply DCNNs to improve the quality of rock CT images and reduce exposure times by more than 60\%, simultaneously. We highlight current results based on micro-CT derived datasets and apply transfer learning to improve DCNN results without increasing training time. The approach is applicable to any computed tomography technology. Furthermore, we contrast the performance of the DCNN trained by minimizing different loss functions such as mean squared error and structural similarity index.

**Abstract:** In recent times, object detection and pose estimation have gained significant attention in the context of robotic vision applications. Both the identification of objects of interest as well as the estimation of their pose remain important capabilities in order for robots to provide effective assistance for numerous robotic applications ranging from household tasks to industrial manipulation. This problem is particularly challenging because of the heterogeneity of objects having different and potentially complex shapes, and the difficulties arising due to background clutter and partial occlusions between objects. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a system that performs real-time object detection and pose estimation, for the purpose of dynamic robot grasping. The robot has been pre-trained to perform a small set of canonical grasps from a few fixed poses for each object. When presented with an unknown object in an arbitrary pose, the proposed approach allows the robot to detect the object identity and its actual pose, and then adapt a canonical grasp in order to be used with the new pose. For training, the system defines a canonical grasp by capturing the relative pose of an object with respect to the gripper attached to the robot's wrist. During testing, once a new pose is detected, a canonical grasp for the object is identified and then dynamically adapted by adjusting the robot arm's joint angles, so that the gripper can grasp the object in its new pose. We conducted experiments using a humanoid PR2 robot and showed that the proposed framework can detect well-textured objects, and provide accurate pose estimation in the presence of tolerable amounts of out-of-plane rotation. The performance is also illustrated by the robot successfully grasping objects from a wide range of arbitrary poses.

**Abstract:** Beyond the complexity of CNNs that require training on large annotated datasets, the domain shift between design and operational data has limited the adoption of CNNs in many real-world applications. For instance, in person re-identification, videos are captured over a distributed set of cameras with non-overlapping viewpoints. The shift between the source (e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. cameras) domains may lead to a significant decline in recognition accuracy. Additionally, state-of-the-art CNNs may not be suitable for such real-time applications given their computational requirements. Although several techniques have recently been proposed to address domain shift problems through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or to accelerate/compress CNNs through knowledge distillation (KD), we seek to simultaneously adapt and compress CNNs to generalize well across multiple target domains. In this paper, we propose a progressive KD approach for unsupervised single-target DA (STDA) and multi-target DA (MTDA) of CNNs. Our method for KD-STDA adapts a CNN to a single target domain by distilling from a larger teacher CNN, trained on both target and source domain data in order to maintain its consistency with a common representation. Our proposed approach is compared against state-of-the-art methods for compression and STDA of CNNs on the Office31 and ImageClef-DA image classification datasets. It is also compared against state-of-the-art methods for MTDA on Digits, Office31, and OfficeHome. In both settings -- KD-STDA and KD-MTDA -- results indicate that our approach can achieve the highest level of accuracy across target domains, while requiring a comparable or lower CNN complexity.

**Abstract:** Gauge invariance plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics from condensed matter physics to high energy physics. We develop an approach to constructing gauge invariant autoregressive neural networks for quantum lattice models. These networks can be efficiently sampled and explicitly obey gauge symmetries. We variationally optimize our gauge invariant autoregressive neural networks for ground states as well as real-time dynamics for a variety of models. We exactly represent the ground and excited states of the 2D and 3D toric codes, and the X-cube fracton model. We simulate the dynamics and the gound states of the quantum link model of $\text{U(1)}$ lattice gauge theory, obtain the phase diagram for the 2D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, determine the phase transition and the central charge of the $\text{SU(2)}_3$ anyonic chain, and also compute the ground state energy of the SU(2) invariant Heisenberg spin chain. Our approach provides powerful tools for exploring condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science.

**Abstract:** Annotated data has become the most important bottleneck in training accurate machine learning models, especially for areas that require domain expertise. A recent approach to deal with the above issue proposes using natural language explanations instead of labeling individual data points, thereby increasing human annotators' efficiency as well as decreasing costs substantially. This paper focuses on the task of turning these natural language descriptions into Python labeling functions by following a novel approach to semantic parsing with pre-trained text-to-text Transformers. In a series of experiments our approach achieves a new state of the art on the semantic parsing benchmark CoNaLa, surpassing the previous best approach by 3.7 BLEU points. Furthermore, on a manually constructed dataset of natural language descriptions-labeling functions pairs we achieve a BLEU of 0.39. Our approach can be regarded as a stepping stone towards models that are taught how to label in natural language, instead of being provided specific labeled samples. Our code, constructed dataset and models are available at https://github.com/ypapanik/t5-for-code-generation.

**Abstract:** Amortised inference enables scalable learning of sequential latent-variable models (LVMs) with the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In this setting, variational posteriors are often only partially conditioned. While the true posteriors depend, e.g., on the entire sequence of observations, approximate posteriors are only informed by past observations. This mimics the Bayesian filter -- a mixture of smoothing posteriors. Yet, we show that the ELBO objective forces partially-conditioned amortised posteriors to approximate products of smoothing posteriors instead. Consequently, the learned generative model is compromised. We demonstrate these theoretical findings in three scenarios: traffic flow, handwritten digits, and aerial vehicle dynamics. Using fully-conditioned approximate posteriors, performance improves in terms of generative modelling and multi-step prediction.

**Abstract:** Entropic regularization of policies in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a commonly used heuristic to ensure that the learned policy explores the state-space sufficiently before overfitting to a local optimal policy. The primary motivation for using entropy is for exploration and disambiguating optimal policies; however, the theoretical effects are not entirely understood. In this work, we study the more general regularized RL objective and using Fenchel duality; we derive the dual problem which takes the form of an adversarial reward problem. In particular, we find that the optimal policy found by a regularized objective is precisely an optimal policy of a reinforcement learning problem under a worst-case adversarial reward. Our result allows us to reinterpret the popular entropic regularization scheme as a form of robustification. Furthermore, due to the generality of our results, we apply to other existing regularization schemes. Our results thus give insights into the effects of regularization of policies and deepen our understanding of exploration through robust rewards at large.

**Abstract:** Visual steel surface defect detection is an essential step in steel sheet manufacturing. Several machine learning-based automated visual inspection (AVI) methods have been studied in recent years. However, most steel manufacturing industries still use manual visual inspection due to training time and inaccuracies involved with AVI methods. Automatic steel defect detection methods could be useful in less expensive and faster quality control and feedback. But preparing the annotated training data for segmentation and classification could be a costly process. In this work, we propose to use the Transfer Learning-based U-Net (TLU-Net) framework for steel surface defect detection. We use a U-Net architecture as the base and explore two kinds of encoders: ResNet and DenseNet. We compare these nets' performance using random initialization and the pre-trained networks trained using the ImageNet data set. The experiments are performed using Severstal data. The results demonstrate that the transfer learning performs 5% (absolute) better than that of the random initialization in defect classification. We found that the transfer learning performs 26% (relative) better than that of the random initialization in defect segmentation. We also found the gain of transfer learning increases as the training data decreases, and the convergence rate with transfer learning is better than that of the random initialization.

**Abstract:** In recent years, a variety of tasks have been accomplished by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, when applying DRL to tasks in a real-world environment, designing an appropriate reward is difficult. Rewards obtained via actual hardware sensors may include noise, misinterpretation, or failed observations. The learning instability caused by these unstable signals is a problem that remains to be solved in DRL. In this work, we propose an approach that extends existing DRL models by adding a subtask to directly estimate the variance contained in the reward signal. The model then takes the feature map learned by the subtask in a critic network and sends it to the actor network. This enables stable learning that is robust to the effects of potential noise. The results of experiments in the Atari game domain with unstable reward signals show that our method stabilizes training convergence. We also discuss the extensibility of the model by visualizing feature maps. This approach has the potential to make DRL more practical for use in noisy, real-world scenarios.

**Abstract:** Surveillance scenarios are prone to several problems since they usually involve low-resolution footage, and there is no control of how far the subjects may be from the camera in the first place. This situation is suitable for the application of upsampling (super-resolution) algorithms since they may be able to recover the discriminant properties of the subjects involved. While general super-resolution approaches were proposed to enhance image quality for human-level perception, biometrics super-resolution methods seek the best "computer perception" version of the image since their focus is on improving automatic recognition performance. Convolutional neural networks and deep learning algorithms, in general, have been applied to computer vision tasks and are now state-of-the-art for several sub-domains, including image classification, restoration, and super-resolution. However, no work has evaluated the effects that the latest proposed super-resolution methods may have upon the accuracy and face verification performance in low-resolution "in-the-wild" data. This project aimed at evaluating and adapting different deep neural network architectures for the task of face super-resolution driven by face recognition performance in real-world low-resolution images. The experimental results in a real-world surveillance and attendance datasets showed that general super-resolution architectures might enhance face verification performance of deep neural networks trained on high-resolution faces. Also, since neural networks are function approximators and can be trained based on specific objective functions, the use of a customized loss function optimized for feature extraction showed promising results for recovering discriminant features in low-resolution face images.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a new algorithm, named Householder Dice (HD), for simulating dynamics on dense random matrix ensembles with translation-invariant properties. Examples include the Gaussian ensemble, the Haar-distributed random orthogonal ensemble, and their complex-valued counterparts. A "direct" approach to the simulation, where one first generates a dense $n \times n$ matrix from the ensemble, requires at least $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ resource in space and time. The HD algorithm overcomes this $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ bottleneck by using the principle of deferred decisions: rather than fixing the entire random matrix in advance, it lets the randomness unfold with the dynamics. At the heart of this matrix-free algorithm is an adaptive and recursive construction of (random) Householder reflectors. These orthogonal transformations exploit the group symmetry of the matrix ensembles, while simultaneously maintaining the statistical correlations induced by the dynamics. The memory and computation costs of the HD algorithm are $\mathcal{O}(nT)$ and $\mathcal{O}(nT^2)$, respectively, with $T$ being the number of iterations. When $T \ll n$, which is nearly always the case in practice, the new algorithm leads to significant reductions in runtime and memory footprint. Numerical results demonstrate the promise of the HD algorithm as a new computational tool in the study of high-dimensional random systems.

**Abstract:** As a new generation of Public Bicycle-sharing Systems (PBS), the dockless PBS (DL-PBS) is an important application of cyber-physical systems and intelligent transportation. How to use AI to provide efficient bicycle dispatching solutions based on dynamic bicycle rental demand is an essential issue for DL-PBS. In this paper, we propose a dynamic bicycle dispatching algorithm based on multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL-BD) to provide the optimal bicycle dispatching solution for DL-PBS. We model the DL-PBS system from the perspective of CPS and use deep learning to predict the layout of bicycle parking spots and the dynamic demand of bicycle dispatching. We define the multi-route bicycle dispatching problem as a multi-objective optimization problem by considering the optimization objectives of dispatching costs, dispatch truck's initial load, workload balance among the trucks, and the dynamic balance of bicycle supply and demand. On this basis, the collaborative multi-route bicycle dispatching problem among multiple dispatch trucks is modeled as a multi-agent MORL model. All dispatch paths between parking spots are defined as state spaces, and the reciprocal of dispatching costs is defined as a reward. Each dispatch truck is equipped with an agent to learn the optimal dispatch path in the dynamic DL-PBS network. We create an elite list to store the Pareto optimal solutions of bicycle dispatch paths found in each action, and finally, get the Pareto frontier. Experimental results on the actual DL-PBS systems show that compared with existing methods, MORL-BD can find a higher quality Pareto frontier with less execution time.

**Abstract:** Random-walk based network embedding algorithms like node2vec and DeepWalk are widely used to obtain Euclidean representation of the nodes in a network prior to performing down-stream network inference tasks. Nevertheless, despite their impressive empirical performance, there is a lack of theoretical results explaining their behavior. In this paper we studied the node2vec and DeepWalk algorithms through the perspective of matrix factorization. We analyze these algorithms in the setting of community detection for stochastic blockmodel graphs; in particular we established large-sample error bounds and prove consistent community recovery of node2vec/DeepWalk embedding followed by k-means clustering. Our theoretical results indicate a subtle interplay between the sparsity of the observed networks, the window sizes of the random walks, and the convergence rates of the node2vec/DeepWalk embedding toward the embedding of the true but unknown edge probabilities matrix. More specifically, as the network becomes sparser, our results suggest using larger window sizes, or equivalently, taking longer random walks, in order to attain better convergence rate for the resulting embeddings. The paper includes numerical experiments corroborating these observations.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning is a model-free optimal control method that optimizes a control policy through direct interaction with the environment. For reaching tasks that end in regulation, popular discrete-action methods are not well suited due to chattering in the goal state. We compare three different ways to solve this problem through combining reinforcement learning with classical LQR control. In particular, we introduce a method that integrates LQR control into the action set, allowing generalization and avoiding fixing the computed control in the replay memory if it is based on learned dynamics. We also embed LQR control into a continuous-action method. In all cases, we show that adding LQR control can improve performance, although the effect is more profound if it can be used to augment a discrete action set.

**Abstract:** Abstractive Text Summarization is the process of constructing semantically relevant shorter sentences which captures the essence of the overall meaning of the source text. It is actually difficult and very time consuming for humans to summarize manually large documents of text. Much of work in abstractive text summarization is being done in English and almost no significant work has been reported in Telugu abstractive text summarization. So, we would like to propose an abstractive text summarization approach for Telugu language using Deep learning. In this paper we are proposing an abstractive text summarization Deep learning model for Telugu language. The proposed architecture is based on encoder-decoder sequential models with attention mechanism. We have applied this model on manually created dataset to generate a one sentence summary of the source text and have got good results measured qualitatively.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained models (PTMs) have been widely used in various downstream tasks. The parameters of PTMs are distributed on the Internet and may suffer backdoor attacks. In this work, we demonstrate the universal vulnerability of PTMs, where fine-tuned PTMs can be easily controlled by backdoor attacks in arbitrary downstream tasks. Specifically, attackers can add a simple pre-training task, which restricts the output representations of trigger instances to pre-defined vectors, namely neuron-level backdoor attack (NeuBA). If the backdoor functionality is not eliminated during fine-tuning, the triggers can make the fine-tuned model predict fixed labels by pre-defined vectors. In the experiments of both natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), we show that NeuBA absolutely controls the predictions for trigger instances without any knowledge of downstream tasks. Finally, we apply several defense methods to NeuBA and find that model pruning is a promising direction to resist NeuBA by excluding backdoored neurons. Our findings sound a red alarm for the wide use of PTMs. Our source code and models are available at \url{https://github.com/thunlp/NeuBA}.

**Abstract:** Recently proposed consistency-based Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods such as the $Œ†$-model, temporal ensembling, the mean teacher, or the virtual adversarial training, have advanced the state of the art in several SSL tasks. These methods can typically reach performances that are comparable to their fully supervised counterparts while using only a fraction of labelled examples. Despite these methodological advances, the understanding of these methods is still relatively limited. In this text, we analyse (variations of) the $Œ†$-model in settings where analytically tractable results can be obtained. We establish links with Manifold Tangent Classifiers and demonstrate that the quality of the perturbations is key to obtaining reasonable SSL performances. Importantly, we propose a simple extension of the Hidden Manifold Model that naturally incorporates data-augmentation schemes and offers a framework for understanding and experimenting with SSL methods.

**Abstract:** With the wide use of deep neural networks (DNN), model interpretability has become a critical concern, since explainable decisions are preferred in high-stake scenarios. Current interpretation techniques mainly focus on the feature attribution perspective, which are limited in indicating why and how particular explanations are related to the prediction. To this end, an intriguing class of explanations, named counterfactuals, has been developed to further explore the "what-if" circumstances for interpretation, and enables the reasoning capability on black-box models. However, generating counterfactuals for raw data instances (i.e., text and image) is still in the early stage due to its challenges on high data dimensionality and unsemantic raw features. In this paper, we design a framework to generate counterfactuals specifically for raw data instances with the proposed Attribute-Informed Perturbation (AIP). By utilizing generative models conditioned with different attributes, counterfactuals with desired labels can be obtained effectively and efficiently. Instead of directly modifying instances in the data space, we iteratively optimize the constructed attribute-informed latent space, where features are more robust and semantic. Experimental results on real-world texts and images demonstrate the effectiveness, sample quality as well as efficiency of our designed framework, and show the superiority over other alternatives. Besides, we also introduce some practical applications based on our framework, indicating its potential beyond the model interpretability aspect.

**Abstract:** Automatic pulmonary nodules classification is significant for early diagnosis of lung cancers. Recently, deep learning techniques have enabled remarkable progress in this field. However, these deep models are typically of high computational complexity and work in a black-box manner. To combat these challenges, in this work, we aim to build an efficient and (partially) explainable classification model. Specially, we use \emph{neural architecture search} (NAS) to automatically search 3D network architectures with excellent accuracy/speed trade-off. Besides, we use the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) in the networks, which helps us understand the reasoning process. During training, we use A-Softmax loss to learn angularly discriminative representations. In the inference stage, we employ an ensemble of diverse neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIDC-IDRI database. Compared with previous state-of-the-art, our model shows highly comparable performance by using less than 1/40 parameters. Besides, empirical study shows that the reasoning process of learned networks is in conformity with physicians' diagnosis.

**Abstract:** The diagnosis of prostate cancer is challenging due to the heterogeneity of its presentations, leading to the over diagnosis and treatment of non-clinically important disease. Accurate diagnosis can directly benefit a patient's quality of life and prognosis. Towards addressing this issue, we present a learning model for the automatic identification of prostate cancer. While many prostate cancer studies have adopted Raman spectroscopy approaches, none have utilised the combination of Raman Chemical Imaging (RCI) and other imaging modalities. This study uses multimodal images formed from stained Digital Histopathology (DP) and unstained RCI. The approach was developed and tested on a set of 178 clinical samples from 32 patients, containing a range of non-cancerous, Gleason grade 3 (G3) and grade 4 (G4) tissue microarray samples. For each histological sample, there is a pathologist labelled DP - RCI image pair. The hypothesis tested was whether multimodal image models can outperform single modality baseline models in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Binary non-cancer/cancer models and the more challenging G3/G4 differentiation were investigated. Regarding G3/G4 classification, the multimodal approach achieved a sensitivity of 73.8% and specificity of 88.1% while the baseline DP model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 54.1% and 84.7% respectively. The multimodal approach demonstrated a statistically significant 12.7% AUC advantage over the baseline with a value of 85.8% compared to 73.1%, also outperforming models based solely on RCI and median Raman spectra. Feature fusion of DP and RCI does not improve the more trivial task of tumour identification but does deliver an observed advantage in G3/G4 discrimination. Building on these promising findings, future work could include the acquisition of larger datasets for enhanced model generalization.

**Abstract:** Optical colonoscopy (OC), the most prevalent colon cancer screening tool, has a high miss rate due to a number of factors, including the geometry of the colon (haustral fold and sharp bends occlusions), endoscopist inexperience or fatigue, endoscope field of view, etc. We present a framework to visualize the missed regions per-frame during the colonoscopy, and provides a workable clinical solution. Specifically, we make use of 3D reconstructed virtual colonoscopy (VC) data and the insight that VC and OC share the same underlying geometry but differ in color, texture and specular reflections, embedded in the OC domain. A lossy unpaired image-to-image translation model is introduced with enforced shared latent space for OC and VC. This shared latent space captures the geometric information while deferring the color, texture, and specular information creation to additional Gaussian noise input. This additional noise input can be utilized to generate one-to-many mappings from VC to OC and OC to OC. The code, data and trained models will be released via our Computational Endoscopy Platform at https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP.

**Abstract:** Despite the increasing importance of strain localization modeling (e.g., failure analysis) in computer-aided engineering, there is a lack of effective approaches to capturing relevant material behaviors consistently across multiple length scales. We aim to address this gap within the framework of deep material networks (DMN) -- a machine learning model with embedded mechanics in the building blocks. A new cell-division scheme is proposed to track the scale transition through the network, and its consistency is ensured by the physics of fitting parameters. Essentially, each microscale node in the bottom layer is described by an ellipsoidal cell with its dimensions back-propagated from the macroscale material point. New crack surfaces in the cell are modeled by enriching cohesive layers, and failure algorithms are developed for crack initiation and evolution in the implicit DMN analysis. Besides studies on a single material point, we apply the multiscale model to concurrent multiscale simulations for the dynamic crush of a particle-reinforced composite tube and various tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. For the latter, experimental validations on an off-axis tensile test specimen are also provided.

**Abstract:** Digital image processing techniques have wide applications in different scientific fields including the medicine. By use of image processing algorithms, physicians have been more successful in diagnosis of different diseases and have achieved much better treatment results. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for segmenting the skin lesions and extracting features that are associated to them. At this aim, a combination of Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) and Active Contour Model (ACM), is used. In the suggested method, at first region of skin lesion is segmented from the whole skin image, and then some features like the mean, variance, RGB and HSV parameters are extracted from the segmented region. Comparing the segmentation results, by use of Otsu thresholding, our proposed method, shows the superiority of our procedure over the Otsu theresholding method. Segmentation of the skin lesion by the proposed method and Otsu thresholding compared the results with physician's manual method. The proposed method for skin lesion segmentation, which is a combination of SURF and ACM, gives the best result. For empirical evaluation of our method, we have applied it on twenty different skin lesion images. Obtained results confirm the high performance, speed and accuracy of our method.

**Abstract:** A promising approach toward efficient energy management is non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), that is to extract the consumption profiles of appliances within a residence by analyzing the aggregated consumption signal. Among efficient NILM methods are event-based algorithms in which events of the aggregated signal are detected and classified in accordance with the appliances causing them. The large number of appliances and the presence of appliances with close consumption values are known to limit the performance of event-based NILM methods. To tackle these challenges, one could enhance the feature space which in turn results in extra hardware costs, installation complexity, and concerns regarding the consumer's comfort and privacy. This has led to the emergence of an alternative approach, namely semi-intrusive load monitoring (SILM), where appliances are partitioned into blocks and the consumption of each block is monitored via separate power meters.
  While a greater number of meters can result in more accurate disaggregation, it increases the monetary cost of load monitoring, indicating a trade-off that represents an important gap in this field. In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to close this gap by establishing a so-called notion of "disaggregation difficulty metric (DDM)," which quantifies how difficult it is to monitor the events of any given group of appliances based on both their power values and the consumer's usage behavior. Thus, DDM in essence quantifies how much is expected to be gained in terms of disaggregation accuracy of a generic event-based algorithm by installing meters on the blocks of any partition of the appliances. Experimental results based on the REDD dataset illustrate the practicality of the proposed approach in addressing the aforementioned trade-off.

**Abstract:** Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) as the process of extracting the usage pattern of appliances from the aggregated power signal is among successful approaches aiding residential energy management. In recent years, high volume datasets on power profiles have become available, which has helped make classification methods employed for the NILM purpose more effective and more accurate. However, the presence of multi-mode appliances and appliances with close power values have remained influential in worsening the computational complexity and diminishing the accuracy of these algorithms. To tackle these challenges, we propose an event-based classification process, in the first phase of which the $K$-nearest neighbors method, as a fast classification technique, is employed to extract power signals of appliances with exclusive non-overlapping power values. Then, two deep learning models, which consider the water consumption of some appliances as a novel signature in the network, are utilized to distinguish between appliances with overlapping power values. In addition to power disaggregation, the proposed process as well extracts the water consumption profiles of specific appliances. To illustrate the proposed process and validate its efficiency, seven appliances of the AMPds are considered, with the numerical classification results showing marked improvement with respect to the existing classification-based NILM techniques.

**Abstract:** We introduce the problem of maximizing approximately $k$-submodular functions subject to size constraints. In this problem, one seeks to select $k$-disjoint subsets of a ground set with bounded total size or individual sizes, and maximum utility, given by a function that is "close" to being $k$-submodular. The problem finds applications in tasks such as sensor placement, where one wishes to install $k$ types of sensors whose measurements are noisy, and influence maximization, where one seeks to advertise $k$ topics to users of a social network whose level of influence is uncertain. To deal with the problem, we first provide two natural definitions for approximately $k$-submodular functions and establish a hierarchical relationship between them. Next, we show that simple greedy algorithms offer approximation guarantees for different types of size constraints. Last, we demonstrate experimentally that the greedy algorithms are effective in sensor placement and influence maximization problems.

**Abstract:** Specification synthesis is the process of deriving a model from the input-output traces of a system. It is used extensively in test design, reverse engineering, and system identification. One type of the resulting artifact of this process for cyber-physical systems is hybrid automata. They are intuitive, precise, tool independent, and at a high level of abstraction, and can model systems with both discrete and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose a new technique for synthesizing hybrid automaton from the input-output traces of a non-linear cyber-physical system. Similarity detection in non-linear behaviors is the main challenge for extracting such models. We address this problem by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping technique. Our approach is passive, meaning that it does not need interaction with the system during automata synthesis from the logged traces; and online, which means that each input/output trace is used only once in the procedure. In other words, each new trace can be used to improve the already synthesized automaton. We evaluated our algorithm in two industrial and simulated case studies. The accuracy of the derived automata show promising results.

**Abstract:** We consider the classical uncoded caching problem from an online learning point-of-view. A cache of limited storage capacity can hold $C$ files at a time from a large catalog. A user requests an arbitrary file from the catalog at each time slot. Before the file request from the user arrives, a caching policy populates the cache with any $C$ files of its choice. In the case of a cache-hit, the policy receives a unit reward and zero rewards otherwise. In addition to that, there is a cost associated with fetching files to the cache, which we refer to as the switching cost. The objective is to design a caching policy that incurs minimal regret while considering both the rewards due to cache-hits and the switching cost due to the file fetches. The main contribution of this paper is the switching regret analysis of a Follow the Perturbed Leader-based anytime caching policy, which is shown to have an order optimal switching regret. In this pursuit, we improve the best-known switching regret bound for this problem by a factor of $Œò(\sqrt{C}).$ We conclude the paper by comparing the performance of different popular caching policies using a publicly available trace from a commercial CDN server.

**Abstract:** Facial image inpainting is a challenging problem as it requires generating new pixels that include semantic information for masked key components in a face, e.g., eyes and nose. Recently, remarkable methods have been proposed in this field. Most of these approaches use encoder-decoder architectures and have different limitations such as allowing unique results for a given image and a particular mask. Alternatively, some approaches generate promising results using different masks with generator networks. However, these approaches are optimization-based and usually require quite a number of iterations. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to the facial image painting problem using the Cyclic Reverse Generator (CRG) architecture, which provides an encoder-generator model. We use the encoder to embed a given image to the generator space and incrementally inpaint the masked regions until a plausible image is generated; a discriminator network is utilized to assess the generated images during the iterations. We empirically observed that only a few iterations are sufficient to generate realistic images with the proposed model. After the generation process, for the post processing, we utilize a Unet model that we trained specifically for this task to remedy the artifacts close to the mask boundaries. Our method allows applying sketch-based inpaintings, using variety of mask types, and producing multiple and diverse results. We qualitatively compared our method with the state-of-the-art models and observed that our method can compete with the other models in all mask types; it is particularly better in images where larger masks are utilized.

**Abstract:** In this study optical flow method was used for soil small deformation measurement in laboratory tests. The main objective was to observe how the deformation distributes along the whole height of cylindrical soil specimen subjected to torsional shearing (TS test). The experiments were conducted on dry non-cohesive soil specimens under two values of isotropic pressure. Specimens were loaded with low-amplitude cyclic torque to analyze the deformation within the small strain range (0.001-0.01%). Optical flow method variant by Ce Liu (2009) was used for motion estimation from series of images. This algorithm uses scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) for image feature extraction and coarse-to-fine matching scheme for faster calculations. The results were validated with the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The results show that the displacement distribution deviates from commonly assumed linearity. Moreover, the observed deformation mechanisms analysis suggest that the shear modulus $G$ commonly determined through TS tests can be considerably overestimated.

**Abstract:** Along with rich health-related metadata, medical images have been acquired for over 40,000 male and female UK Biobank participants, aged 44-82, since 2014. Phenotypes derived from these images, such as measurements of body composition from MRI, can reveal new links between genetics, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic conditions. In this work, six measurements of body composition and adipose tissues were automatically estimated by image-based, deep regression with ResNet50 neural networks from neck-to-knee body MRI. Despite the potential for high speed and accuracy, these networks produce no output segmentations that could indicate the reliability of individual measurements. The presented experiments therefore examine uncertainty quantification with mean-variance regression and ensembling to estimate individual measurement errors and thereby identify potential outliers, anomalies, and other failure cases automatically. In 10-fold cross-validation on data of about 8,500 subjects, mean-variance regression and ensembling showed complementary benefits, reducing the mean absolute error across all predictions by 12%. Both improved the calibration of uncertainties and their ability to identify high prediction errors. With intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) above 0.97, all targets except the liver fat content yielded relative measurement errors below 5%. Testing on another 1,000 subjects showed consistent performance, and the method was finally deployed for inference to 30,000 subjects with missing reference values. The results indicate that deep regression ensembles could ultimately provide automated, uncertainty-aware measurements of body composition for more than 120,000 UK Biobank neck-to-knee body MRI that are to be acquired within the coming years.

**Abstract:** Computed tomography (CT) image provides useful information for radiologists to diagnose Covid-19. However, visual analysis of CT scans is time-consuming. Thus, it is necessary to develop algorithms for automatic Covid-19 detection from CT images. In this paper, we propose a belief function-based convolutional neural network with semi-supervised training to detect Covid-19 cases. Our method first extracts deep features, maps them into belief degree maps and makes the final classification decision. Our results are more reliable and explainable than those of traditional deep learning-based classification models. Experimental results show that our approach is able to achieve a good performance with an accuracy of 0.81, an F1 of 0.812 and an AUC of 0.875.

**Abstract:** The standard model and the bandit model are two generalizations of the mistake-bound model to online multiclass classification. In both models the learner guesses a classification in each round, but in the standard model the learner recieves the correct classification after each guess, while in the bandit model the learner is only told whether or not their guess is correct in each round. For any set $F$ of multiclass classifiers, define $opt_{std}(F)$ and $opt_{bandit}(F)$ to be the optimal worst-case number of prediction mistakes in the standard and bandit models respectively.
  Long (Theoretical Computer Science, 2020) claimed that for all $M > 2$ and infinitely many $k$, there exists a set $F$ of functions from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ of size $k$ such that $opt_{std}(F) = M$ and $opt_{bandit}(F) \ge (1 - o(1))(|Y|\ln{|Y|})opt_{std}(F)$. The proof of this result depended on the following lemma, which is false e.g. for all prime $p \ge 5$, $s = \mathbf{1}$ (the all $1$ vector), $t = \mathbf{2}$ (the all $2$ vector), and all $z$.
  Lemma: Fix $n \ge 2$ and prime $p$, and let $u$ be chosen uniformly at random from $\left\{0, \dots, p-1\right\}^n$. For any $s, t \in \left\{1, \dots, p-1\right\}^n$ with $s \neq t$ and for any $z \in \left\{0, \dots, p-1\right\}$, we have $\Pr(t \cdot u = z \mod p \text{ } | \text{ } s \cdot u = z \mod p) = \frac{1}{p}$.
  We show that this lemma is false precisely when $s$ and $t$ are multiples of each other mod $p$. Then using a new lemma, we fix Long's proof.

**Abstract:** Recent years saw a plethora of work on explaining complex intelligent agents. One example is the development of several algorithms that generate saliency maps which show how much each pixel attributed to the agents' decision. However, most evaluations of such saliency maps focus on image classification tasks. As far as we know, there is no work that thoroughly compares different saliency maps for Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. This paper compares four perturbation-based approaches to create saliency maps for Deep Reinforcement Learning agents trained on four different Atari 2600 games. All four approaches work by perturbing parts of the input and measuring how much this affects the agent's output. The approaches are compared using three computational metrics: dependence on the learned parameters of the agent (sanity checks), faithfulness to the agent's reasoning (input degradation), and run-time. In particular, during the sanity checks we find issues with two approaches and propose a solution to fix one of those issues.

**Abstract:** In this work, we introduce the unsupervised Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier for learning visual dictionaries in the context of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and automatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis. The proposed approach was validated in two datasets (MICCAI 2015 and Augsburg) using three different feature extractors (SIFT, SURF, and the not yet applied to the BE context A-KAZE), as well as five supervised classifiers, including two variants of the OPF, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function and Linear kernels, and a Bayesian classifier. Concerning MICCAI 2015 dataset, the best results were obtained using unsupervised OPF for dictionary generation using supervised OPF for classification purposes and using SURF feature extractor with accuracy nearly to 78% for distinguishing BE patients from adenocarcinoma ones. Regarding the Augsburg dataset, the most accurate results were also obtained using both OPF classifiers but with A-KAZE as the feature extractor with accuracy close to 73%. The combination of feature extraction and bag-of-visual-words techniques showed results that outperformed others obtained recently in the literature, as well as we highlight new advances in the related research area. Reinforcing the significance of this work, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first one that aimed at addressing computer-aided BE identification using bag-of-visual-words and OPF classifiers, being this application of unsupervised technique in the BE feature calculation the major contribution of this work. It is also proposed a new BE and adenocarcinoma description using the A-KAZE features, not yet applied in the literature.

**Abstract:** Human-AI collaborative policy synthesis is a procedure in which (1) a human initializes an autonomous agent's behavior, (2) Reinforcement Learning improves the human specified behavior, and (3) the agent can explain the final optimized policy to the user. This paradigm leverages human expertise and facilitates a greater insight into the learned behaviors of an agent. Existing approaches to enabling collaborative policy specification involve black box methods which are unintelligible and are not catered towards non-expert end-users. In this paper, we develop a novel collaborative framework to enable humans to initialize and interpret an autonomous agent's behavior, rooted in principles of human-centered design. Through our framework, we enable humans to specify an initial behavior model in the form of unstructured, natural language, which we then convert to lexical decision trees. Next, we are able to leverage these human-specified policies, to warm-start reinforcement learning and further allow the agent to optimize the policies through reinforcement learning. Finally, to close the loop on human-specification, we produce explanations of the final learned policy, in multiple modalities, to provide the user a final depiction about the learned policy of the agent. We validate our approach by showing that our model can produce >80% accuracy, and that human-initialized policies are able to successfully warm-start RL. We then conduct a novel human-subjects study quantifying the relative subjective and objective benefits of varying XAI modalities(e.g., Tree, Language, and Program) for explaining learned policies to end-users, in terms of usability and interpretability and identify the circumstances that influence these measures. Our findings emphasize the need for personalized explainable systems that can facilitate user-centric policy explanations for a variety of end-users.

**Abstract:** Face parsing infers a pixel-wise label to each facial component, which has drawn much attention recently. Previous methods have shown their success in face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among facial components. As a matter of fact, the component-wise relationship is a critical clue in discriminating ambiguous pixels in facial area. To address this issue, we propose adaptive graph representation learning and reasoning over facial components, aiming to learn representative vertices that describe each component, exploit the component-wise relationship and thereby produce accurate parsing results against ambiguity. In particular, we devise an adaptive and differentiable graph abstraction method to represent the components on a graph via pixel-to-vertex projection under the initial condition of a predicted parsing map, where pixel features within a certain facial region are aggregated onto a vertex. Further, we explicitly incorporate the image edge as a prior in the model, which helps to discriminate edge and non-edge pixels during the projection, thus leading to refined parsing results along the edges. Then, our model learns and reasons over the relations among components by propagating information across vertices on the graph. Finally, the refined vertex features are projected back to pixel grids for the prediction of the final parsing map. To train our model, we propose a discriminative loss to penalize small distances between vertices in the feature space, which leads to distinct vertices with strong semantics. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed model on multiple face parsing datasets, along with the validation on the human parsing task to demonstrate the generalizability of our model.

**Abstract:** Thermal images can be obtained as either grayscale images or pseudo colored images based on the thermal profile of the object being captured. In this work, we explore what an optimal encoder decoder might look like for creating a thermal-optical fused domain image. We compare the results from several different encoder-decoder structures with different networks to answer this question. This output images obtained from our method provides information of both domains jointly in a colorized image. We call this a cross domain colorized image. We also present a robust registration method for thermal and optical pairs, which can work despite changes in resolution and the make of the thermal imager. Lastly, we present a unique public dataset with registered thermal-visual image pairs containing around 1800 images as a part of this work, collected over a period of 2 years. We compare our results with prior literature, show how our results are different and discuss on some future work that can be explored further in this domain.
