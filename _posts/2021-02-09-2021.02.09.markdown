**Abstract:** This graduate textbook on machine learning tells a story of how patterns in data support predictions and consequential actions. Starting with the foundations of decision making, we cover representation, optimization, and generalization as the constituents of supervised learning. A chapter on datasets as benchmarks examines their histories and scientific bases. Self-contained introductions to causality, the practice of causal inference, sequential decision making, and reinforcement learning equip the reader with concepts and tools to reason about actions and their consequences. Throughout, the text discusses historical context and societal impact. We invite readers from all backgrounds; some experience with probability, calculus, and linear algebra suffices.

**Abstract:** In this work we present a novel, robust transition generation technique that can serve as a new tool for 3D animators, based on adversarial recurrent neural networks. The system synthesizes high-quality motions that use temporally-sparse keyframes as animation constraints. This is reminiscent of the job of in-betweening in traditional animation pipelines, in which an animator draws motion frames between provided keyframes. We first show that a state-of-the-art motion prediction model cannot be easily converted into a robust transition generator when only adding conditioning information about future keyframes. To solve this problem, we then propose two novel additive embedding modifiers that are applied at each timestep to latent representations encoded inside the network's architecture. One modifier is a time-to-arrival embedding that allows variations of the transition length with a single model. The other is a scheduled target noise vector that allows the system to be robust to target distortions and to sample different transitions given fixed keyframes. To qualitatively evaluate our method, we present a custom MotionBuilder plugin that uses our trained model to perform in-betweening in production scenarios. To quantitatively evaluate performance on transitions and generalizations to longer time horizons, we present well-defined in-betweening benchmarks on a subset of the widely used Human3.6M dataset and on LaFAN1, a novel high quality motion capture dataset that is more appropriate for transition generation. We are releasing this new dataset along with this work, with accompanying code for reproducing our baseline results.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation is often used to enlarge datasets with synthetic samples generated in accordance with the underlying data distribution. To enable a wider range of augmentations, we explore negative data augmentation strategies (NDA)that intentionally create out-of-distribution samples. We show that such negative out-of-distribution samples provide information on the support of the data distribution, and can be leveraged for generative modeling and representation learning. We introduce a new GAN training objective where we use NDA as an additional source of synthetic data for the discriminator. We prove that under suitable conditions, optimizing the resulting objective still recovers the true data distribution but can directly bias the generator towards avoiding samples that lack the desired structure. Empirically, models trained with our method achieve improved conditional/unconditional image generation along with improved anomaly detection capabilities. Further, we incorporate the same negative data augmentation strategy in a contrastive learning framework for self-supervised representation learning on images and videos, achieving improved performance on downstream image classification, object detection, and action recognition tasks. These results suggest that prior knowledge on what does not constitute valid data is an effective form of weak supervision across a range of unsupervised learning tasks.

**Abstract:** Efficient optimization of resources is paramount to success in many problems faced today. In the field of operational research the efficient scheduling of employees; packing of vans; routing of vehicles; logistics of airlines and transport of materials can be the difference between emission reduction or excess, profits or losses and feasibility or unworkable solutions. The video game Factorio, by Wube Software, has a myriad of problems which are analogous to such real-world problems, and is a useful simulator for developing solutions for these problems. In this paper we define the logistic transport belt problem and define mathematical integer programming model of it. We developed an interface to allow optimizers in any programming language to interact with Factorio, and we provide an initial benchmark of logistic transport belt problems. We present results for Simulated Annealing, quick Genetic Programming and Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning, three different meta-heuristic techniques to optimize this novel problem.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of explaining the predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs), which otherwise are considered as black boxes. Existing methods invariably focus on explaining the importance of graph nodes or edges but ignore the substructures of graphs, which are more intuitive and human-intelligible. In this work, we propose a novel method, known as SubgraphX, to explain GNNs by identifying important subgraphs. Given a trained GNN model and an input graph, our SubgraphX explains its predictions by efficiently exploring different subgraphs with Monte Carlo tree search. To make the tree search more effective, we propose to use Shapley values as a measure of subgraph importance, which can also capture the interactions among different subgraphs. To expedite computations, we propose efficient approximation schemes to compute Shapley values for graph data. Our work represents the first attempt to explain GNNs via identifying subgraphs explicitly and directly. Experimental results show that our SubgraphX achieves significantly improved explanations, while keeping computations at a reasonable level.

**Abstract:** A central component of training in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is Experience: the data used for training. The mechanisms used to generate and consume this data have an important effect on the performance of RL algorithms.
  In this paper, we introduce Reverb: an efficient, extensible, and easy to use system designed specifically for experience replay in RL. Reverb is designed to work efficiently in distributed configurations with up to thousands of concurrent clients.
  The flexible API provides users with the tools to easily and accurately configure the replay buffer. It includes strategies for selecting and removing elements from the buffer, as well as options for controlling the ratio between sampled and inserted elements. This paper presents the core design of Reverb, gives examples of how it can be applied, and provides empirical results of Reverb's performance characteristics.

**Abstract:** This paper looks into the modeling of hallucination in the human's brain. Hallucinations are known to be causally associated with some malfunctions within the interaction of different areas of the brain involved in perception. Focusing on visual hallucination and its underlying causes, we identify an adversarial mechanism between different parts of the brain which are responsible in the process of visual perception. We then show how the characterized adversarial interactions in the brain can be modeled by a generative adversarial network.

**Abstract:** In clinical practice, medical image interpretation often involves multi-labeled classification, since the affected parts of a patient tend to present multiple symptoms or comorbidities. Recently, deep learning based frameworks have attained expert-level performance on medical image interpretation, which can be attributed partially to large amounts of accurate annotations. However, manually annotating massive amounts of medical images is impractical, while automatic annotation is fast but imprecise (possibly introducing corrupted labels). In this work, we propose a new regularization approach, called Flow-Mixup, for multi-labeled medical image classification with corrupted labels. Flow-Mixup guides the models to capture robust features for each abnormality, thus helping handle corrupted labels effectively and making it possible to apply automatic annotation. Specifically, Flow-Mixup decouples the extracted features by adding constraints to the hidden states of the models. Also, Flow-Mixup is more stable and effective comparing to other known regularization methods, as shown by theoretical and empirical analyses. Experiments on two electrocardiogram datasets and a chest X-ray dataset containing corrupted labels verify that Flow-Mixup is effective and insensitive to corrupted labels.

**Abstract:** Generative models are typically trained on grid-like data such as images. As a result, the size of these models usually scales directly with the underlying grid resolution. In this paper, we abandon discretized grids and instead parameterize individual data points by continuous functions. We then build generative models by learning distributions over such functions. By treating data points as functions, we can abstract away from the specific type of data we train on and construct models that are agnostic to discretization. To train our model, we use an adversarial approach with a discriminator that acts on continuous signals. Through experiments on a wide variety of data modalities including images, 3D shapes and climate data, we demonstrate that our model can learn rich distributions of functions independently of data type and resolution.

**Abstract:** Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approaches rely on discrete-time state transition models whereas physical systems and the vast majority of control tasks operate in continuous-time. To avoid time-discretization approximation of the underlying process, we propose a continuous-time MBRL framework based on a novel actor-critic method. Our approach also infers the unknown state evolution differentials with Bayesian neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) to account for epistemic uncertainty. We implement and test our method on a new ODE-RL suite that explicitly solves continuous-time control systems. Our experiments illustrate that the model is robust against irregular and noisy data, is sample-efficient, and can solve control problems which pose challenges to discrete-time MBRL methods.

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) work well when the graph structure is provided. However, this structure may not always be available in real-world applications. One solution to this problem is to infer a task-specific latent structure and then apply a GNN to the inferred graph. Unfortunately, the space of possible graph structures grows super-exponentially with the number of nodes and so the task-specific supervision may be insufficient for learning both the structure and the GNN parameters. In this work, we propose the Simultaneous Learning of Adjacency and GNN Parameters with Self-supervision, or SLAPS, a method that provides more supervision for inferring a graph structure through self-supervision. A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that SLAPS scales to large graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes and outperforms several models that have been proposed to learn a task-specific graph structure on established benchmarks.

**Abstract:** We provide a general framework for studying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained by injecting noise into hidden states. Specifically, we consider RNNs that can be viewed as discretizations of stochastic differential equations driven by input data. This framework allows us to study the implicit regularization effect of general noise injection schemes by deriving an approximate explicit regularizer in the small noise regime. We find that, under reasonable assumptions, this implicit regularization promotes flatter minima; it biases towards models with more stable dynamics; and, in classification tasks, it favors models with larger classification margin. Sufficient conditions for global stability are obtained, highlighting the phenomenon of stochastic stabilization, where noise injection can improve stability during training. Our theory is supported by empirical results which demonstrate that the RNNs have improved robustness with respect to various input perturbations.

**Abstract:** Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great casualties and becomes almost the most urgent public health events worldwide. Computed tomography (CT) is a significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automated segmentation of lung infection in COVID-19 CT images will greatly assist diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections remains to be challenging. In this paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual attention mechanism to address the issues above. We introduce a dilated convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive field, which refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we present a dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are inserted to skip connection and model decoder respectively. The dual attention mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce semantic gap between different levels of the model. The proposed method has been evaluated on open-source dataset and outperforms cutting edges methods in semantic segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves a Dice score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified D2A U-Net without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other models trained from scratch, which still outperforms popular U-Net family models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626. Our experiment results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual attention mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which improves sensitivity to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant increase to Dice score.

**Abstract:** In recent years, storing large volumes of data on distributed devices has become commonplace. Applications involving sensors, for example, capture data in different modalities including image, video, audio, GPS and others. Novel algorithms are required to learn from this rich distributed data. In this paper, we present consensus based multi-layer perceptrons for resource-constrained devices. Assuming nodes (devices) in the distributed system are arranged in a graph and contain vertically partitioned data, the goal is to learn a global function that minimizes the loss. Each node learns a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron and obtains a loss on data stored locally. It then gossips with a neighbor, chosen uniformly at random, and exchanges information about the loss. The updated loss is used to run a back propagation algorithm and adjust weights appropriately. This method enables nodes to learn the global function without exchange of data in the network. Empirical results reveal that the consensus algorithm converges to the centralized model and has performance comparable to centralized multi-layer perceptrons and tree-based algorithms including random forests and gradient boosted decision trees.

<p>

**Abstract:** Brain tissue deformation resulting from head impacts is primarily caused by rotation and can lead to traumatic brain injury. To quantify brain injury risk based on measurements of kinematics on the head, finite element (FE) models and various brain injury criteria based on different factors of these kinematics have been developed, but the contribution of different kinematic factors has not been comprehensively analyzed across different types of head impacts in a data-driven manner. To better design brain injury criteria, the predictive power of rotational kinematics factors, which are different in 1) the derivative order (angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular jerk), 2) the direction and 3) the power (e.g., square-rooted, squared, cubic) of the angular velocity, were analyzed based on different datasets including laboratory impacts, American football, mixed martial arts (MMA), NHTSA automobile crashworthiness tests and NASCAR crash events. Ordinary least squares regressions were built from kinematics factors to the 95\% maximum principal strain (MPS95), and we compared zero-order correlation coefficients, structure coefficients, commonality analysis, and dominance analysis. The angular acceleration, the magnitude, and the first power factors showed the highest predictive power for the majority of impacts including laboratory impacts, American football impacts, with few exceptions (angular velocity for MMA and NASCAR impacts). The predictive power of rotational kinematics in three directions (x: posterior-to-anterior, y: left-to-right, z: superior-to-inferior) of kinematics varied with different sports and types of head impacts.

**Abstract:** We establish conditions under which gradient descent applied to fixed-width deep networks drives the logistic loss to zero, and prove bounds on the rate of convergence. Our analysis applies for smoothed approximations to the ReLU, such as Swish and the Huberized ReLU, proposed in previous applied work. We provide two sufficient conditions for convergence. The first is simply a bound on the loss at initialization. The second is a data separation condition used in prior analyses.

**Abstract:** In order to achieve high accuracy for machine learning (ML) applications, it is essential to employ models with a large number of parameters. Certain applications, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), however, require real-time interactions with users, hence compelling the model to have as low latency as possible. Deploying large scale ML applications thus necessitates model quantization and compression, especially when running ML models on resource constrained devices. For example, by forcing some of the model weight values into zero, it is possible to apply zero-weight compression, which reduces both the model size and model reading time from the memory. In the literature, such methods are referred to as sparse pruning. The fundamental questions are when and which weights should be forced to zero, i.e. be pruned. In this work, we propose a compressed sensing based pruning (CSP) approach to effectively address those questions. By reformulating sparse pruning as a sparsity inducing and compression-error reduction dual problem, we introduce the classic compressed sensing process into the ML model training process. Using ASR task as an example, we show that CSP consistently outperforms existing approaches in the literature.

**Abstract:** The automation of probabilistic reasoning is one of the primary aims of machine learning. Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data. These programs can be constructed automatically from an input probabilistic program and can also be amortized automatically. We evaluate the performance of the new variational programs in a series of structured inference problems. We find that cascading flows have much higher performance than both normalizing flows and ASVI in a large set of structured inference problems.

**Abstract:** Researches have demonstrated that low bit-width (e.g., INT8) quantization can be employed to accelerate the inference process. It makes the gradient quantization very promising since the backward propagation requires approximately twice more computation than forward one. Due to the variability and uncertainty of gradient distribution, a lot of methods have been proposed to attain training stability. However, most of them ignore the channel-wise gradient distributions and the impact of gradients with different magnitudes, resulting in the degradation of final accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel INT8 quantization training framework for convolutional neural network to address the above issues. Specifically, we adopt Gradient Vectorized Quantization to quantize the gradient, based on the observation that layer-wise gradients contain multiple distributions along the channel dimension. Then, Magnitude-aware Clipping Strategy is introduced by taking the magnitudes of gradients into consideration when minimizing the quantization error, and we present a theoretical derivation to solve the quantization parameters of different distributions. Experimental results on broad range of computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and video classification, demonstrate that the proposed Distribution Adaptive INT8 Quantization training method has achieved almost lossless training accuracy for different backbones, including ResNet, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG and AlexNet, which is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, we further implement the INT8 kernel that can accelerate the training iteration more than 200% under the latest Turing architecture, i.e., our method excels on both training accuracy and speed.

**Abstract:** Research has shown that trust is an essential aspect of human-computer interaction directly determining the degree to which the person is willing to use a system. An automatic prediction of the level of trust that a user has on a certain system could be used to attempt to correct potential distrust by having the system take relevant actions like, for example, apologizing or explaining its decisions. In this work, we explore the feasibility of automatically detecting the level of trust that a user has on a virtual assistant (VA) based on their speech. We developed a novel protocol for collecting speech data from subjects induced to have different degrees of trust in the skills of a VA. The protocol consists of an interactive session where the subject is asked to respond to a series of factual questions with the help of a virtual assistant. In order to induce subjects to either trust or distrust the VA's skills, they are first informed that the VA was previously rated by other users as being either good or bad; subsequently, the VA answers the subjects' questions consistently to its alleged abilities. All interactions are speech-based, with subjects and VAs communicating verbally, which allows the recording of speech produced under different trust conditions. Using this protocol, we collected a speech corpus in Argentine Spanish. We show clear evidence that the protocol effectively succeeded in influencing subjects into the desired mental state of either trusting or distrusting the agent's skills, and present results of a perceptual study of the degree of trust performed by expert listeners. Finally, we found that the subject's speech can be used to detect which type of VA they were using, which could be considered a proxy for the user's trust toward the VA's abilities, with an accuracy up to 76%, compared to a random baseline of 50%.

**Abstract:** Neural networks can be successfully used to improve several modules of advanced video coding schemes. In particular, compression of colour components was shown to greatly benefit from usage of machine learning models, thanks to the design of appropriate attention-based architectures that allow the prediction to exploit specific samples in the reference region. However, such architectures tend to be complex and computationally intense, and may be difficult to deploy in a practical video coding pipeline. This work focuses on reducing the complexity of such methodologies, to design a set of simplified and cost-effective attention-based architectures for chroma intra-prediction. A novel size-agnostic multi-model approach is proposed to reduce the complexity of the inference process. The resulting simplified architecture is still capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a collection of simplifications is presented in this paper, to further reduce the complexity overhead of the proposed prediction architecture. Thanks to these simplifications, a reduction in the number of parameters of around 90% is achieved with respect to the original attention-based methodologies. Simplifications include a framework for reducing the overhead of the convolutional operations, a simplified cross-component processing model integrated into the original architecture, and a methodology to perform integer-precision approximations with the aim to obtain fast and hardware-aware implementations. The proposed schemes are integrated into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) prediction pipeline, retaining compression efficiency of state-of-the-art chroma intra-prediction methods based on neural networks, while offering different directions for significantly reducing coding complexity.

**Abstract:** Our main contribution in this work is an empirical finding that random General Value Functions (GVFs), i.e., deep action-conditional predictions -- random both in what feature of observations they predict as well as in the sequence of actions the predictions are conditioned upon -- form good auxiliary tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) problems. In particular, we show that random deep action-conditional predictions when used as auxiliary tasks yield state representations that produce control performance competitive with state-of-the-art hand-crafted auxiliary tasks like value prediction, pixel control, and CURL in both Atari and DeepMind Lab tasks. In another set of experiments we stop the gradients from the RL part of the network to the state representation learning part of the network and show, perhaps surprisingly, that the auxiliary tasks alone are sufficient to learn state representations good enough to outperform an end-to-end trained actor-critic baseline. We opensourced our code at https://github.com/Hwhitetooth/random_gvfs.

**Abstract:** Code obfuscation aims at protecting Intellectual Property and other secrets embedded into software from being retrieved. Recent works leverage advances in artificial intelligence with the hope of getting blackbox deobfuscators completely immune to standard (whitebox) protection mechanisms. While promising, this new field of AI-based blackbox deobfuscation is still in its infancy. In this article we deepen the state of AI-based blackbox deobfuscation in three key directions: understand the current state-of-the-art, improve over it and design dedicated protection mechanisms. In particular, we define a novel generic framework for AI-based blackbox deobfuscation encompassing prior work and highlighting key components; we are the first to point out that the search space underlying code deobfuscation is too unstable for simulation-based methods (e.g., Monte Carlo Tres Search used in prior work) and advocate the use of robust methods such as S-metaheuritics; we propose the new optimized AI-based blackbox deobfuscator Xyntia which significantly outperforms prior work in terms of success rate (especially with small time budget) while being completely immune to the most recent anti-analysis code obfuscation methods; and finally we propose two novel protections against AI-based blackbox deobfuscation, allowing to counter Xyntia's powerful attacks.

**Abstract:** Inspired by the UNet architecture of semantic image segmentation, we propose a lightweight UNet using depthwise separable convolutions (DSUNet) for end-to-end learning of lane detection and path prediction (PP) in autonomous driving. We also design and integrate a PP algorithm with convolutional neural network (CNN) to form a simulation model (CNN-PP) that can be used to assess CNN's performance qualitatively, quantitatively, and dynamically in a host agent car driving along with other agents all in a real-time autonomous manner. DSUNet is 5.16x lighter in model size and 1.61x faster in inference than UNet. DSUNet-PP outperforms UNet-PP in mean average errors of predicted curvature and lateral offset for path planning in dynamic simulation. DSUNet-PP outperforms a modified UNet in lateral error, which is tested in a real car on real road. These results show that DSUNet is efficient and effective for lane detection and path prediction in autonomous driving.

**Abstract:** Many speech processing methods based on deep learning require an automatic and differentiable audio metric for the loss function. The DPAM approach of Manocha et al. learns a full-reference metric trained directly on human judgments, and thus correlates well with human perception. However, it requires a large number of human annotations and does not generalize well outside the range of perturbations on which it was trained. This paper introduces CDPAM, a metric that builds on and advances DPAM. The primary improvement is to combine contrastive learning and multi-dimensional representations to build robust models from limited data. In addition, we collect human judgments on triplet comparisons to improve generalization to a broader range of audio perturbations. CDPAM correlates well with human responses across nine varied datasets. We also show that adding this metric to existing speech synthesis and enhancement methods yields significant improvement, as measured by objective and subjective tests.

**Abstract:** Many real-world scenarios involve teams of agents that have to coordinate their actions to reach a shared goal. We focus on the setting in which a team of agents faces an opponent in a zero-sum, imperfect-information game. Team members can coordinate their strategies before the beginning of the game, but are unable to communicate during the playing phase of the game. This is the case, for example, in Bridge, collusion in poker, and collusion in bidding. In this setting, model-free RL methods are oftentimes unable to capture coordination because agents' policies are executed in a decentralized fashion. Our first contribution is a game-theoretic centralized training regimen to effectively perform trajectory sampling so as to foster team coordination. When team members can observe each other actions, we show that this approach provably yields equilibrium strategies. Then, we introduce a signaling-based framework to represent team coordinated strategies given a buffer of past experiences. Each team member's policy is parametrized as a neural network whose output is conditioned on a suitable exogenous signal, drawn from a learned probability distribution. By combining these two elements, we empirically show convergence to coordinated equilibria in cases where previous state-of-the-art multi-agent RL algorithms did not.

<p>

**Abstract:** How much credit (or blame) should an action taken in a state get for a future reward? This is the fundamental temporal credit assignment problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). One of the earliest and still most widely used heuristics is to assign this credit based on a scalar coefficient $Î»$ (treated as a hyperparameter) raised to the power of the time interval between the state-action and the reward. In this empirical paper, we explore heuristics based on more general pairwise weightings that are functions of the state in which the action was taken, the state at the time of the reward, as well as the time interval between the two. Of course it isn't clear what these pairwise weight functions should be, and because they are too complex to be treated as hyperparameters we develop a metagradient procedure for learning these weight functions during the usual RL training of a policy. Our empirical work shows that it is often possible to learn these pairwise weight functions during learning of the policy to achieve better performance than competing approaches.

**Abstract:** Design of new drug compounds with target properties is a key area of research in generative modeling. We present a small drug molecule design pipeline based on graph-generative models and a comparison study of two state-of-the-art graph generative models for designing COVID-19 targeted drug candidates: 1) a variational autoencoder-based approach (VAE) that uses prior knowledge of molecules that have been shown to be effective for earlier coronavirus treatments and 2) a deep Q-learning method (DQN) that generates optimized molecules without any proximity constraints. We evaluate the novelty of the automated molecule generation approaches by validating the candidate molecules with drug-protein binding affinity models. The VAE method produced two novel molecules with similar structures to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor Indinavir that show potential binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 protein target 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-protease).

<p>

**Abstract:** This paper addresses black-box optimization over multiple information sources whose both fidelity and query cost change over the search space, that is they are location dependent. The approach uses: (i) an Augmented Gaussian Process, recently proposed in multi-information source optimization as a single model of the objective function over search space and sources, and (ii) a Gaussian Process to model the location-dependent cost of each source. The former is used into a Confidence Bound based acquisition function to select the next source and location to query, while the latter is used to penalize the value of the acquisition depending on the expected query cost for any source-location pair. The proposed approach is evaluated on a set of Hyperparameters Optimization tasks, consisting of two Machine Learning classifiers and three datasets of different sizes.

**Abstract:** We study permutation invariant training (PIT), which targets at the permutation ambiguity problem for speaker independent source separation models. We extend two state-of-the-art PIT strategies. First, we look at the two-stage speaker separation and tracking algorithm based on frame level PIT (tPIT) and clustering, which was originally proposed for the STFT domain, and we adapt it to work with waveforms and over a learned latent space. Further, we propose an efficient clustering loss scalable to waveform models. Second, we extend a recently proposed auxiliary speaker-ID loss with a deep feature loss based on "problem agnostic speech features", to reduce the local permutation errors made by the utterance level PIT (uPIT). Our results show that the proposed extensions help reducing permutation ambiguity. However, we also note that the studied STFT-based models are more effective at reducing permutation errors than waveform-based models, a perspective overlooked in recent studies.

**Abstract:** Recent studies demonstrated the eligibility of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for solving the image registration problem. CNNs enable faster transformation estimation and greater generalization capability needed for better support during medical interventions. Conventional fully-supervised training requires a lot of high-quality ground truth data such as voxel-to-voxel transformations, which typically are attained in a too tedious and error-prone manner. In our work, we use weakly-supervised learning, which optimizes the model indirectly only via segmentation masks that are a more accessible ground truth than the deformation fields. Concerning the weak supervision, we investigate two segmentation similarity measures: multiscale Dice similarity coefficient (mDSC) and the similarity between segmentation-derived signed distance maps (SDMs). We show that the combination of mDSC and SDM similarity measures results in a more accurate and natural transformation pattern together with a stronger gradient coverage. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary input to the neural network for the prior information about the prostate location in the MR sequence, which mostly is available preoperatively. This approach significantly outperforms the standard two-input models. With weakly labelled MR-TRUS prostate data, we showed registration quality comparable to the state-of-the-art deep learning-based method.

**Abstract:** We address the problem of facial expression recognition and show a possible solution using a quantum machine learning approach. In order to define an efficient classifier for a given dataset, our approach substantially exploits quantum interference. By representing face expressions via graphs, we define a classifier as a quantum circuit that manipulates the graphs adjacency matrices encoded into the amplitudes of some appropriately defined quantum states. We discuss the accuracy of the quantum classifier evaluated on the quantum simulator available on the IBM Quantum Experience cloud platform, and compare it with the accuracy of one of the best classical classifier.

**Abstract:** As in almost every other branch of science, the major advances in data science and machine learning have also resulted in significant improvements regarding the modeling and simulation of nonlinear dynamical systems. It is nowadays possible to make accurate medium to long-term predictions of highly complex systems such as the weather, the dynamics within a nuclear fusion reactor, of disease models or the stock market in a very efficient manner. In many cases, predictive methods are advertised to ultimately be useful for control, as the control of high-dimensional nonlinear systems is an engineering grand challenge with huge potential in areas such as clean and efficient energy production, or the development of advanced medical devices. However, the question of how to use a predictive model for control is often left unanswered due to the associated challenges, namely a significantly higher system complexity, the requirement of much larger data sets and an increased and often problem-specific modeling effort. To solve these issues, we present a universal framework (which we call QuaSiModO: Quantization-Simulation-Modeling-Optimization) to transform arbitrary predictive models into control systems and use them for feedback control. The advantages of our approach are a linear increase in data requirements with respect to the control dimension, performance guarantees that rely exclusively on the accuracy of the predictive model, and only little prior knowledge requirements in control theory to solve complex control problems. In particular the latter point is of key importance to enable a large number of researchers and practitioners to exploit the ever increasing capabilities of predictive models for control in a straight-forward and systematic fashion.

**Abstract:** With increasing focus on privacy protection, alternative methods to identify vehicle operator without the use of biometric identifiers have gained traction for automotive data analysis. The wide variety of sensors installed on modern vehicles enable autonomous driving, reduce accidents and improve vehicle handling. On the other hand, the data these sensors collect reflect drivers' habit. Drivers' use of turn indicators, following distance, rate of acceleration, etc. can be transformed to an embedding that is representative of their behavior and identity. In this paper, we develop a deep learning architecture (Driver2vec) to map a short interval of driving data into an embedding space that represents the driver's behavior to assist in driver identification. We develop a custom model that leverages performance gains of temporal convolutional networks, embedding separation power of triplet loss and classification accuracy of gradient boosting decision trees. Trained on a dataset of 51 drivers provided by Nervtech, Driver2vec is able to accurately identify the driver from a short 10-second interval of sensor data, achieving an average pairwise driver identification accuracy of 83.1% from this 10-second interval, which is remarkably higher than performance obtained in previous studies. We then analyzed performance of Driver2vec to show that its performance is consistent across scenarios and that modeling choices are sound.

**Abstract:** Searching for relative mobile user interface (UI) design examples can aid interface designers in gaining inspiration and comparing design alternatives. However, finding such design examples is challenging, especially as current search systems rely on only text-based queries and do not consider the UI structure and content into account. This paper introduces VINS, a visual search framework, that takes as input a UI image (wireframe, high-fidelity) and retrieves visually similar design examples. We first survey interface designers to better understand their example finding process. We then develop a large-scale UI dataset that provides an accurate specification of the interface's view hierarchy (i.e., all the UI components and their specific location). By utilizing this dataset, we propose an object-detection based image retrieval framework that models the UI context and hierarchical structure. The framework achieves a mean Average Precision of 76.39\% for the UI detection and high performance in querying similar UI designs.

**Abstract:** Search-based test generation is guided by feedback from one or more fitness functions - scoring functions that judge solution optimality. Choosing informative fitness functions is crucial to meeting the goals of a tester. Unfortunately, many goals - such as forcing the class-under-test to throw exceptions, increasing test suite diversity, and attaining Strong Mutation Coverage - do not have effective fitness function formulations. We propose that meeting such goals requires treating fitness function identification as a secondary optimization step. An adaptive algorithm that can vary the selection of fitness functions could adjust its selection throughout the generation process to maximize goal attainment, based on the current population of test suites. To test this hypothesis, we have implemented two reinforcement learning algorithms in the EvoSuite unit test generation framework, and used these algorithms to dynamically set the fitness functions used during generation for the three goals identified above.
  We have evaluated our framework, EvoSuiteFIT, on a set of Java case examples. EvoSuiteFIT techniques attain significant improvements for two of the three goals, and show limited improvements on the third when the number of generations of evolution is fixed. Additionally, for two of the three goals, EvoSuiteFIT detects faults missed by the other techniques. The ability to adjust fitness functions allows strategic choices that efficiently produce more effective test suites, and examining these choices offers insight into how to attain our testing goals. We find that adaptive fitness function selection is a powerful technique to apply when an effective fitness function does not already exist for achieving a testing goal.

**Abstract:** The ability to distinguish between the self and the background is of paramount importance for robotic tasks. The particular case of hands, as the end effectors of a robotic system that more often enter into contact with other elements of the environment, must be perceived and tracked with precision to execute the intended tasks with dexterity and without colliding with obstacles. They are fundamental for several applications, from Human-Robot Interaction tasks to object manipulation. Modern humanoid robots are characterized by high number of degrees of freedom which makes their forward kinematics models very sensitive to uncertainty. Thus, resorting to vision sensing can be the only solution to endow these robots with a good perception of the self, being able to localize their body parts with precision. In this paper, we propose the use of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to segment the robot hand from an image in an egocentric view. It is known that CNNs require a huge amount of data to be trained. To overcome the challenge of labeling real-world images, we propose the use of simulated datasets exploiting domain randomization techniques. We fine-tuned the Mask-RCNN network for the specific task of segmenting the hand of the humanoid robot Vizzy. We focus our attention on developing a methodology that requires low amounts of data to achieve reasonable performance while giving detailed insight on how to properly generate variability in the training dataset. Moreover, we analyze the fine-tuning process within the complex model of Mask-RCNN, understanding which weights should be transferred to the new task of segmenting robot hands. Our final model was trained solely on synthetic images and achieves an average IoU of 82% on synthetic validation data and 56.3% on real test data. These results were achieved with only 1000 training images and 3 hours of training time using a single GPU.

**Abstract:** Despite advancements in deep reinforcement learning algorithms, developing an effective exploration strategy is still an open problem. Most existing exploration strategies either are based on simple heuristics, or require the model of the environment, or train additional deep neural networks to generate imagination-augmented paths. In this paper, a revolutionary algorithm, called Policy Augmentation, is introduced. Policy Augmentation is based on a newly developed inductive matrix completion method. The proposed algorithm augments the values of unexplored state-action pairs, helping the agent take actions that will result in high-value returns while the agent is in the early episodes. Training deep reinforcement learning algorithms with high-value rollouts leads to the faster convergence of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experiments show the superior performance of Policy Augmentation. The code can be found at: https://github.com/arashmahyari/PolicyAugmentation.

**Abstract:** Models for question answering, dialogue agents, and summarization often interpret the meaning of a sentence in a rich context and use that meaning in a new context. Taking excerpts of text can be problematic, as key pieces may not be explicit in a local window. We isolate and define the problem of sentence decontextualization: taking a sentence together with its context and rewriting it to be interpretable out of context, while preserving its meaning. We describe an annotation procedure, collect data on the Wikipedia corpus, and use the data to train models to automatically decontextualize sentences. We present preliminary studies that show the value of sentence decontextualization in a user facing task, and as preprocessing for systems that perform document understanding. We argue that decontextualization is an important subtask in many downstream applications, and that the definitions and resources provided can benefit tasks that operate on sentences that occur in a richer context.

Researchers have shown different methods to classify activities and their potential benefits by utilizing WiFi signals. In this paper, we analyze classification of moving objects by employing machine learning on real data from a massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) system in an indoor environment. We conduct measurements for different activities in both line-of-sight and non line-of-sight scenarios with a massive MIMO testbed operating at 3.7 GHz. We propose algorithms to exploit amplitude and phase-based features classification task. For the considered setup, we benchmark the classification performance and show that we can achieve up to 98% accuracy using real massive MIMO data, even with a small number of experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the gain in performance results with a massive MIMO system as compared with that of a limited number of antennas such as in WiFi devices.

**Abstract:** When solving a complex task, humans will spontaneously form teams and to complete different parts of the whole task, respectively. Meanwhile, the cooperation between teammates will improve efficiency. However, for current cooperative MARL methods, the cooperation team is constructed through either heuristics or end-to-end blackbox optimization. In order to improve the efficiency of cooperation and exploration, we propose a structured diversification emergence MARL framework named {\sc{Rochico}} based on reinforced organization control and hierarchical consensus learning. {\sc{Rochico}} first learns an adaptive grouping policy through the organization control module, which is established by independent multi-agent reinforcement learning. Further, the hierarchical consensus module based on the hierarchical intentions with consensus constraint is introduced after team formation. Simultaneously, utilizing the hierarchical consensus module and a self-supervised intrinsic reward enhanced decision module, the proposed cooperative MARL algorithm {\sc{Rochico}} can output the final diversified multi-agent cooperative policy. All three modules are organically combined to promote the structured diversification emergence. Comparative experiments on four large-scale cooperation tasks show that {\sc{Rochico}} is significantly better than the current SOTA algorithms in terms of exploration efficiency and cooperation strength.

**Abstract:** Representation learning for graphs enables the application of standard machine learning algorithms and data analysis tools to graph data. Replacing discrete unordered objects such as graph nodes by real-valued vectors is at the heart of many approaches to learning from graph data. Such vector representations, or embeddings, capture the discrete relationships in the original data by representing nodes as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
  In most applications graphs model the relationship between real-life objects and often nodes contain valuable meta-information about the original objects. While being a powerful machine learning tool, embeddings are not able to preserve such node attributes. We address this shortcoming and consider the problem of learning discrete node embeddings such that the coordinates of the node vector representations are graph nodes. This opens the door to designing interpretable machine learning algorithms for graphs as all attributes originally present in the nodes are preserved.
  We present a framework for coordinated local graph neighborhood sampling (COLOGNE) such that each node is represented by a fixed number of graph nodes, together with their attributes. Individual samples are coordinated and they preserve the similarity between node neighborhoods. We consider different notions of similarity for which we design scalable algorithms. We show theoretical results for all proposed algorithms. Experiments on benchmark graphs evaluate the quality of the designed embeddings and demonstrate how the proposed embeddings can be used in training interpretable machine learning algorithms for graph data.

**Abstract:** Training scene graph classification models requires a large amount of annotated image data. Meanwhile, scene graphs represent relational knowledge that can be modeled with symbolic data from texts or knowledge graphs. While image annotation demands extensive labor, collecting textual descriptions of natural scenes requires less effort. In this work, we investigate whether textual scene descriptions can substitute for annotated image data. To this end, we employ a scene graph classification framework that is trained not only from annotated images but also from symbolic data. In our architecture, the symbolic entities are first mapped to their correspondent image-grounded representations and then fed into the relational reasoning pipeline. Even though a structured form of knowledge, such as the form in knowledge graphs, is not always available, we can generate it from unstructured texts using a transformer-based language model. We show that by fine-tuning the classification pipeline with the extracted knowledge from texts, we can achieve ~8x more accurate results in scene graph classification, ~3x in object classification, and ~1.5x in predicate classification, compared to the supervised baselines with only 1% of the annotated images.

**Abstract:** Designing proper loss functions for vision tasks has been a long-standing research direction to advance the capability of existing models. For object detection, the well-established classification and regression loss functions have been carefully designed by considering diverse learning challenges. Inspired by the recent progress in network architecture search, it is interesting to explore the possibility of discovering new loss function formulations via directly searching the primitive operation combinations. So that the learned losses not only fit for diverse object detection challenges to alleviate huge human efforts, but also have better alignment with evaluation metric and good mathematical convergence property. Beyond the previous auto-loss works on face recognition and image classification, our work makes the first attempt to discover new loss functions for the challenging object detection from primitive operation levels. We propose an effective convergence-simulation driven evolutionary search algorithm, called CSE-Autoloss, for speeding up the search progress by regularizing the mathematical rationality of loss candidates via convergence property verification and model optimization simulation. CSE-Autoloss involves the search space that cover a wide range of the possible variants of existing losses and discovers best-searched loss function combination within a short time (around 1.5 wall-clock days). We conduct extensive evaluations of loss function search on popular detectors and validate the good generalization capability of searched losses across diverse architectures and datasets. Our experiments show that the best-discovered loss function combinations outperform default combinations by 1.1% and 0.8% in terms of mAP for two-stage and one-stage detectors on COCO respectively. Our searched losses are available at https://github.com/PerdonLiu/CSE-Autoloss.

**Abstract:** Anomaly and outlier detection is a long-standing problem in machine learning. In some cases, anomaly detection is easy, such as when data are drawn from well-characterized distributions such as the Gaussian. However, when data occupy high-dimensional spaces, anomaly detection becomes more difficult. We present CLAM (Clustered Learning of Approximate Manifolds), a manifold mapping technique in any metric space. CLAM begins with a fast hierarchical clustering technique and then induces a graph from the cluster tree, based on overlapping clusters as selected using several geometric and topological features. Using these graphs, we implement CHAODA (Clustered Hierarchical Anomaly and Outlier Detection Algorithms), exploring various properties of the graphs and their constituent clusters to find outliers. CHAODA employs a form of transfer learning based on a training set of datasets, and applies this knowledge to a separate test set of datasets of different cardinalities, dimensionalities, and domains. On 24 publicly available datasets, we compare CHAODA (by measure of ROC AUC) to a variety of state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly-detection algorithms. Six of the datasets are used for training. CHAODA outperforms other approaches on 16 of the remaining 18 datasets. CLAM and CHAODA scale to large, high-dimensional "big data" anomaly-detection problems, and generalize across datasets and distance functions. Source code to CLAM and CHAODA are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/URI-ABD/clam.

**Abstract:** Domain-aware machine learning (ML) models have been increasingly adopted for accelerating small molecule therapeutic design in the recent years. These models have been enabled by significant advancement in state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and computing infrastructures. Several ML architectures are pre-dominantly and independently used either for predicting the properties of small molecules, or for generating lead therapeutic candidates. Synergetically using these individual components along with robust representation and data generation techniques autonomously in closed loops holds enormous promise for accelerated drug design which is a time consuming and expensive task otherwise. In this perspective, we present the most recent breakthrough achieved by each of the components, and how such autonomous AI and ML workflow can be realized to radically accelerate the hit identification and lead optimization. Taken together, this could significantly shorten the timeline for end-to-end antiviral discovery and optimization times to weeks upon the arrival of a novel zoonotic transmission event. Our perspective serves as a guide for researchers to practice autonomous molecular design in therapeutic discovery.

**Abstract:** Value-based methods of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially the value decomposition methods, have been demonstrated on a range of challenging cooperative tasks. However, current methods pay little attention to the interaction between agents, which is essential to teamwork in games or real life. This limits the efficiency of value-based MARL algorithms in the two aspects: collaborative exploration and value function estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative MARL algorithm named as interactive actor-critic~(IAC), which models the interaction of agents from the perspectives of policy and value function. On the policy side, a multi-agent joint stochastic policy is introduced by adopting a collaborative exploration module, which is trained by maximizing the entropy-regularized expected return. On the value side, we use the shared attention mechanism to estimate the value function of each agent, which takes the impact of the teammates into consideration. At the implementation level, we extend the value decomposition methods to continuous control tasks and evaluate IAC on benchmark tasks including classic control and multi-agent particle environments. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and achieves better performance in terms of cooperation.

**Abstract:** In recent years, reinforcement learning has seen interest because of deep Q-Learning, where the model is a convolutional neural network. Deep Q-Learning has shown promising results in games such as Atari and AlphaGo. Instead of learning the entire Q-table, it learns an estimate of the Q function that determines a state's policy action. We use Q-Learning and deep Q-learning, to learn control policies of four constraint satisfaction games (15-Puzzle, Minesweeper, 2048, and Sudoku). 15-Puzzle is a sliding permutation puzzle and provides a challenge in addressing its large state space. Minesweeper and Sudoku involve partially observable states and guessing. 2048 is also a sliding puzzle but allows for easier state representation (compared to 15-Puzzle) and uses interesting reward shaping to solve the game. These games offer unique insights into the potential and limits of reinforcement learning. The Q agent is trained with no rules of the game, with only the reward corresponding to each state's action. Our unique contribution is in choosing the reward structure, state representation, and formulation of the deep neural network. For low shuffle, 15-Puzzle, achieves a 100% win rate, the medium and high shuffle achieve about 43% and 22% win rates respectively. On a standard 16x16 Minesweeper board, both low and high-density boards achieve close to 45% win rate, whereas medium density boards have a low win rate of 15%. For 2048, the 1024 win rate was achieved with significant ease (100%) with high win rates for 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384 as 40%, 0.05%, 0.01% and 0.004% , respectively. The easy Sudoku games had a win rate of 7%, while medium and hard games had 2.1% and 1.2% win rates, respectively. This paper explores the environment complexity and behavior of a subset of constraint games using reward structures which can get us closer to understanding how humans learn.

**Abstract:** Conventional Supervised Learning approaches focus on the mapping from input features to output labels. After training, the learnt models alone are adapted onto testing features to predict testing labels in isolation, with training data wasted and their associations ignored. To take full advantage of the vast number of training data and their associations, we propose a novel learning paradigm called Memory-Associated Differential (MAD) Learning. We first introduce an additional component called Memory to memorize all the training data. Then we learn the differences of labels as well as the associations of features in the combination of a differential equation and some sampling methods. Finally, in the evaluating phase, we predict unknown labels by inferencing from the memorized facts plus the learnt differences and associations in a geometrically meaningful manner. We gently build this theory in unary situations and apply it on Image Recognition, then extend it into Link Prediction as a binary situation, in which our method outperforms strong state-of-the-art baselines on ogbl-ddi dataset.

**Abstract:** The transduction of sequence has been mostly done by recurrent networks, which are computationally demanding and often underestimate uncertainty severely. We propose a computationally efficient attention-based network combined with the Gaussian process regression to generate real-valued sequence, which we call the Attentive-GP. The proposed model not only improves the training efficiency by dispensing recurrence and convolutions but also learns the factorized generative distribution with Bayesian representation. However, the presence of the GP precludes the commonly used mini-batch approach to the training of the attention network. Therefore, we develop a block-wise training algorithm to allow mini-batch training of the network while the GP is trained using full-batch, resulting in a scalable training method. The algorithm has been proved to converge and shows comparable, if not better, quality of the found solution. As the algorithm does not assume any specific network architecture, it can be used with a wide range of hybrid models such as neural networks with kernel machine layers in the scarcity of resources for computation and memory.

**Abstract:** The outbreak of COVID-19 Disease due to the novel coronavirus has caused a shortage of medical resources. To aid and accelerate the diagnosis process, automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 via deep learning models has recently been explored by researchers across the world. While different data-driven deep learning models have been developed to mitigate the diagnosis of COVID-19, the data itself is still scarce due to patient privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a natural solution because it allows different organizations to cooperatively learn an effective deep learning model without sharing raw data. However, recent studies show that FL still lacks privacy protection and may cause data leakage. We investigate this challenging problem by proposing a simple yet effective algorithm, named \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning \textbf{o}n Medical Datasets using \textbf{P}artial Networks (FLOP), that shares only a partial model between the server and clients. Extensive experiments on benchmark data and real-world healthcare tasks show that our approach achieves comparable or better performance while reducing the privacy and security risks. Of particular interest, we conduct experiments on the COVID-19 dataset and find that our FLOP algorithm can allow different hospitals to collaboratively and effectively train a partially shared model without sharing local patients' data.

**Abstract:** Exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning and control. In this work, we study task-guided exploration and determine what precisely an agent must learn about their environment in order to complete a particular task. Formally, we study a broad class of decision-making problems in the setting of linear dynamical systems, a class that includes the linear quadratic regulator problem. We provide instance- and task-dependent lower bounds which explicitly quantify the difficulty of completing a task of interest. Motivated by our lower bound, we propose a computationally efficient experiment-design based exploration algorithm. We show that it optimally explores the environment, collecting precisely the information needed to complete the task, and provide finite-time bounds guaranteeing that it achieves the instance- and task-optimal sample complexity, up to constant factors. Through several examples of the LQR problem, we show that performing task-guided exploration provably improves on exploration schemes which do not take into account the task of interest. Along the way, we establish that certainty equivalence decision making is instance- and task-optimal, and obtain the first algorithm for the linear quadratic regulator problem which is instance-optimal. We conclude with several experiments illustrating the effectiveness of our approach in practice.

**Abstract:** Fine-grained estimation of galaxy merger stages from observations is a key problem useful for validation of our current theoretical understanding of galaxy formation. To this end, we demonstrate a CNN-based regression model that is able to predict, for the first time, using a single image, the merger stage relative to the first perigee passage with a median error of 38.3 million years (Myrs) over a period of 400 Myrs. This model uses no specific dynamical modeling and learns only from simulated merger events. We show that our model provides reasonable estimates on real observations, approximately matching prior estimates provided by detailed dynamical modeling. We provide a preliminary interpretability analysis of our models, and demonstrate first steps toward calibrated uncertainty estimation.

**Abstract:** MetaDL Challenge 2020 focused on image classification tasks in few-shot settings. This paper describes second best submission in the competition. Our meta learning approach modifies the distribution of classes in a latent space produced by a backbone network for each class in order to better follow the Gaussian distribution. After this operation which we call Latent Space Transform algorithm, centers of classes are further aligned in an iterative fashion of the Expectation Maximisation algorithm to utilize information in unlabeled data that are often provided on top of few labelled instances. For this task, we utilize optimal transport mapping using the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms previous works as well as other variants of the algorithm, using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, Gaussian Mixture Models, etc.

**Abstract:** Training modern neural networks is an inherently noisy process that can lead to high \emph{prediction churn} -- disagreements between re-trainings of the same model due to factors such as randomization in the parameter initialization and mini-batches -- even when the trained models all attain similar accuracies. Such prediction churn can be very undesirable in practice. In this paper, we present several baselines for reducing churn and show that training on soft labels obtained by adaptively smoothing each example's label based on the example's neighboring labels often outperforms the baselines on churn while improving accuracy on a variety of benchmark classification tasks and model architectures.

**Abstract:** Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is critical in many applications. We propose an unsupervised method to detect OOD samples using a $k$-NN density estimate with respect to a classification model's intermediate activations on in-distribution samples. We leverage a recent insight about label smoothing, which we call the \emph{Label Smoothed Embedding Hypothesis}, and show that one of the implications is that the $k$-NN density estimator performs better as an OOD detection method both theoretically and empirically when the model is trained with label smoothing. Finally, we show that our proposal outperforms many OOD baselines and also provide new finite-sample high-probability statistical results for $k$-NN density estimation's ability to detect OOD examples.

**Abstract:** We present an ensemble prediction system using a Deep Learning Weather Prediction (DLWP) model that recursively predicts key atmospheric variables with six-hour time resolution. This model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a cubed sphere grid to produce global forecasts. The approach is computationally efficient, requiring just three minutes on a single GPU to produce a 320-member set of six-week forecasts at 1.4Â° resolution. Ensemble spread is primarily produced by randomizing the CNN training process to create a set of 32 DLWP models with slightly different learned weights. Although our DLWP model does not forecast precipitation, it does forecast total column water vapor, and it gives a reasonable 4.5-day deterministic forecast of Hurricane Irma. In addition to simulating mid-latitude weather systems, it spontaneously generates tropical cyclones in a one-year free-running simulation. Averaged globally and over a two-year test set, the ensemble mean RMSE retains skill relative to climatology beyond two-weeks, with anomaly correlation coefficients remaining above 0.6 through six days. Our primary application is to subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting at lead times from two to six weeks. Current forecast systems have low skill in predicting one- or 2-week-average weather patterns at S2S time scales. The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) and the ranked probability skill score (RPSS) show that the DLWP ensemble is only modestly inferior in performance to the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S ensemble over land at lead times of 4 and 5-6 weeks. At shorter lead times, the ECMWF ensemble performs better than DLWP.

The proposed approach provides a principled way to gain explicit control over the continuous style space. We demonstrate the efficiency of the technique on popular facial emotion benchmarks, achieving low reconstruction cost and high emotion classification accuracy.

We then prove several equivalence results between MAIDs and EFGs. Finally, we describe an open source implementation for reasoning about MAIDs and computing their equilibria.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a simple unsupervised visual representation learning method with a pretext task of discriminating all images in a dataset using a parametric, instance-level classifier. The overall framework is a replica of a supervised classification model, where semantic classes (e.g., dog, bird, and ship) are replaced by instance IDs. However, scaling up the classification task from thousands of semantic labels to millions of instance labels brings specific challenges including 1) the large-scale softmax computation; 2) the slow convergence due to the infrequent visiting of instance samples; and 3) the massive number of negative classes that can be noisy. This work presents several novel techniques to handle these difficulties. First, we introduce a hybrid parallel training framework to make large-scale training feasible. Second, we present a raw-feature initialization mechanism for classification weights, which we assume offers a contrastive prior for instance discrimination and can clearly speed up converge in our experiments. Finally, we propose to smooth the labels of a few hardest classes to avoid optimizing over very similar negative pairs. While being conceptually simple, our framework achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, i.e., SimCLR, MoCoV2, and PIC under ImageNet linear evaluation protocol and on several downstream visual tasks, verifying that full instance classification is a strong pretraining technique for many semantic visual tasks.

**Abstract:** The goal of this paper to generate a visually appealing video that responds to music with a neural network so that each frame of the video reflects the musical characteristics of the corresponding audio clip. To achieve the goal, we propose a neural music visualizer directly mapping deep music embeddings to style embeddings of StyleGAN, named TrÃ¤umerAI, which consists of a music auto-tagging model using short-chunk CNN and StyleGAN2 pre-trained on WikiArt dataset. Rather than establishing an objective metric between musical and visual semantics, we manually labeled the pairs in a subjective manner. An annotator listened to 100 music clips of 10 seconds long and selected an image that suits the music among the 200 StyleGAN-generated examples. Based on the collected data, we trained a simple transfer function that converts an audio embedding to a style embedding. The generated examples show that the mapping between audio and video makes a certain level of intra-segment similarity and inter-segment dissimilarity.

**Abstract:** Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their potential in federated learning, i.e., learning a centralized model from data privately hosted by multiple sites. A federatedGAN jointly trains a centralized generator and multiple private discriminators hosted at different sites. A major theoretical challenge for the federated GAN is the heterogeneity of the local data distributions. Traditional approaches cannot guarantee to learn the target distribution, which isa mixture of the highly different local distributions. This paper tackles this theoretical challenge, and for the first time, provides a provably correct framework for federated GAN. We propose a new approach called Universal Aggregation, which simulates a centralized discriminator via carefully aggregating the mixture of all private discriminators. We prove that a generator trained with this simulated centralized discriminator can learn the desired target distribution. Through synthetic and real datasets, we show that our method can learn the mixture of largely different distributions where existing federated GAN methods fail.

In particular, Machine Learning algorithms with sequences as inputs have seen successfull applications to important problems, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech signal modeling. The usage this class of models in collider physics leverages their ability to act on data with variable sequence lengths, such as constituents inside a jet. In this document, we explore the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and other sequence-based neural network architectures to classify jets, regress jet-related quantities and to build a physics-inspired jet representation, in connection to jet clustering algorithms. In addition, alternatives to sequential data representations are briefly discussed.

**Abstract:** Statistical machine learning models trained with stochastic gradient algorithms are increasingly being deployed in critical scientific applications. However, computing the stochastic gradient in several such applications is highly expensive or even impossible at times. In such cases, derivative-free or zeroth-order algorithms are used. An important question which has thus far not been addressed sufficiently in the statistical machine learning literature is that of equipping stochastic zeroth-order algorithms with practical yet rigorous inferential capabilities so that we not only have point estimates or predictions but also quantify the associated uncertainty via confidence intervals or sets. Towards this, in this work, we first establish a central limit theorem for Polyak-Ruppert averaged stochastic zeroth-order gradient algorithm. We then provide online estimators of the asymptotic covariance matrix appearing in the central limit theorem, thereby providing a practical procedure for constructing asymptotically valid confidence sets (or intervals) for parameter estimation (or prediction) in the zeroth-order setting.

**Abstract:** In representation learning, there has been recent interest in developing algorithms to disentangle the ground-truth generative factors behind a dataset, and metrics to quantify how fully this occurs. However, these algorithms and metrics often assume that both representations and ground-truth factors are flat, continuous, and factorized, whereas many real-world generative processes involve rich hierarchical structure, mixtures of discrete and continuous variables with dependence between them, and even varying intrinsic dimensionality. In this work, we develop benchmarks, algorithms, and metrics for learning such hierarchical representations.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of learning stabilizer states with noise in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework of Aaronson (2007) for learning quantum states. In the noiseless setting, an algorithm for this problem was recently given by Rocchetto (2018), but the noisy case was left open. Motivated by approaches to noise tolerance from classical learning theory, we introduce the Statistical Query (SQ) model for PAC-learning quantum states, and prove that algorithms in this model are indeed resilient to common forms of noise, including classification and depolarizing noise. We prove an exponential lower bound on learning stabilizer states in the SQ model. Even outside the SQ model, we prove that learning stabilizer states with noise is in general as hard as Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) using classical examples. Our results position the problem of learning stabilizer states as a natural quantum analogue of the classical problem of learning parities: easy in the noiseless setting, but seemingly intractable even with simple forms of noise.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of nonstochastic bandits with expert advice, extending the setting from finitely many experts to any countably infinite set: A learner aims to maximize the total reward by taking actions sequentially based on bandit feedback while benchmarking against a set of experts. We propose a variant of Exp4.P that, for finitely many experts, enables inference of correct expert rankings while preserving the order of the regret upper bound. We then incorporate the variant into a meta-algorithm that works on infinitely many experts. We prove a high-probability upper bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \big( i^*K + \sqrt{KT} \big)$ on the regret, up to polylog factors, where $i^*$ is the unknown position of the best expert, $K$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is the time horizon. We also provide an example of structured experts and discuss how to expedite learning in such case. Our meta-learning algorithm achieves optimal regret up to polylog factors when $i^* = \tilde{\mathcal{O}} \big( \sqrt{T/K} \big)$. If a prior distribution is assumed to exist for $i^*$, the probability of optimality increases with $T$, the rate of which can be fast.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation is an inexpensive way to increase training data diversity and is commonly achieved via transformations of existing data. For tasks such as classification, there is a good case for learning representations of the data that are invariant to such transformations, yet this is not explicitly enforced by classification losses such as the cross-entropy loss. This paper investigates the use of training objectives that explicitly impose this consistency constraint and how it can impact downstream audio classification tasks. In the context of deep convolutional neural networks in the supervised setting, we show empirically that certain measures of consistency are not implicitly captured by the cross-entropy loss and that incorporating such measures into the loss function can improve the performance of audio classification systems. Put another way, we demonstrate how existing augmentation methods can further improve learning by enforcing consistency.

**Abstract:** We investigate different methods for regularizing quantile regression when predicting either a subset of quantiles or the full inverse CDF. We show that minimizing an expected pinball loss over a continuous distribution of quantiles is a good regularizer even when only predicting a specific quantile. For predicting multiple quantiles, we propose achieving the classic goal of non-crossing quantiles by using deep lattice networks that treat the quantile as a monotonic input feature, and we discuss why monotonicity on other features is an apt regularizer for quantile regression. We show that lattice models enable regularizing the predicted distribution to a location-scale family. Lastly, we propose applying rate constraints to improve the calibration of the quantile predictions on specific subsets of interest and improve fairness metrics. We demonstrate our contributions on simulations, benchmark datasets, and real quantile regression problems.

**Abstract:** Back-door attack poses a severe threat to deep learning systems. It injects hidden malicious behaviors to a model such that any input stamped with a special pattern can trigger such behaviors. Detecting back-door is hence of pressing need. Many existing defense techniques use optimization to generate the smallest input pattern that forces the model to misclassify a set of benign inputs injected with the pattern to a target label. However, the complexity is quadratic to the number of class labels such that they can hardly handle models with many classes. Inspired by Multi-Arm Bandit in Reinforcement Learning, we propose a K-Arm optimization method for backdoor detection. By iteratively and stochastically selecting the most promising labels for optimization with the guidance of an objective function, we substantially reduce the complexity, allowing to handle models with many classes. Moreover, by iteratively refining the selection of labels to optimize, it substantially mitigates the uncertainty in choosing the right labels, improving detection accuracy. At the time of submission, the evaluation of our method on over 4000 models in the IARPA TrojAI competition from round 1 to the latest round 4 achieves top performance on the leaderboard. Our technique also supersedes three state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and the scanning time needed.

**Abstract:** Enabling fully autonomous robots capable of navigating and exploring large-scale, unknown and complex environments has been at the core of robotics research for several decades. A key requirement in autonomous exploration is building accurate and consistent maps of the unknown environment that can be used for reliable navigation. Loop closure detection, the ability to assert that a robot has returned to a previously visited location, is crucial for consistent mapping as it reduces the drift caused by error accumulation in the estimated robot trajectory. Moreover, in multi-robot systems, loop closures enable merging local maps obtained by a team of robots into a consistent global map of the environment. In this paper, we present a degeneracy-aware and drift-resilient loop closing method to improve place recognition and resolve 3D location ambiguities for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in GPS-denied, large-scale and perceptually-degraded environments. More specifically, we focus on SLAM in subterranean environments (e.g., lava tubes, caves, and mines) that represent examples of complex and ambiguous environments where current methods have inadequate performance.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models are now widely deployed in real-world applications. However, the existence of adversarial examples has been long considered a real threat to such models. While numerous defenses aiming to improve the robustness have been proposed, many have been shown ineffective. As these vulnerabilities are still nowhere near being eliminated, we propose an alternative deployment-based defense paradigm that goes beyond the traditional white-box and black-box threat models. Instead of training a single partially-robust model, one could train a set of same-functionality, yet, adversarially-disjoint models with minimal in-between attack transferability. These models could then be randomly and individually deployed, such that accessing one of them minimally affects the others. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and a wide range of attacks show that we achieve a significantly lower attack transferability across our disjoint models compared to a baseline of ensemble diversity. In addition, compared to an adversarially trained set, we achieve a higher average robust accuracy while maintaining the accuracy of clean examples.

**Abstract:** Methods for processing point cloud information have seen a great success in collider physics applications. One recent breakthrough in machine learning is the usage of Transformer networks to learn semantic relationships between sequences in language processing. In this work, we apply a modified Transformer network called Point Cloud Transformer as a method to incorporate the advantages of the Transformer architecture to an unordered set of particles resulting from collision events. To compare the performance with other strategies, we study jet-tagging applications for highly-boosted particles.

**Abstract:** The explosive growth of easily-accessible unlabeled data has lead to growing interest in active learning, a paradigm in which data-hungry learning algorithms adaptively select informative examples in order to lower prohibitively expensive labeling costs. Unfortunately, in standard worst-case models of learning, the active setting often provides no improvement over non-adaptive algorithms. To combat this, a series of recent works have considered a model in which the learner may ask enriched queries beyond labels. While such models have seen success in drastically lowering label costs, they tend to come at the expense of requiring large amounts of memory. In this work, we study what families of classifiers can be learned in bounded memory. To this end, we introduce a novel streaming-variant of enriched-query active learning along with a natural combinatorial parameter called lossless sample compression that is sufficient for learning not only with bounded memory, but in a query-optimal and computationally efficient manner as well. Finally, we give three fundamental examples of classifier families with small, easy to compute lossless compression schemes when given access to basic enriched queries: axis-aligned rectangles, decision trees, and halfspaces in two dimensions.

**Abstract:** There is a growing desire to create computer systems that can communicate effectively to collaborate with humans on complex, open-ended activities. Assessing these systems presents significant challenges. We describe a framework for evaluating systems engaged in open-ended complex scenarios where evaluators do not have the luxury of comparing performance to a single right answer. This framework has been used to evaluate human-machine creative collaborations across story and music generation, interactive block building, and exploration of molecular mechanisms in cancer. These activities are fundamentally different from the more constrained tasks performed by most contemporary personal assistants as they are generally open-ended, with no single correct solution, and often no obvious completion criteria.
  We identified the Key Properties that must be exhibited by successful systems. From there we identified "Hallmarks" of success -- capabilities and features that evaluators can observe that would be indicative of progress toward achieving a Key Property. In addition to being a framework for assessment, the Key Properties and Hallmarks are intended to serve as goals in guiding research direction.

**Abstract:** "No-till" and cover cropping are often identified as the leading simple, best management practices for carbon sequestration in agriculture. However, the root of the problem is more complex, with the potential benefits of these approaches depending on numerous factors including a field's soil type(s), topography, and management history. Instead of using computer vision approaches to simply classify a field a still vs. no-till, we instead seek to identify the degree of residue coverage across afield through a probabilistic deep learning segmentation approach to enable more accurate analysis of carbon holding potential and realization. This approach will not only provide more precise insights into currently implemented practices, but also enable a more accurate identification process of fields with the greatest potential for adopting new practices to significantly impact carbon sequestration in agriculture.

**Abstract:** In the era of big data, the utilization of credit-scoring models to determine the credit risk of applicants accurately becomes a trend in the future. The conventional machine learning on credit scoring data sets tends to have poor classification for the minority class, which may bring huge commercial harm to banks. In order to classify imbalanced data sets, we propose a new ensemble algorithm, namely, Weighted-Hybrid-Sampling-Boost (WHSBoost). In data sampling, we process the imbalanced data sets with weights by the Weighted-SMOTE method and the Weighted-Under-Sampling method, and thus obtain a balanced training sample data set with equal weight. In ensemble algorithm, each time we train the base classifier, the balanced data set is given by the method above. In order to verify the applicability and robustness of the WHSBoost algorithm, we performed experiments on the simulation data sets, real benchmark data sets and real credit scoring data sets, comparing WHSBoost with SMOTE, SMOTEBoost and HSBoost based on SVM, BPNN, DT and KNN.

**Abstract:** Finding efficient, easily implementable differentially private (DP) algorithms that offer strong excess risk bounds is an important problem in modern machine learning. To date, most work has focused on private empirical risk minimization (ERM) or private population loss minimization. However, there are often other objectives--such as fairness, adversarial robustness, or sensitivity to outliers--besides average performance that are not captured in the classical ERM setup. To this end, we study a completely general family of convex, Lipschitz loss functions and establish the first known DP excess risk and runtime bounds for optimizing this broad class. We provide similar bounds under additional assumptions of smoothness and/or strong convexity. We also address private stochastic convex optimization (SCO). While $(Îµ, Î´)$-DP ($Î´> 0$) has been the focus of much recent work in private SCO, proving tight population loss bounds and runtime bounds for $(Îµ, 0)$-DP remains a challenging open problem. We provide the tightest known $(Îµ, 0)$-DP population loss bounds and fastest runtimes under the presence of (or lack of) smoothness and strong convexity. Our methods extend to the $Î´> 0$ setting, where we offer the unique benefit of ensuring differential privacy for arbitrary $Îµ> 0$ by incorporating a new form of Gaussian noise. Finally, we apply our theory to two learning frameworks: tilted ERM and adversarial learning. In particular, our theory quantifies tradeoffs between adversarial robustness, privacy, and runtime. Our results are achieved using perhaps the simplest DP algorithm: output perturbation. Although this method is not novel conceptually, our novel implementation scheme and analysis show that the power of this method to achieve strong privacy, utility, and runtime guarantees has not been fully appreciated in prior works.

**Abstract:** Clinical practice in intensive care units (ICUs) requires early warnings when a patient's condition is about to deteriorate so that preventive measures can be undertaken. To this end, prediction algorithms have been developed that estimate the risk of mortality in ICUs. In this work, we propose a novel generative deep probabilistic model for real-time risk scoring in ICUs. Specifically, we develop an attentive deep Markov model called AttDMM. To the best of our knowledge, AttDMM is the first ICU prediction model that jointly learns both long-term disease dynamics (via attention) and different disease states in health trajectory (via a latent variable model). Our evaluations were based on an established baseline dataset (MIMIC-III) with 53,423 ICU stays. The results confirm that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our AttDMM was superior: AttDMM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.876, which yielded an improvement over the state-of-the-art method by 2.2%. In addition, the risk score from the AttDMM provided warnings several hours earlier. Thereby, our model shows a path towards identifying patients at risk so that health practitioners can intervene early and save patient lives.

**Abstract:** Although the lower layers of a deep neural network learn features which are transferable across datasets, these layers are not transferable within the same dataset. That is, in general, freezing the trained feature extractor (the lower layers) and retraining the classifier (the upper layers) on the same dataset leads to worse performance. In this paper, for the first time, we show that the frozen classifier is transferable within the same dataset. We develop a novel top-down training method which can be viewed as an algorithm for searching for high-quality classifiers. We tested this method on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks and language modelling tasks. The proposed method consistently improves recurrent neural network ASR models on Wall Street Journal, self-attention ASR models on Switchboard, and AWD-LSTM language models on WikiText-2.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new technique that applies automated image analysis in the area of structural corrosion monitoring and demonstrate improved efficacy compared to existing approaches. Structural corrosion monitoring is the initial step of the risk-based maintenance philosophy and depends on an engineer's assessment regarding the risk of building failure balanced against the fiscal cost of maintenance. This introduces the opportunity for human error which is further complicated when restricted to assessment using drone captured images for those areas not reachable by humans due to many background noises. The importance of this problem has promoted an active research community aiming to support the engineer through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) image analysis for corrosion detection. In this paper, we advance this area of research with the development of a framework, CorrDetector. CorrDetector uses a novel ensemble deep learning approach underpinned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for structural identification and corrosion feature extraction. We provide an empirical evaluation using real-world images of a complicated structure (e.g. telecommunication tower) captured by drones, a typical scenario for engineers. Our study demonstrates that the ensemble approach of \model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of classification accuracy.

**Abstract:** Koopman spectral analysis has attracted attention for nonlinear dynamical systems since we can analyze nonlinear dynamics with a linear regime by embedding data into a Koopman space by a nonlinear function. For the analysis, we need to find appropriate embedding functions. Although several neural network-based methods have been proposed for learning embedding functions, existing methods require long time-series for training neural networks. This limitation prohibits performing Koopman spectral analysis in applications where only short time-series are available. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for estimating embedding functions from unseen short time-series by exploiting knowledge learned from related but different time-series. With the proposed method, a representation of a given short time-series is obtained by a bidirectional LSTM for extracting its properties. The embedding function of the short time-series is modeled by a neural network that depends on the time-series representation. By sharing the LSTM and neural networks across multiple time-series, we can learn common knowledge from different time-series while modeling time-series-specific embedding functions with the time-series representation. Our model is trained such that the expected test prediction error is minimized with the episodic training framework. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of eigenvalue estimation and future prediction than existing methods.

**Abstract:** Stochastic bilevel optimization generalizes the classic stochastic optimization from the minimization of a single objective to the minimization of an objective function that depends the solution of another optimization problem. Recently, stochastic bilevel optimization is regaining popularity in emerging machine learning applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and model-agnostic meta learning. To solve this class of stochastic optimization problems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates, which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve an $Îµ$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\cal O}(Îµ^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $Îµ$-optimal solution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\cal O}(Îµ^{-1})$ samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bilevel optimization algorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as the stochastic gradient descent method for the single-level stochastic optimization.

**Abstract:** Most computer science conferences rely on paper bidding to assign reviewers to papers. Although paper bidding enables high-quality assignments in days of unprecedented submission numbers, it also opens the door for dishonest reviewers to adversarially influence paper reviewing assignments. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some reviewers bid on papers by "friends" or colluding authors, even though these papers are outside their area of expertise, and recommend them for acceptance without considering the merit of the work. In this paper, we study the efficacy of such bid manipulation attacks and find that, indeed, they can jeopardize the integrity of the review process. We develop a novel approach for paper bidding and assignment that is much more robust against such attacks. We show empirically that our approach provides robustness even when dishonest reviewers collude, have full knowledge of the assignment system's internal workings, and have access to the system's inputs. In addition to being more robust, the quality of our paper review assignments is comparable to that of current, non-robust assignment approaches.

**Abstract:** We review various characterizations of uniform convexity and smoothness on norm balls in finite-dimensional spaces and connect results stemming from the geometry of Banach spaces with \textit{scaling inequalities} used in analysing the convergence of optimization methods. In particular, we establish local versions of these conditions to provide sharper insights on a recent body of complexity results in learning theory, online learning, or offline optimization, which rely on the strong convexity of the feasible set. While they have a significant impact on complexity, these strong convexity or uniform convexity properties of feasible sets are not exploited as thoroughly as their functional counterparts, and this work is an effort to correct this imbalance. We conclude with some practical examples in optimization and machine learning where leveraging these conditions and localized assumptions lead to new complexity results.

**Abstract:** Inertial particles advected by a background flow can show complex structures. We consider inertial particles in a 2D Taylor-Green (TG) flow and characterize particle dynamics as a function of the particle's Stokes number using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method from particle image velocimetry (PIV) like-data. We observe the formation of caustic structures and analyze them using DMD to (a) determine the Stokes number of the particles, and (b) estimate the particle Stokes number composition. Our analysis in this idealized flow will provide useful insight to analyze inertial particles in more complex or turbulent flows. We propose that the DMD technique can be used to perform a similar analysis on an experimental system.

**Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) holds great promise in transforming healthcare. While published studies have shown the utility of ML models in interpreting medical imaging examinations, these are often evaluated under laboratory settings. The importance of real world evaluation is best illustrated by case studies that have documented successes and failures in the translation of these models into clinical environments. A key prerequisite for the clinical adoption of these technologies is demonstrating generalizable ML model performance under real world circumstances. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that ML model generalizability is achievable in medical imaging with the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans serving as the use case. An ML model was trained using 21,784 scans from the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage CT dataset while generalizability was evaluated using an external validation dataset obtained from our busy trauma and neurosurgical center. This real world external validation dataset consisted of every unenhanced head CT scan (n = 5,965) performed in our emergency department in 2019 without exclusion. The model demonstrated an AUC of 98.4%, sensitivity of 98.8%, and specificity of 98.0%, on the test dataset. On external validation, the model demonstrated an AUC of 95.4%, sensitivity of 91.3%, and specificity of 94.1%. Evaluating the ML model using a real world external validation dataset that is temporally and geographically distinct from the training dataset indicates that ML generalizability is achievable in medical imaging applications.

**Abstract:** The Information bottleneck (IB) method enables optimizing over the trade-off between compression of data and prediction accuracy of learned representations, and has successfully and robustly been applied to both supervised and unsupervised representation learning problems. However, IB has several limitations. First, the IB problem is hard to optimize. The IB Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{IB}:=I(X;Z)-Î²I(Y;Z)$ is non-convex and existing solutions guarantee only local convergence. As a result, the obtained solutions depend on initialization. Second, the evaluation of a solution is also a challenging task. Conventionally, it resorts to characterizing the information plane, that is, plotting $I(Y;Z)$ versus $I(X;Z)$ for all solutions obtained from different initial points. Furthermore, the IB Lagrangian has phase transitions while varying the multiplier $Î²$. At phase transitions, both $I(X;Z)$ and $I(Y;Z)$ increase abruptly and the rate of convergence becomes significantly slow for existing solutions. Recent works with IB adopt variational surrogate bounds to the IB Lagrangian. Although allowing efficient optimization, how close are these surrogates to the IB Lagrangian is not clear. In this work, we solve the IB Lagrangian using augmented Lagrangian methods. With augmented variables, we show that the IB objective can be solved with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Different from prior works, we prove that the proposed algorithm is consistently convergent, regardless of the value of $Î²$. Empirically, our gradient-descent-based method results in information plane points that are comparable to those obtained through the conventional Blahut-Arimoto-based solvers and is convergent for a wider range of the penalty coefficient than previous ADMM solvers.

**Abstract:** The increased adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents an opportunity to solve many socio-economic and environmental challenges; however, this cannot happen without securing AI-enabled technologies. In recent years, most AI models are vulnerable to advanced and sophisticated hacking techniques. This challenge has motivated concerted research efforts into adversarial AI, with the aim of developing robust machine and deep learning models that are resilient to different types of adversarial scenarios. In this paper, we present a holistic cyber security review that demonstrates adversarial attacks against AI applications, including aspects such as adversarial knowledge and capabilities, as well as existing methods for generating adversarial examples and existing cyber defence models. We explain mathematical AI models, especially new variants of reinforcement and federated learning, to demonstrate how attack vectors would exploit vulnerabilities of AI models. We also propose a systematic framework for demonstrating attack techniques against AI applications and reviewed several cyber defences that would protect AI applications against those attacks. We also highlight the importance of understanding the adversarial goals and their capabilities, especially the recent attacks against industry applications, to develop adaptive defences that assess to secure AI applications. Finally, we describe the main challenges and future research directions in the domain of security and privacy of AI technologies.

**Abstract:** Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search has attracted more and more attentions due to its online search advantages. Numbers of methods studying the enhancement of speed and recall have been put forward. However, few of them focus on the efficiency and scale of offline graph-construction. For a deployed visual search system with several billions of online images in total, building a billion-scale offline graph in hours is essential, which is almost unachievable by most existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Binary Distributed Graph to solve this problem. Specifically, we combine binary codes with graph structure to speedup online and offline procedures, and achieve comparable performance with the ones in real-value based scenarios by recalling more binary candidates. Furthermore, the graph-construction is optimized to completely distributed implementation, which significantly accelerates the offline process and gets rid of the limitation of memory and disk within a single machine. Experimental comparisons on Alibaba Commodity Data Set (more than three billion images) show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art with respect to the online/offline trade-off.

**Abstract:** The gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm has been widely applied to solve minimax optimization problems. In order to achieve convergent policy parameters for minimax optimization, it is important that GDA generates convergent variable sequences rather than convergent sequences of function values or gradient norms. However, the variable convergence of GDA has been proved only under convexity geometries, and there lacks understanding for general nonconvex minimax optimization. This paper fills such a gap by studying the convergence of a more general proximal-GDA for regularized nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization. Specifically, we show that proximal-GDA admits a novel Lyapunov function, which monotonically decreases in the minimax optimization process and drives the variable sequence to a critical point. By leveraging this Lyapunov function and the KÅ geometry that parameterizes the local geometries of general nonconvex functions, we formally establish the variable convergence of proximal-GDA to a critical point $x^*$, i.e., $x_t\to x^*, y_t\to y^*(x^*)$. Furthermore, over the full spectrum of the KÅ-parameterized geometry, we show that proximal-GDA achieves different types of convergence rates ranging from sublinear convergence up to finite-step convergence, depending on the geometry associated with the KÅ parameter. This is the first theoretical result on the variable convergence for nonconvex minimax optimization.

**Abstract:** This short technical report describes the approach submitted to the Clinical BCI Challenge-WCCI2020. This submission aims to classify motor imagery task from EEG signals and relies on Riemannian Geometry, with a twist. Instead of using the classical covariance matrices, we also rely on measures of functional connectivity. Our approach ranked 1st on the task 1 of the competition.

**Abstract:** We design a simple reinforcement learning (RL) agent that implements an optimistic version of $Q$-learning and establish through regret analysis that this agent can operate with some level of competence in any environment. While we leverage concepts from the literature on provably efficient RL, we consider a general agent-environment interface and provide a novel agent design and analysis. This level of generality positions our results to inform the design of future agents for operation in complex real environments. We establish that, as time progresses, our agent performs competitively relative to policies that require longer times to evaluate. The time it takes to approach asymptotic performance is polynomial in the complexity of the agent's state representation and the time required to evaluate the best policy that the agent can represent. Notably, there is no dependence on the complexity of the environment. The ultimate per-period performance loss of the agent is bounded by a constant multiple of a measure of distortion introduced by the agent's state representation. This work is the first to establish that an algorithm approaches this asymptotic condition within a tractable time frame.

**Abstract:** Attention-based pre-trained language models such as GPT-2 brought considerable progress to end-to-end dialogue modelling. However, they also present considerable risks for task-oriented dialogue, such as lack of knowledge grounding or diversity. To address these issues, we introduce modified training objectives for language model finetuning, and we employ massive data augmentation via back-translation to increase the diversity of the training data. We further examine the possibilities of combining data from multiples sources to improve performance on the target dataset. We carefully evaluate our contributions with both human and automatic methods. Our model substantially outperforms the baseline on the MultiWOZ data and shows competitive performance with state of the art in both automatic and human evaluation.

**Abstract:** We empirically demonstrate that test-time adaptive batch normalization, which re-estimates the batch-normalization statistics during inference, can provide $\ell_2$-certification as well as improve the commonly occurring corruption robustness of adversarially trained models while maintaining their state-of-the-art empirical robustness against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we obtain similar $\ell_2$-certification as the current state-of-the-art certification models for CIFAR-10 by learning our adversarially trained model using larger $\ell_2$-bounded adversaries. Therefore our work is a step towards bridging the gap between the state-of-the-art certification and empirical robustness. Our results also indicate that improving the empirical adversarial robustness may be sufficient as we achieve certification and corruption robustness as a by-product using test-time adaptive batch normalization.

**Abstract:** Overfit is a fundamental problem in machine learning in general, and in deep learning in particular. In order to reduce overfit and improve generalization in the classification of images, some employ invariance to a group of transformations, such as rotations and reflections. However, since not all objects exhibit necessarily the same invariance, it seems desirable to allow the network to learn the useful level of invariance from the data. To this end, motivated by self-supervision, we introduce an architecture enhancement for existing neural network models based on input transformations, termed 'TransNet', together with a training algorithm suitable for it. Our model can be employed during training time only and then pruned for prediction, resulting in an equivalent architecture to the base model. Thus pruned, we show that our model improves performance on various data-sets while exhibiting improved generalization, which is achieved in turn by enforcing soft invariance on the convolutional kernels of the last layer in the base model. Theoretical analysis is provided to support the proposed method.

**Abstract:** We present a SNN simulator which scales to millions of neurons, billions of synapses, and 8 GPUs. This is made possible by 1) a novel, cache-aware spike transmission algorithm 2) a model parallel multi-GPU distribution scheme and 3) a static, yet very effective load balancing strategy. The simulator further features an easy to use API and the ability to create custom models. We compare the proposed simulator against two state of the art ones on a series of benchmarks using three well-established models. We find that our simulator is faster, consumes less memory, and scales linearly with the number of GPUs.
