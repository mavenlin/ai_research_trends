**Abstract:** Machine learning applications frequently come with multiple diverse objectives and constraints that can change over time. Accordingly, trained models can be tuned with sets of hyper-parameters that affect their predictive behavior (e.g., their run-time efficiency versus error rate). As the number of constraints and hyper-parameter dimensions grow, naively selected settings may lead to sub-optimal and/or unreliable results. We develop an efficient method for calibrating models such that their predictions provably satisfy multiple explicit and simultaneous statistical guarantees (e.g., upper-bounded error rates), while also optimizing any number of additional, unconstrained objectives (e.g., total run-time cost). Building on recent results in distribution-free, finite-sample risk control for general losses, we propose Pareto Testing: a two-stage process which combines multi-objective optimization with multiple hypothesis testing. The optimization stage constructs a set of promising combinations on the Pareto frontier. We then apply statistical testing to this frontier only to identify configurations that have (i) high utility with respect to our objectives, and (ii) guaranteed risk levels with respect to our constraints, with specifiable high probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to reliably accelerate the execution of large-scale Transformer models in natural language processing (NLP) applications. In particular, we show how Pareto Testing can be used to dynamically configure multiple inter-dependent model attributes -- including the number of layers computed before exiting, number of attention heads pruned, or number of text tokens considered -- to simultaneously control and optimize various accuracy and cost metrics.

**Abstract:** Hand, the bearer of human productivity and intelligence, is receiving much attention due to the recent fever of digital twins. Among different hand morphable models, MANO has been widely used in vision and graphics community. However, MANO disregards textures and accessories, which largely limits its power to synthesize photorealistic hand data. In this paper, we extend MANO with Diverse Accessories and Rich Textures, namely DART. DART is composed of 50 daily 3D accessories which varies in appearance and shape, and 325 hand-crafted 2D texture maps covers different kinds of blemishes or make-ups. Unity GUI is also provided to generate synthetic hand data with user-defined settings, e.g., pose, camera, background, lighting, textures, and accessories. Finally, we release DARTset, which contains large-scale (800K), high-fidelity synthetic hand images, paired with perfect-aligned 3D labels. Experiments demonstrate its superiority in diversity. As a complement to existing hand datasets, DARTset boosts the generalization in both hand pose estimation and mesh recovery tasks. Raw ingredients (textures, accessories), Unity GUI, source code and DARTset are publicly available at dart2022.github.io

**Abstract:** Recent work has seen the development of general purpose neural architectures that can be trained to perform tasks across diverse data modalities. General purpose models typically make few assumptions about the underlying data-structure and are known to perform well in the large-data regime. At the same time, there has been growing interest in modular neural architectures that represent the data using sparsely interacting modules. These models can be more robust out-of-distribution, computationally efficient, and capable of sample-efficient adaptation to new data. However, they tend to make domain-specific assumptions about the data, and present challenges in how module behavior (i.e., parameterization) and connectivity (i.e., their layout) can be jointly learned. In this work, we introduce a general purpose, yet modular neural architecture called Neural Attentive Circuits (NACs) that jointly learns the parameterization and a sparse connectivity of neural modules without using domain knowledge. NACs are best understood as the combination of two systems that are jointly trained end-to-end: one that determines the module configuration and the other that executes it on an input. We demonstrate qualitatively that NACs learn diverse and meaningful module configurations on the NLVR2 dataset without additional supervision. Quantitatively, we show that by incorporating modularity in this way, NACs improve upon a strong non-modular baseline in terms of low-shot adaptation on CIFAR and CUBs dataset by about 10%, and OOD robustness on Tiny ImageNet-R by about 2.5%. Further, we find that NACs can achieve an 8x speedup at inference time while losing less than 3% performance. Finally, we find NACs to yield competitive results on diverse data modalities spanning point-cloud classification, symbolic processing and text-classification from ASCII bytes, thereby confirming its general purpose nature.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in classical machine learning have shown that creating models with inductive biases encoding the symmetries of a problem can greatly improve performance. Importation of these ideas, combined with an existing rich body of work at the nexus of quantum theory and symmetry, has given rise to the field of Geometric Quantum Machine Learning (GQML). Following the success of its classical counterpart, it is reasonable to expect that GQML will play a crucial role in developing problem-specific and quantum-aware models capable of achieving a computational advantage. Despite the simplicity of the main idea of GQML -- create architectures respecting the symmetries of the data -- its practical implementation requires a significant amount of knowledge of group representation theory. We present an introduction to representation theory tools from the optics of quantum learning, driven by key examples involving discrete and continuous groups. These examples are sewn together by an exposition outlining the formal capture of GQML symmetries via "label invariance under the action of a group representation", a brief (but rigorous) tour through finite and compact Lie group representation theory, a reexamination of ubiquitous tools like Haar integration and twirling, and an overview of some successful strategies for detecting symmetries.

**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) has demonstrated promising results on identifying efficient Transformer architectures which outperform manually designed ones for natural language tasks like neural machine translation (NMT). Existing NAS methods operate on a space of dense architectures, where all of the sub-architecture weights are activated for every input. Motivated by the recent advances in sparsely activated models like the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, we introduce sparse architectures with conditional computation into the NAS search space. Given this expressive search space which subsumes prior densely activated architectures, we develop a new framework AutoMoE to search for efficient sparsely activated sub-Transformers. AutoMoE-generated sparse models obtain (i) 3x FLOPs reduction over manually designed dense Transformers and (ii) 23% FLOPs reduction over state-of-the-art NAS-generated dense sub-Transformers with parity in BLEU score on benchmark datasets for NMT. AutoMoE consists of three training phases: (a) Heterogeneous search space design with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?); (b) SuperNet training that jointly trains several subnetworks sampled from the large search space by weight-sharing; (c) Evolutionary search for the architecture with the optimal trade-off between task performance and computational constraint like FLOPs and latency. AutoMoE code, data and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/AutoMoE.

**Abstract:** Imitation learning from human-provided demonstrations is a strong approach for learning policies for robot manipulation. While the ideal dataset for imitation learning is homogenous and low-variance -- reflecting a single, optimal method for performing a task -- natural human behavior has a great deal of heterogeneity, with several optimal ways to demonstrate a task. This multimodality is inconsequential to human users, with task variations manifesting as subconscious choices; for example, reaching down, then across to grasp an object, versus reaching across, then down. Yet, this mismatch presents a problem for interactive imitation learning, where sequences of users improve on a policy by iteratively collecting new, possibly conflicting demonstrations. To combat this problem of demonstrator incompatibility, this work designs an approach for 1) measuring the compatibility of a new demonstration given a base policy, and 2) actively eliciting more compatible demonstrations from new users. Across two simulation tasks requiring long-horizon, dexterous manipulation and a real-world "food plating" task with a Franka Emika Panda arm, we show that we can both identify incompatible demonstrations via post-hoc filtering, and apply our compatibility measure to actively elicit compatible demonstrations from new users, leading to improved task success rates across simulated and real environments.

**Abstract:** Image segmentation is an important task in medical imaging. It constitutes the backbone of a wide variety of clinical diagnostic methods, treatments, and computer-aided surgeries. In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel image segmentation net (MKIS-Net), which uses multiple kernels to create an efficient receptive field and enhance segmentation performance. As a result of its multi-kernel design, MKIS-Net is a light-weight architecture with a small number of trainable parameters. Moreover, these multi-kernel receptive fields also contribute to better segmentation results. We demonstrate the efficacy of MKIS-Net on several tasks including segmentation of retinal vessels, skin lesion segmentation, and chest X-ray segmentation. The performance of the proposed network is quite competitive, and often superior, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, in some cases MKIS-Net has more than an order of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than existing medical image segmentation alternatives and is at least four times smaller than other light-weight architectures.

**Abstract:** An accurate model of the environment and the dynamic agents acting in it offers great potential for improving motion planning. We present MILE: a Model-based Imitation LEarning approach to jointly learn a model of the world and a policy for autonomous driving. Our method leverages 3D geometry as an inductive bias and learns a highly compact latent space directly from high-resolution videos of expert demonstrations. Our model is trained on an offline corpus of urban driving data, without any online interaction with the environment. MILE improves upon prior state-of-the-art by 35% in driving score on the CARLA simulator when deployed in a completely new town and new weather conditions. Our model can predict diverse and plausible states and actions, that can be interpretably decoded to bird's-eye view semantic segmentation. Further, we demonstrate that it can execute complex driving manoeuvres from plans entirely predicted in imagination. Our approach is the first camera-only method that models static scene, dynamic scene, and ego-behaviour in an urban driving environment. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/wayveai/mile.

**Abstract:** Multi-task learning based video anomaly detection methods combine multiple proxy tasks in different branches to detect video anomalies in different situations. Most existing methods either do not combine complementary tasks to effectively cover all motion patterns, or the class of the objects is not explicitly considered. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we propose a novel multi-task learning based method that combines complementary proxy tasks to better consider the motion and appearance features. We combine the semantic segmentation and future frame prediction tasks in a single branch to learn the object class and consistent motion patterns, and to detect respective anomalies simultaneously. In the second branch, we added several attention mechanisms to detect motion anomalies with attention to object parts, the direction of motion, and the distance of the objects from the camera. Our qualitative results show that the proposed method considers the object class effectively and learns motion with attention to the aforementioned important factors which results in a precise motion modeling and a better motion anomaly detection. Additionally, quantitative results show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial to the development of generative systems. In recent years, pre-trained language model (PLM) based metrics, such as BERTScore, have been commonly adopted in various generation tasks. However, it has been demonstrated that PLMs encode a range of stereotypical societal biases, leading to a concern on the fairness of PLMs as metrics. To that end, this work presents the first systematic study on the social bias in PLM-based metrics. We demonstrate that popular PLM-based metrics exhibit significantly higher social bias than traditional metrics on 6 sensitive attributes, namely race, gender, religion, physical appearance, age, and socioeconomic status. In-depth analysis suggests that choosing paradigms (matching, regression, or generation) of the metric has a greater impact on fairness than choosing PLMs. In addition, we develop debiasing adapters that are injected into PLM layers, mitigating bias in PLM-based metrics while retaining high performance for evaluating text generation.

**Abstract:** Face recognition is a popular form of biometric authentication and due to its widespread use, attacks have become more common as well. Recent studies show that Face Recognition Systems are vulnerable to attacks and can lead to erroneous identification of faces. Interestingly, most of these attacks are white-box, or they are manipulating facial images in ways that are not physically realizable. In this paper, we propose an attack scheme where the attacker can generate realistic synthesized face images with subtle perturbations and physically realize that onto his face to attack black-box face recognition systems. Comprehensive experiments and analyses show that subtle perturbations realized on attackers face can create successful attacks on state-of-the-art face recognition systems in black-box settings. Our study exposes the underlying vulnerability posed by the Face Recognition Systems against realizable black-box attacks.

**Abstract:** The recently proposed capability-based NLP testing allows model developers to test the functional capabilities of NLP models, revealing functional failures that cannot be detected by the traditional heldout mechanism. However, existing work on capability-based testing requires extensive manual efforts and domain expertise in creating the test cases. In this paper, we investigate a low-cost approach for the test case generation by leveraging the GPT-3 engine. We further propose to use a classifier to remove the invalid outputs from GPT-3 and expand the outputs into templates to generate more test cases. Our experiments show that TestAug has three advantages over the existing work on behavioral testing: (1) TestAug can find more bugs than existing work; (2) The test cases in TestAug are more diverse; and (3) TestAug largely saves the manual efforts in creating the test suites. The code and data for TestAug can be found at our project website (https://guanqun-yang.github.io/testaug/) and GitHub (https://github.com/guanqun-yang/testaug).

**Abstract:** Recent years have seen embodied visual navigation advance in two distinct directions: (i) in equipping the AI agent to follow natural language instructions, and (ii) in making the navigable world multimodal, e.g., audio-visual navigation. However, the real world is not only multimodal, but also often complex, and thus in spite of these advances, agents still need to understand the uncertainty in their actions and seek instructions to navigate. To this end, we present AVLEN~ -- an interactive agent for Audio-Visual-Language Embodied Navigation. Similar to audio-visual navigation tasks, the goal of our embodied agent is to localize an audio event via navigating the 3D visual world; however, the agent may also seek help from a human (oracle), where the assistance is provided in free-form natural language. To realize these abilities, AVLEN uses a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning backbone that learns: (a) high-level policies to choose either audio-cues for navigation or to query the oracle, and (b) lower-level policies to select navigation actions based on its audio-visual and language inputs. The policies are trained via rewarding for the success on the navigation task while minimizing the number of queries to the oracle. To empirically evaluate AVLEN, we present experiments on the SoundSpaces framework for semantic audio-visual navigation tasks. Our results show that equipping the agent to ask for help leads to a clear improvement in performance, especially in challenging cases, e.g., when the sound is unheard during training or in the presence of distractor sounds.

**Abstract:** Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning have considerably advanced Computational Literary Studies. Similarly, the construction of co-occurrence networks of literary characters, and their analysis using methods from social network analysis and network science, have provided insights into the micro- and macro-level structure of literary texts. Combining these perspectives, in this work we study character networks extracted from a text corpus of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. We show that this perspective helps us to analyse and visualise the narrative style that characterises Tolkien's works. Addressing character classification, embedding and co-occurrence prediction, we further investigate the advantages of state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks over a popular word embedding method. Our results highlight the large potential of graph learning in Computational Literary Studies.

**Abstract:** Traditional machine learning techniques have been widely used to establish the trust management systems. However, the scale of training dataset can significantly affect the security performances of the systems, while it is a great challenge to detect malicious nodes due to the absence of labeled data regarding novel attacks. To address this issue, this paper presents a generative adversarial network (GAN) based trust management mechanism for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs). First, type-2 fuzzy logic is adopted to evaluate the reputation of sensor nodes while alleviating the uncertainty problem. Then, trust vectors are collected to train a GAN-based codec structure, which is used for further malicious node detection. Moreover, to avoid normal nodes being isolated from the network permanently due to error detections, a GAN-based trust redemption model is constructed to enhance the resilience of trust management. Based on the latest detection results, a trust model update method is developed to adapt to the dynamic industrial environment. The proposed trust management mechanism is finally applied to secure clustering for reliable and real-time data transmission, and simulation results show that it achieves a high detection rate up to 96%, as well as a low false positive rate below 8%.

**Abstract:** Melanoma is regarded as the most threatening among all skin cancers. There is a pressing need to build systems which can aid in the early detection of melanoma and enable timely treatment to patients. Recent methods are geared towards machine learning based systems where the task is posed as image recognition, tag dermoscopic images of skin lesions as melanoma or non-melanoma. Even though these methods show promising results in terms of accuracy, they are computationally quite expensive to train, that questions the ability of these models to be deployable in a clinical setting or memory constraint devices. To address this issue, we focus on building simple and performant models having few layers, less than ten compared to hundreds. As well as with fewer learnable parameters, 0.26 million (M) compared to 42.5M using knowledge distillation with the goal to detect melanoma from dermoscopic images. First, we train a teacher model using a ResNet-50 to detect melanoma. Using the teacher model, we train the student model known as Distilled Student Network (DSNet) which has around 0.26M parameters using knowledge distillation achieving an accuracy of 91.7%. We compare against ImageNet pre-trained models such MobileNet, VGG-16, Inception-V3, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101. We find that our approach works well in terms of inference runtime compared to other pre-trained models, 2.57 seconds compared to 14.55 seconds. We find that DSNet (0.26M parameters), which is 15 times smaller, consistently performs better than EfficientNet-B0 (4M parameters) in both melanoma and non-melanoma detection across Precision, Recall and F1 scores

<p>

**Abstract:** We introduce MOVE, a novel method to segment objects without any form of supervision. MOVE exploits the fact that foreground objects can be shifted locally relative to their initial position and result in realistic (undistorted) new images. This property allows us to train a segmentation model on a dataset of images without annotation and to achieve state of the art (SotA) performance on several evaluation datasets for unsupervised salient object detection and segmentation. In unsupervised single object discovery, MOVE gives an average CorLoc improvement of 7.2% over the SotA, and in unsupervised class-agnostic object detection it gives a relative AP improvement of 53% on average. Our approach is built on top of self-supervised features (e.g. from DINO or MAE), an inpainting network (based on the Masked AutoEncoder) and adversarial training.

**Abstract:** As Gaussian processes mature, they are increasingly being deployed as part of larger machine learning and decision-making systems, for instance in geospatial modeling, Bayesian optimization, or in latent Gaussian models. Within a system, the Gaussian process model needs to perform in a stable and reliable manner to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts the system. In this work, we study the numerical stability of scalable sparse approximations based on inducing points. We derive sufficient and in certain cases necessary conditions on the inducing points for the computations performed to be numerically stable. For low-dimensional tasks such as geospatial modeling, we propose an automated method for computing inducing points satisfying these conditions. This is done via a modification of the cover tree data structure, which is of independent interest. We additionally propose an alternative sparse approximation for regression with a Gaussian likelihood which trades off a small amount of performance to further improve stability. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a number of examples, showing that, in geospatial settings, sparse approximations with guaranteed numerical stability often perform comparably to those without.

**Abstract:** The success of supervised deep learning models in medical image segmentation relies on detailed annotations. However, labor-intensive manual labeling is costly and inefficient, especially in dense object segmentation. To this end, we propose a self-supervised learning based approach with a Prior Self-activation Module (PSM) that generates self-activation maps from the input images to avoid labeling costs and further produce pseudo masks for the downstream task. To be specific, we firstly train a neural network using self-supervised learning and utilize the gradient information in the shallow layers of the network to generate self-activation maps. Afterwards, a semantic-guided generator is then introduced as a pipeline to transform visual representations from PSM to pixel-level semantic pseudo masks for downstream tasks. Furthermore, a two-stage training module, consisting of a nuclei detection network and a nuclei segmentation network, is adopted to achieve the final segmentation. Experimental results show the effectiveness on two public pathological datasets. Compared with other fully-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, our method can achieve competitive performance without any manual annotations.

**Abstract:** Lifelong learning (LL) is vital for advanced task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems. To address the catastrophic forgetting issue of LL, generative replay methods are widely employed to consolidate past knowledge with generated pseudo samples. However, most existing generative replay methods use only a single task-specific token to control their models. This scheme is usually not strong enough to constrain the generative model due to insufficient information involved. In this paper, we propose a novel method, prompt conditioned VAE for lifelong learning (PCLL), to enhance generative replay by incorporating tasks' statistics. PCLL captures task-specific distributions with a conditional variational autoencoder, conditioned on natural language prompts to guide the pseudo-sample generation. Moreover, it leverages a distillation process to further consolidate past knowledge by alleviating the noise in pseudo samples. Experiments on natural language understanding tasks of ToD systems demonstrate that PCLL significantly outperforms competitive baselines in building LL models.

**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have proven to be a crucial component of modern natural language processing systems. PLMs typically need to be fine-tuned on task-specific downstream datasets, which makes it hard to claim the ownership of PLMs and protect the developer's intellectual property due to the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. We show that PLMs can be watermarked with a multi-task learning framework by embedding backdoors triggered by specific inputs defined by the owners, and those watermarks are hard to remove even though the watermarked PLMs are fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks. In addition to using some rare words as triggers, we also show that the combination of common words can be used as backdoor triggers to avoid them being easily detected. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the embedded watermarks can be robustly extracted with a high success rate and less influenced by the follow-up fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** The discrete Fourier transform is among the most routine tools used in high-resolution scanning / transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). However, when calculating a Fourier transform, periodic boundary conditions are imposed and sharp discontinuities between the edges of an image cause a cross patterned artifact along the reciprocal space axes. This artifact can interfere with the analysis of reciprocal lattice peaks of an atomic resolution image. Here we demonstrate that the recently developed Periodic Plus Smooth Decomposition technique provides a simple, efficient method for reliable removal of artifacts caused by edge discontinuities. In this method, edge artifacts are reduced by subtracting a smooth background that solves Poisson's equation with boundary conditions set by the image's edges. Unlike the traditional windowed Fourier transforms, Periodic Plus Smooth Decomposition maintains sharp reciprocal lattice peaks from the image's entire field of view.

**Abstract:** This paper provides an exact characterization of the expected generalization error (gen-error) for semi-supervised learning (SSL) with pseudo-labeling via the Gibbs algorithm. This characterization is expressed in terms of the symmetrized KL information between the output hypothesis, the pseudo-labeled dataset, and the labeled dataset. It can be applied to obtain distribution-free upper and lower bounds on the gen-error. Our findings offer new insights that the generalization performance of SSL with pseudo-labeling is affected not only by the information between the output hypothesis and input training data but also by the information {\em shared} between the {\em labeled} and {\em pseudo-labeled} data samples. To deepen our understanding, we further explore two examples -- mean estimation and logistic regression. In particular, we analyze how the ratio of the number of unlabeled to labeled data $Œª$ affects the gen-error under both scenarios. As $Œª$ increases, the gen-error for mean estimation decreases and then saturates at a value larger than when all the samples are labeled, and the gap can be quantified {\em exactly} with our analysis, and is dependent on the \emph{cross-covariance} between the labeled and pseudo-labeled data sample. In logistic regression, the gen-error and the variance component of the excess risk also decrease as $Œª$ increases.

**Abstract:** Generative flow networks (GFNs) are a class of models for sequential sampling of composite objects, which approximate a target distribution that is defined in terms of an energy function or a reward. GFNs are typically trained using a flow matching or trajectory balance objective, which matches forward and backward transition models over trajectories. In this work, we define variational objectives for GFNs in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between the forward and backward distribution. We show that variational inference in GFNs is equivalent to minimizing the trajectory balance objective when sampling trajectories from the forward model. We generalize this approach by optimizing a convex combination of the reverse- and forward KL divergence. This insight suggests variational inference methods can serve as a means to define a more general family of objectives for training generative flow networks, for example by incorporating control variates, which are commonly used in variational inference, to reduce the variance of the gradients of the trajectory balance objective. We evaluate our findings and the performance of the proposed variational objective numerically by comparing it to the trajectory balance objective on two synthetic tasks.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive results in a range of vision-language tasks. However, popular VLMs usually consist of hundreds of millions of parameters which brings challenges for fine-tuning and deployment in real-world applications due to space, memory, and latency constraints. In this work, we introduce a distilling then pruning framework to compress large vision-language models into smaller, faster, and more accurate ones. We first shrink the size of a pre-trained large VLM and apply knowledge distillation in the vision-language pre-training stage to obtain a task-agnostic compact VLM. Then we propose a modal-adaptive pruning algorithm to automatically infer the importance of vision and language modalities for different downstream tasks and adaptively remove redundant structures and neurons in different encoders with controllable target sparsity. We apply our framework to train EfficientVLM, a fast and accurate vision-language model consisting of 6 vision layers, 3 text layers, and 3 cross-modal fusion layers, accounting for only 93 million parameters in total, which is 44.3% of the teacher model. EfficientVLM retains 98.4% performance of the teacher model and accelerates its inference speed by 2.2x. EfficientVLM achieves a large absolute improvement over previous SoTA efficient VLMs of similar sizes by a large margin on various vision-language tasks, including VQAv2 (+4.9%), NLVR2 (+5.6%), ITR (R@1 on TR +17.2%, on IR + 15.6% ) and COCO caption generation (CIDEr +6.5), demonstrating a large potential on training lightweight VLMs.

**Abstract:** We present a system for anomaly detection in histopathological images. In histology, normal samples are usually abundant, whereas anomalous (pathological) cases are scarce or not available. Under such settings, one-class classifiers trained on healthy data can detect out-of-distribution anomalous samples. Such approaches combined with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) representations of images were previously employed for anomaly detection (AD). However, pre-trained off-the-shelf CNN representations may not be sensitive to abnormal conditions in tissues, while natural variations of healthy tissue may result in distant representations. To adapt representations to relevant details in healthy tissue we propose training a CNN on an auxiliary task that discriminates healthy tissue of different species, organs, and staining reagents. Almost no additional labeling workload is required, since healthy samples come automatically with aforementioned labels. During training we enforce compact image representations with a center-loss term, which further improves representations for AD. The proposed system outperforms established AD methods on a published dataset of liver anomalies. Moreover, it provided comparable results to conventional methods specifically tailored for quantification of liver anomalies. We show that our approach can be used for toxicity assessment of candidate drugs at early development stages and thereby may reduce expensive late-stage drug attrition.

**Abstract:** We study Nash equilibria learning of a general-sum stochastic game with an unknown transition probability density function. Agents take actions at the current environment state and their joint action influences the transition of the environment state and their immediate rewards. Each agent only observes the environment state and its own immediate reward and is unknown about the actions or immediate rewards of others. We introduce the concepts of weighted asymptotic Nash equilibrium with probability 1 and in probability. For the case with exact pseudo gradients, we design a two-loop algorithm by the equivalence of Nash equilibrium and variational inequality problems. In the outer loop, we sequentially update a constructed strongly monotone variational inequality by updating a proximal parameter while employing a single-call extra-gradient algorithm in the inner loop for solving the constructed variational inequality. We show that if the associated Minty variational inequality has a solution, then the designed algorithm converges to the k^{1/2}-weighted asymptotic Nash equilibrium. Further, for the case with unknown pseudo gradients, we propose a decentralized algorithm, where the G(PO)MDP gradient estimator of the pseudo gradient is provided by Monte-Carlo simulations. The convergence to the k^{1/4} -weighted asymptotic Nash equilibrium in probability is achieved.

**Abstract:** Multimodal sensors (e.g., visual, non-visual, and wearable) provide complementary information to develop robust perception systems for recognizing activities. However, most existing algorithms use dense sampling and heterogeneous sub-network to extract unimodal features and fuse them at the end of their framework, which causes data redundancy, lack of complementary multimodal information and high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new novel multimodal neural architecture based on RGB and IMU wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) for human activity recognition called Multimodal Temporal Segment Attention Network (MMTSA). MMTSA first employs a multimodal data isomorphism mechanism based on Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and then applies a novel multimodal sparse sampling method to reduce redundancy. Moreover, we propose an inter-segment attention module in MMTSA to fuse multimodal features effectively and efficiently. We demonstrate the importance of imu data imaging and attention mechanism in human activity recognition by rigorous evaluation on three public datasets, and achieve superior improvements ($11.13\%$ on the MMAct dataset) than the previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Dynamic interaction graphs have been widely adopted to model the evolution of user-item interactions over time. There are two crucial factors when modelling user preferences for link prediction in dynamic interaction graphs: 1) collaborative relationship among users and 2) user personalized interaction patterns. Existing methods often implicitly consider these two factors together, which may lead to noisy user modelling when the two factors diverge. In addition, they usually require time-consuming parameter learning with back-propagation, which is prohibitive for real-time user preference modelling. To this end, this paper proposes FreeGEM, a parameter-free dynamic graph embedding method for link prediction. Firstly, to take advantage of the collaborative relationships, we propose an incremental graph embedding engine to obtain user/item embeddings, which is an Online-Monitor-Offline architecture consisting of an Online module to approximately embed users/items over time, a Monitor module to estimate the approximation error in real time and an Offline module to calibrate the user/item embeddings when the online approximation errors exceed a threshold. Meanwhile, we integrate attribute information into the model, which enables FreeGEM to better model users belonging to some under represented groups. Secondly, we design a personalized dynamic interaction pattern modeller, which combines dynamic time decay with attention mechanism to model user short-term interests. Experimental results on two link prediction tasks show that FreeGEM can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while achieving over 36X improvement in efficiency.

**Abstract:** DBSCAN has been widely used in density-based clustering algorithms. However, with the increasing demand for Multi-density clustering, previous traditional DSBCAN can not have good clustering results on Multi-density datasets. In order to address this problem, an adaptive Multi-density DBSCAN algorithm (AMD-DBSCAN) is proposed in this paper. An improved parameter adaptation method is proposed in AMD-DBSCAN to search for multiple parameter pairs (i.e., Eps and MinPts), which are the key parameters to determine the clustering results and performance, therefore allowing the model to be applied to Multi-density datasets. Moreover, only one hyperparameter is required for AMD-DBSCAN to avoid the complicated repetitive initialization operations. Furthermore, the variance of the number of neighbors (VNN) is proposed to measure the difference in density between each cluster. The experimental results show that our AMD-DBSCAN reduces execution time by an average of 75% due to lower algorithm complexity compared with the traditional adaptive algorithm. In addition, AMD-DBSCAN improves accuracy by 24.7% on average over the state-of-the-art design on Multi-density datasets of extremely variable density, while having no performance loss in Single-density scenarios.

**Abstract:** The benefits of medical imaging are enormous. Medical images provide considerable amounts of anatomical information and this facilitates medical practitioners in performing effective disease diagnosis and deciding upon the best course of medical treatment. A transition from traditional monochromatic medical images like CT scans, X-Rays or MRI images to a colored 3D representation of the anatomical structure further enhances the capabilities of medical professionals in extracting valuable medical information. The proposed framework in our research starts with performing color transfer by finding deep semantic correspondence between two medical images: a colored reference image, and a monochromatic CT scan or an MRI image. We extend this idea of reference-based colorization technique to perform colored volume rendering from a stack of grayscale medical images. Furthermore, we also propose to use an effective reference image recommendation system to aid in the selection of good reference images. With our approach, we successfully perform colored medical volume visualization and essentially eliminate the painstaking process of user interaction with a transfer function to obtain color and opacity parameters for volume rendering.

**Abstract:** Learning-based perception and prediction modules in modern autonomous driving systems typically rely on expensive human annotation and are designed to perceive only a handful of predefined object categories. This closed-set paradigm is insufficient for the safety-critical autonomous driving task, where the autonomous vehicle needs to process arbitrarily many types of traffic participants and their motion behaviors in a highly dynamic world. To address this difficulty, this paper pioneers a novel and challenging direction, i.e., training perception and prediction models to understand open-set moving objects, with no human supervision. Our proposed framework uses self-learned flow to trigger an automated meta labeling pipeline to achieve automatic supervision. 3D detection experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that our method significantly outperforms classical unsupervised approaches and is even competitive to the counterpart with supervised scene flow. We further show that our approach generates highly promising results in open-set 3D detection and trajectory prediction, confirming its potential in closing the safety gap of fully supervised systems.

**Abstract:** In this article, we propose a variational inference formulation of auto-associative memories, allowing us to combine perceptual inference and memory retrieval into the same mathematical framework. In this formulation, the prior probability distribution onto latent representations is made memory dependent, thus pulling the inference process towards previously stored representations. We then study how different neural network approaches to variational inference can be applied in this framework. We compare methods relying on amortized inference such as Variational Auto Encoders and methods relying on iterative inference such as Predictive Coding and suggest combining both approaches to design new auto-associative memory models. We evaluate the obtained algorithms on the CIFAR10 and CLEVR image datasets and compare them with other associative memory models such as Hopfield Networks, End-to-End Memory Networks and Neural Turing Machines.

**Abstract:** We propose learnable polyphase sampling (LPS), a pair of learnable down/upsampling layers that enable truly shift-invariant and equivariant convolutional networks. LPS can be trained end-to-end from data and generalizes existing handcrafted downsampling layers. It is widely applicable as it can be integrated into any convolutional network by replacing down/upsampling layers. We evaluate LPS on image classification and semantic segmentation. Experiments show that LPS is on-par with or outperforms existing methods in both performance and shift consistency. For the first time, we achieve true shift-equivariance on semantic segmentation (PASCAL VOC), i.e., 100% shift consistency, outperforming baselines by an absolute 3.3%.

**Abstract:** Natural language processing (NLP) models are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which poses a newly arisen threat to NLP models. Prior online backdoor defense methods for NLP models only focus on the anomalies at either the input or output level, still suffering from fragility to adaptive attacks and high computational cost. In this work, we take the first step to investigate the unconcealment of textual poisoned samples at the intermediate-feature level and propose a feature-based efficient online defense method. Through extensive experiments on existing attacking methods, we find that the poisoned samples are far away from clean samples in the intermediate feature space of a poisoned NLP model. Motivated by this observation, we devise a distance-based anomaly score (DAN) to distinguish poisoned samples from clean samples at the feature level. Experiments on sentiment analysis and offense detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of DAN, as it substantially surpasses existing online defense methods in terms of defending performance and enjoys lower inference costs. Moreover, we show that DAN is also resistant to adaptive attacks based on feature-level regularization. Our code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/DAN.

<p>

**Abstract:** The biggest challenge for the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) close to the generated data on edge devices is their size, i.e., memory footprint and computational complexity. Both are significantly reduced with quantization. With the resulting lower word-length, the energy efficiency of DNNs increases proportionally. However, lower word-length typically causes accuracy degradation. To counteract this effect, the quantized DNN is retrained. Unfortunately, training costs up to 5000x more energy than the inference of the quantized DNN. To address this issue, we propose a post-training quantization flow without the need for retraining. For this, we investigated different quantization options. Furthermore, our analysis systematically assesses the impact of reduced word-lengths of weights and activations revealing a clear trend for the choice of word-length. Both aspects have not been systematically investigated so far. Our results are independent of the depth of the DNNs and apply to uniform quantization, allowing fast quantization of a given pre-trained DNN. We excel state-of-the-art for 6 bit by 2.2% Top-1 accuracy for ImageNet. Without retraining, our quantization to 8 bit surpasses floating-point accuracy.

<p>

**Abstract:** Industrial defect detection is commonly addressed with anomaly detection (AD) methods where no or only incomplete data of potentially occurring defects is available. This work discovers previously unknown problems of student-teacher approaches for AD and proposes a solution, where two neural networks are trained to produce the same output for the defect-free training examples. The core assumption of student-teacher networks is that the distance between the outputs of both networks is larger for anomalies since they are absent in training. However, previous methods suffer from the similarity of student and teacher architecture, such that the distance is undesirably small for anomalies. For this reason, we propose asymmetric student-teacher networks (AST). We train a normalizing flow for density estimation as a teacher and a conventional feed-forward network as a student to trigger large distances for anomalies: The bijectivity of the normalizing flow enforces a divergence of teacher outputs for anomalies compared to normal data. Outside the training distribution the student cannot imitate this divergence due to its fundamentally different architecture. Our AST network compensates for wrongly estimated likelihoods by a normalizing flow, which was alternatively used for anomaly detection in previous work. We show that our method produces state-of-the-art results on the two currently most relevant defect detection datasets MVTec AD and MVTec 3D-AD regarding image-level anomaly detection on RGB and 3D data.

**Abstract:** Pretrained Transformers (PT) have been shown to improve Out of Distribution (OOD) robustness than traditional models such as Bag of Words (BOW), LSTMs, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) powered by Word2Vec and Glove embeddings. How does the robustness comparison hold in a real world setting where some part of the dataset can be noisy? Do PT also provide more robust representation than traditional models on exposure to noisy data? We perform a comparative study on 10 models and find an empirical evidence that PT provide less robust representation than traditional models on exposure to noisy data. We investigate further and augment PT with an adversarial filtering (AF) mechanism that has been shown to improve OOD generalization. However, increase in generalization does not necessarily increase robustness, as we find that noisy data fools the AF method powered by PT.

**Abstract:** Many NLP classification tasks, such as sexism/racism detection or toxicity detection, are based on human values. Yet, human values can vary under diverse cultural conditions. Therefore, we introduce a framework for value-aligned classification that performs prediction based on explicitly written human values in the command. Along with the task, we propose a practical approach that distills value-aligned knowledge from large-scale language models (LLMs) to construct value-aligned classifiers in two steps. First, we generate value-aligned training data from LLMs by prompt-based few-shot learning. Next, we fine-tune smaller classification models with the generated data for the task. Empirical results show that our VA-Models surpass multiple baselines by at least 15.56% on the F1-score, including few-shot learning with OPT-175B and existing text augmentation methods. We suggest that using classifiers with explicit human value input improves both inclusivity & explainability in AI.

**Abstract:** Recently vision transformers (ViT) have been applied successfully for various tasks in computer vision. However, important questions such as why they work or how they behave still remain largely unknown. In this paper, we propose an effective visualization technique, to assist us in exposing the information carried in neurons and feature embeddings across the ViT's layers. Our approach departs from the computational process of ViTs with a focus on visualizing the local and global information in input images and the latent feature embeddings at multiple levels. Visualizations at the input and embeddings at level 0 reveal interesting findings such as providing support as to why ViTs are rather generally robust to image occlusions and patch shuffling; or unlike CNNs, level 0 embeddings already carry rich semantic details. Next, we develop a rigorous framework to perform effective visualizations across layers, exposing the effects of ViTs filters and grouping/clustering behaviors to object patches. Finally, we provide comprehensive experiments on real datasets to qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the merit of our proposed methods as well as our findings. https://github.com/byM1902/ViT_visualization

**Abstract:** Evaluation of models on benchmarks is unreliable without knowing the degree of sample hardness; this subsequently overestimates the capability of AI systems and limits their adoption in real world applications. We propose a Data Scoring task that requires assignment of each unannotated sample in a benchmark a score between 0 to 1, where 0 signifies easy and 1 signifies hard. Use of unannotated samples in our task design is inspired from humans who can determine a question difficulty without knowing its correct answer. This also rules out the use of methods involving model based supervision (since they require sample annotations to get trained), eliminating potential biases associated with models in deciding sample difficulty. We propose a method based on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for this task; we validate our method by showing that existing models are more accurate with respect to the easier sample-chunks than with respect to the harder sample-chunks. Finally we demonstrate five novel applications.

**Abstract:** Generative models are designed to address the data scarcity problem. Even with the exploding amount of data, due to computational advancements, some applications (e.g., health care, weather forecast, fault detection) still suffer from data insufficiency, especially in the time-series domain. Thus generative models are essential and powerful tools, but they still lack a consensual approach for quality assessment. Such deficiency hinders the confident application of modern implicit generative models on time-series data. Inspired by assessment methods on the image domain, we introduce the InceptionTime Score (ITS) and the Frechet InceptionTime Distance (FITD) to gauge the qualitative performance of class conditional generative models on the time-series domain. We conduct extensive experiments on 80 different datasets to study the discriminative capabilities of proposed metrics alongside two existing evaluation metrics: Train on Synthetic Test on Real (TSTR) and Train on Real Test on Synthetic (TRTS). Extensive evaluation reveals that the proposed assessment method, i.e., ITS and FITD in combination with TSTR, can accurately assess class-conditional generative model performance.

**Abstract:** The quality of many modern machine learning models improves as model complexity increases, an effect that has been quantified, for predictive performance, with the non-monotonic double descent learning curve. Here, we address the overarching question: is there an analogous theory of double descent for models which estimate uncertainty? We provide a partially affirmative and partially negative answer in the setting of Gaussian processes (GP). Under standard assumptions, we prove that higher model quality for optimally-tuned GPs (including uncertainty prediction) under marginal likelihood is realized for larger input dimensions, and therefore exhibits a monotone error curve. After showing that marginal likelihood does not naturally exhibit double descent in the input dimension, we highlight related forms of posterior predictive loss that do exhibit non-monotonicity. Finally, we verify empirically that our results hold for real data, beyond our considered assumptions, and we explore consequences involving synthetic covariates.

**Abstract:** Domain generalization (DG) enables generalizing a learning machine from multiple seen source domains to an unseen target one. The general objective of DG methods is to learn semantic representations that are independent of domain labels, which is theoretically sound but empirically challenged due to the complex mixture of common and domain-specific factors. Although disentangling the representations into two disjoint parts has been gaining momentum in DG, the strong presumption over the data limits its efficacy in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Mix and Reason (\mire), a new DG framework that learns semantic representations via enforcing the structural invariance of semantic topology. \mire\ consists of two key components, namely, Category-aware Data Mixing (CDM) and Adaptive Semantic Topology Refinement (ASTR). CDM mixes two images from different domains in virtue of activation maps generated by two complementary classification losses, making the classifier focus on the representations of semantic objects. ASTR introduces relation graphs to represent semantic topology, which is progressively refined via the interactions between local feature aggregation and global cross-domain relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple DG benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed \mire.

**Abstract:** Several benchmarks have been built with heavy investment in resources to track our progress in NLP. Thousands of papers published in response to those benchmarks have competed to top leaderboards, with models often surpassing human performance. However, recent studies have shown that models triumph over several popular benchmarks just by overfitting on spurious biases, without truly learning the desired task. Despite this finding, benchmarking, while trying to tackle bias, still relies on workarounds, which do not fully utilize the resources invested in benchmark creation, due to the discarding of low quality data, and cover limited sets of bias. A potential solution to these issues -- a metric quantifying quality -- remains underexplored. Inspired by successful quality indices in several domains such as power, food, and water, we take the first step towards a metric by identifying certain language properties that can represent various possible interactions leading to biases in a benchmark. We look for bias related parameters which can potentially help pave our way towards the metric. We survey existing works and identify parameters capturing various properties of bias, their origins, types and impact on performance, generalization, and robustness. Our analysis spans over datasets and a hierarchy of tasks ranging from NLI to Summarization, ensuring that our parameters are generic and are not overfitted towards a specific task or dataset. We also develop certain parameters in this process.

**Abstract:** Dataset bias has attracted increasing attention recently for its detrimental effect on the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. The current mainstream solution is designing an additional shallow model to pre-identify biased instances. However, such two-stage methods scale up the computational complexity of training process and obstruct valid feature information while mitigating bias. To address this issue, we utilize the representation normalization method which aims at disentangling the correlations between features of encoded sentences. We find it also promising in eliminating the bias problem by providing isotropic data distribution. We further propose Kernel-Whitening, a Nystrom kernel approximation method to achieve more thorough debiasing on nonlinear spurious correlations. Our framework is end-to-end with similar time consumption to fine-tuning. Experiments show that Kernel-Whitening significantly improves the performance of BERT on out-of-distribution datasets while maintaining in-distribution accuracy.

**Abstract:** Solar energy is one of the most dependable renewable energy technologies, as it is feasible almost everywhere globally. However, improving the efficiency of a solar PV system remains a significant challenge. To enhance the robustness of the solar system, this paper proposes a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) based fault detection scheme to divide the images of photovoltaic modules. For binary classification, the algorithm classifies the input images of PV cells into two categories (i.e. faulty or normal). To further assess the network's capability, the defective PV cells are organized into shadowy, cracked, or dusty cells, and the model is utilized for multiple classifications. The success rate for the proposed CNN model is 91.1% for binary classification and 88.6% for multi-classification. Thus, the proposed trained CNN model remarkably outperforms the CNN model presented in a previous study which used the same datasets. The proposed CNN-based fault detection model is straightforward, simple and effective and could be applied in the fault detection of solar panel.

**Abstract:** Models from the Vision Transformer (ViT) family have recently provided breakthrough results across image classification tasks such as ImageNet. Yet, they still face barriers to deployment, notably the fact that their accuracy can be severely impacted by compression techniques such as pruning. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by introducing Optimal ViT Surgeon (oViT), a new state-of-the-art method for the weight sparsification of Vision Transformers (ViT) models. At the technical level, oViT introduces a new weight pruning algorithm which leverages second-order information, specifically adapted to be both highly-accurate and efficient in the context of ViTs. We complement this accurate one-shot pruner with an in-depth investigation of gradual pruning, augmentation, and recovery schedules for ViTs, which we show to be critical for successful ViT compression. We validate our method via extensive experiments on classical ViT and DeiT models, as well as on newer variants, such as XCiT, EfficientFormer and Swin. Moreover, our results are even relevant to recently-proposed highly-accurate ResNets. Our results show for the first time that ViT-family models can in fact be pruned to high sparsity levels (e.g. $\geq 75\%$) with low impact on accuracy ($\leq 1\%$ relative drop), and that our approach outperforms prior methods by significant margins at high sparsities. In addition, we show that our method is compatible with structured pruning methods and quantization, and that it can lead to significant speedups on a sparsity-aware inference engine.

**Abstract:** Complete depth information and efficient estimators have become vital ingredients in scene understanding for automated driving tasks. A major problem for LiDAR-based depth completion is the inefficient utilization of convolutions due to the lack of coherent information as provided by the sparse nature of uncorrelated LiDAR point clouds, which often leads to complex and resource-demanding networks. The problem is reinforced by the expensive aquisition of depth data for supervised training. In this work, we propose an efficient depth completion model based on a vgg05-like CNN architecture and propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation approach to transfer knowledge from synthetic to real world data to improve data-efficiency and reduce the need for a large database. In order to boost spatial coherence, we guide the learning process using segmentations as additional source of information. The efficiency and accuracy of our approach is evaluated on the KITTI dataset. Our approach improves on previous efficient and low parameter state of the art approaches while having a noticeably lower computational footprint.

**Abstract:** Causal discovery aims to uncover causal structure among a set of variables. Score-based approaches mainly focus on searching for the best Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on a predefined score function. However, most of them are not applicable on a large scale due to the limited searchability. Inspired by the active learning in generative flow networks, we propose a novel approach to learning a DAG from observational data called GFlowCausal. It converts the graph search problem to a generation problem, in which direct edges are added gradually. GFlowCausal aims to learn the best policy to generate high-reward DAGs by sequential actions with probabilities proportional to predefined rewards. We propose a plug-and-play module based on transitive closure to ensure efficient sampling. Theoretical analysis shows that this module could guarantee acyclicity properties effectively and the consistency between final states and fully-connected graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, and results show the proposed approach to be superior and also performs well in a large-scale setting.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised representation learning for speech audios attained impressive performances for speech recognition tasks, particularly when annotated speech is limited. However, the unsupervised paradigm needs to be carefully designed and little is known about what properties these representations acquire. There is no guarantee that the model learns meaningful representations for valuable information for recognition. Moreover, the adaptation ability of the learned representations to other domains still needs to be estimated. In this work, we explore learning domain-invariant representations via a direct mapping of speech representations to their corresponding high-level linguistic informations. Results prove that the learned latents not only capture the articulatory feature of each phoneme but also enhance the adaptation ability, outperforming the baseline largely on accented benchmarks.

**Abstract:** In leveraging manifold learning in domain adaptation (DA), graph embedding-based DA methods have shown their effectiveness in preserving data manifold through the Laplace graph. However, current graph embedding DA methods suffer from two issues: 1). they are only concerned with preservation of the underlying data structures in the embedding and ignore sub-domain adaptation, which requires taking into account intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity, thereby leading to negative transfer; 2). manifold learning is proposed across different feature/label spaces separately, thereby hindering unified comprehensive manifold learning. In this paper, starting from our previous DGA-DA, we propose a novel DA method, namely Attention Regularized Laplace Graph-based Domain Adaptation (ARG-DA), to remedy the aforementioned issues. Specifically, by weighting the importance across different sub-domain adaptation tasks, we propose the Attention Regularized Laplace Graph for class-aware DA, thereby generating the attention regularized DA. Furthermore, using a specifically designed FEEL strategy, our approach dynamically unifies alignment of the manifold structures across different feature/label spaces, thus leading to comprehensive manifold learning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DA method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DA methods on 7 standard DA benchmarks, i.e., 37 cross-domain image classification tasks including object, face, and digit images. An in-depth analysis of the proposed DA method is also discussed, including sensitivity, convergence, and robustness.

**Abstract:** Pseudo Artificial Intelligence bias (PAIB) is broadly disseminated in the literature, which can result in unnecessary AI fear in society, exacerbate the enduring inequities and disparities in access to and sharing the benefits of AI applications, and waste social capital invested in AI research. This study systematically reviews publications in the literature to present three types of PAIBs identified due to: a) misunderstandings, b) pseudo mechanical bias, and c) over-expectations. We discussed the consequences of and solutions to PAIBs, including certifying users for AI applications to mitigate AI fears, providing customized user guidance for AI applications, and developing systematic approaches to monitor bias. We concluded that PAIB due to misunderstandings, pseudo mechanical bias, and over-expectations of algorithmic predictions is socially harmful.

**Abstract:** Nonlinear dynamics are ubiquitous in science and engineering applications, but the physics of most complex systems is far from being fully understood. Discovering interpretable governing equations from measurement data can help us understand and predict the behavior of complex dynamic systems. Although extensive work has recently been done in this field, robustly distilling explicit model forms from very sparse data with considerable noise remains intractable. Moreover, quantifying and propagating the uncertainty of the identified system from noisy data is challenging, and relevant literature is still limited. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel Bayesian spline learning framework to identify parsimonious governing equations of nonlinear (spatio)temporal dynamics from sparse, noisy data with quantified uncertainty. The proposed method utilizes spline basis to handle the data scarcity and measurement noise, upon which a group of derivatives can be accurately computed to form a library of candidate model terms. The equation residuals are used to inform the spline learning in a Bayesian manner, where approximate Bayesian uncertainty calibration techniques are employed to approximate posterior distributions of the trainable parameters. To promote the sparsity, an iterative sequential-threshold Bayesian learning approach is developed, using the alternative direction optimization strategy to systematically approximate L0 sparsity constraints. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on multiple nonlinear dynamical systems governed by canonical ordinary and partial differential equations, and the merit/superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Modern-day display systems demand high-quality rendering. However, rendering at higher resolution requires a large number of data samples and is computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning-based image and video super-resolution techniques motivate us to investigate such networks for high-fidelity upscaling of frames rendered at a lower resolution to a higher resolution. While our work focuses on super-resolution of medical volume visualization performed with direct volume rendering, it is also applicable for volume visualization with other rendering techniques. We propose a learning-based technique where our proposed system uses color information along with other supplementary features gathered from our volume renderer to learn efficient upscaling of a low-resolution rendering to a higher-resolution space. Furthermore, to improve temporal stability, we also implement the temporal reprojection technique for accumulating history samples in volumetric rendering.

**Abstract:** Background: A crucial initial processing step for quantitative PET/CT analysis is the segmentation of tumor lesions enabling accurate feature ex-traction, tumor characterization, oncologic staging, and image-based therapy response assessment. Manual lesion segmentation is however associated with enormous effort and cost and is thus infeasible in clinical routine. Goal: The goal of this study was to report the performance of a deep neural network designed to automatically segment regions suspected of cancer in whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT images in the context of the AutoPET challenge. Method: A cascaded approach was developed where a stacked ensemble of 3D UNET CNN processed the PET/CT images at a fixed 6mm resolution. A refiner network composed of residual layers enhanced the 6mm segmentation mask to the original resolution. Results: 930 cases were used to train the model. 50% were histologically proven cancer patients and 50% were healthy controls. We obtained a dice=0.68 on 84 stratified test cases. Manual and automatic Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV) were highly correlated (R2 = 0.969,Slope = 0.947). Inference time was 89.7 seconds on average. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm accurately segmented regions suspicious for cancer in whole-body 18F -FDG PET/CT images.

**Abstract:** Path prediction is an essential task for several real-world real-time applications, from autonomous driving and video surveillance to environmental monitoring. Most existing approaches are computation-intensive and only target a narrow domain (e.g., a specific point of view for a particular subject). However, many real-time applications demand a universal path predictor that can work across different subjects (vehicles, pedestrians), perspectives (bird's-eye, high-angle), and scenes (sidewalk, highway). This article proposes Pishgu, a universal graph isomorphism approach for attentive path prediction that accounts for environmental challenges. Pishgu captures the inter-dependencies within the subjects in each frame by taking advantage of Graph Isomorphism Networks. In addition, an attention module is adopted to represent the intrinsic relations of the subjects of interest with their surroundings. We evaluate the adaptability of our approach to multiple publicly available vehicle (bird's-eye view) and pedestrian (bird's-eye and high-angle view) path prediction datasets. Pishgu's universal solution outperforms existing domain-focused methods by producing state-of-the-art results for vehicle bird's-eye view by 42% and 61% and pedestrian high-angle views by 23% and 22% in terms of ADE and FDE, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the domain-specific details for various datasets to understand their effect on path prediction and model interpretation. Although our model is a single solution for path prediction problems and defines a new standard in multiple domains, it still has a comparable complexity to state-of-the-art models, which makes it suitable for real-world application. We also report the latency and throughput for all three domains on multiple embedded processors.

**Abstract:** Artifacts on magnetic resonance scans are a serious challenge for both radiologists and computer-aided diagnosis systems. Most commonly, artifacts are caused by motion of the patients, but can also arise from device-specific abnormalities such as noise patterns. Irrespective of the source, artifacts can not only render a scan useless, but can potentially induce misdiagnoses if left unnoticed. For instance, an artifact may masquerade as a tumor or other abnormality. Retrospective artifact correction (RAC) is concerned with removing artifacts after the scan has already been taken. In this work, we propose a method capable of retrospectively removing eight common artifacts found in native-resolution MR imagery. Knowledge of the presence or location of a specific artifact is not assumed and the system is, by design, capable of undoing interactions of multiple artifacts. Our method is realized through the design of a novel volumetric transformer-based neural network that generalizes a \emph{window-centered} approach popularized by the Swin transformer. Unlike Swin, our method is (i) natively volumetric, (ii) geared towards dense prediction tasks instead of classification, and (iii), uses a novel and more global mechanism to enable information exchange between windows. Our experiments show that our reconstructions are considerably better than those attained by ResNet, V-Net, MobileNet-v2, DenseNet, CycleGAN and BicycleGAN. Moreover, we show that the reconstructed images from our model improves the accuracy of FSL BET, a standard skull-stripping method typically applied in diagnostic workflows.

**Abstract:** Although supervised learning has enabled high performance for image segmentation, it requires a large amount of labeled training data, which can be difficult to obtain in the medical imaging field. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods involving pretext tasks have shown promise in overcoming this requirement by first pretraining models using unlabeled data. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of two SSL methods (inpainting-based pretext tasks of context prediction and context restoration) for CT and MRI image segmentation in label-limited scenarios, and investigate the effect of implementation design choices for SSL on downstream segmentation performance. We demonstrate that optimally trained and easy-to-implement inpainting-based SSL segmentation models can outperform classically supervised methods for MRI and CT tissue segmentation in label-limited scenarios, for both clinically-relevant metrics and the traditional Dice score.

**Abstract:** Motion generation in cluttered, dense, and dynamic environments is a central topic in robotics, rendered as a multi-objective decision-making problem. Current approaches trade-off between safety and performance. On the one hand, reactive policies guarantee fast response to environmental changes at the risk of suboptimal behavior. On the other hand, planning-based motion generation provides feasible trajectories, but the high computational cost may limit the control frequency and thus safety. To combine the benefits of reactive policies and planning, we propose a hierarchical motion generation method. Moreover, we adopt probabilistic inference methods to formalize the hierarchical model and stochastic optimization. We realize this approach as a weighted product of stochastic, reactive expert policies, where planning is used to adaptively compute the optimal weights over the task horizon. This stochastic optimization avoids local optima and proposes feasible reactive plans that find paths in cluttered and dense environments. Our extensive experimental study in planar navigation and 6DoF manipulation shows that our proposed hierarchical motion generation method outperforms both myopic reactive controllers and online re-planning methods.

Finally, we conclude with a discussion of related approaches to disentanglement and how they relate to our view of disentanglement from the manifold perspective.

We use a dataset of postoperative MRI volumes, each including four MRI sequences and the ground truth of the corresponding resection cavity. Four solutions are trained with a different MRI sequence. Besides, a method designed with all the available sequences is also presented.

**Abstract:** Numerous oncology indications have extensively quantified metabolically active tumors using positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT). F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is frequently utilized in clinical practice and clinical drug research to detect and measure metabolically active malignancies. The assessment of tumor burden using manual or computer-assisted tumor segmentation in FDG-PET images is widespread. Deep learning algorithms have also produced effective solutions in this area. However, there may be a need to improve the performance of a pre-trained deep learning network without the opportunity to modify this network. We investigate the potential benefits of test-time augmentation for segmenting tumors from PET-CT pairings. We applied a new framework of multilevel and multimodal tumor segmentation techniques that can simultaneously consider PET and CT data. In this study, we improve the network using a learnable composition of test time augmentations. We trained U-Net and Swin U-Netr on the training database to determine how different test time augmentation improved segmentation performance. We also developed an algorithm that finds an optimal test time augmentation contribution coefficient set. Using the newly trained U-Net and Swin U-Netr results, we defined an optimal set of coefficients for test-time augmentation and utilized them in combination with a pre-trained fixed nnU-Net. The ultimate idea is to improve performance at the time of testing when the model is fixed. Averaging the predictions with varying ratios on the augmented data can improve prediction accuracy.

**Abstract:** Novel category discovery aims at adapting models trained on known categories to novel categories. Previous works only focus on the scenario where known and novel categories are of the same granularity. In this paper, we investigate a new practical scenario called Fine-grained Category Discovery under Coarse-grained supervision (FCDC). FCDC aims at discovering fine-grained categories with only coarse-grained labeled data, which can adapt models to categories of different granularity from known ones and reduce significant labeling cost. It is also a challenging task since supervised training on coarse-grained categories tends to focus on inter-class distance (distance between coarse-grained classes) but ignore intra-class distance (distance between fine-grained sub-classes) which is essential for separating fine-grained categories. Considering most current methods cannot transfer knowledge from coarse-grained level to fine-grained level, we propose a hierarchical weighted self-contrastive network by building a novel weighted self-contrastive module and combining it with supervised learning in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experiments on public datasets show both effectiveness and efficiency of our model over compared methods.

**Abstract:** Various privacy-preserving frameworks that respect the individual's privacy in the analysis of data have been developed in recent years. However, available model classes such as simple statistics or generalized linear models lack the flexibility required for a good approximation of the underlying data-generating process in practice. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for a distributed, privacy-preserving, and lossless estimation of generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) using component-wise gradient boosting (CWB). Making use of CWB allows us to reframe the GAMM estimation as a distributed fitting of base learners using the $L_2$-loss. In order to account for the heterogeneity of different data location sites, we propose a distributed version of a row-wise tensor product that allows the computation of site-specific (smooth) effects. Our adaption of CWB preserves all the important properties of the original algorithm, such as an unbiased feature selection and the feasibility to fit models in high-dimensional feature spaces, and yields equivalent model estimates as CWB on pooled data. Next to a derivation of the equivalence of both algorithms, we also showcase the efficacy of our algorithm on a distributed heart disease data set and compare it with state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** This paper presents an optimized methodology to design and deploy Speech Enhancement (SE) algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on a state-of-the-art MicroController Unit (MCU), with 1+8 general-purpose RISC-V cores. To achieve low-latency execution, we propose an optimized software pipeline interleaving parallel computation of LSTM or GRU recurrent blocks, featuring vectorized 8-bit integer (INT8) and 16-bit floating-point (FP16) compute units, with manually-managed memory transfers of model parameters. To ensure minimal accuracy degradation with respect to the full-precision models, we propose a novel FP16-INT8 Mixed-Precision Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) scheme that compresses the recurrent layers to 8-bit while the bit precision of remaining layers is kept to FP16. Experiments are conducted on multiple LSTM and GRU based SE models trained on the Valentini dataset, featuring up to 1.24M parameters. Thanks to the proposed approaches, we speed-up the computation by up to 4x with respect to the lossless FP16 baselines. Differently from a uniform 8-bit quantization that degrades the PESQ score by 0.3 on average, the Mixed-Precision PTQ scheme leads to a low-degradation of only 0.06, while achieving a 1.4-1.7x memory saving. Thanks to this compression, we cut the power cost of the external memory by fitting the large models on the limited on-chip non-volatile memory and we gain a MCU power saving of up to 2.5x by reducing the supply voltage from 0.8V to 0.65V while still matching the real-time constraints. Our design results 10x more energy efficient than state-of-the-art SE solutions deployed on single-core MCUs that make use of smaller models and quantization-aware training.

**Abstract:** Large-scale vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models are prone to hallucinate non-existent visual objects when generating text based on visual information. In this paper, we exhaustively probe the object hallucination problem from three aspects. First, we examine various state-of-the-art VLP models, showing that models achieving better scores on standard metrics(e.g., BLEU-4, CIDEr) could hallucinate objects more frequently. Second, we investigate how different types of visual features in VLP influence hallucination, including region-based, grid-based, and patch-based. Surprisingly, we find that patch-based features perform the best and smaller patch resolution yields a non-trivial reduction in object hallucination. Third, we decouple various VLP objectives and demonstrate their effectiveness in alleviating object hallucination. Based on that, we propose a new pre-training loss, object masked language modeling, to further reduce object hallucination. We evaluate models on both COCO (in-domain) and NoCaps (out-of-domain) datasets with our improved CHAIR metric. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various text decoding strategies and image augmentation methods on object hallucination.

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have shown exceptional scaling properties in the image synthesis domain, and initial attempts have shown similar benefits for applying diffusion to unconditional text synthesis. Denoising diffusion models attempt to iteratively refine a sampled noise signal until it resembles a coherent signal (such as an image or written sentence). In this work we aim to see whether the benefits of diffusion models can also be realized for speech recognition. To this end, we propose a new way to perform speech recognition using a diffusion model conditioned on pretrained speech features. Specifically, we propose TransFusion: a transcribing diffusion model which iteratively denoises a random character sequence into coherent text corresponding to the transcript of a conditioning utterance. We demonstrate comparable performance to existing high-performing contrastive models on the LibriSpeech speech recognition benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply denoising diffusion to speech recognition. We also propose new techniques for effectively sampling and decoding multinomial diffusion models. These are required because traditional methods of sampling from acoustic models are not possible with our new discrete diffusion approach.

**Abstract:** Landsat-8 (NASA) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) are two prominent multi-spectral imaging satellite projects that provide publicly available data. The multi-spectral imaging sensors of the satellites capture images of the earth's surface in the visible and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the majority of the earth's surface is constantly covered with clouds, which are not transparent at these wavelengths, many images do not provide much information. To increase the temporal availability of cloud-free images of a certain area, one can combine the observations from multiple sources. However, the sensors of satellites might differ in their properties, making the images incompatible. This work provides a first glance at the possibility of using a transformer-based model to reduce the spectral and spatial differences between observations from both satellite projects. We compare the results to a model based on a fully convolutional UNet architecture. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that, while deep models outperform classical approaches, the UNet significantly outperforms the transformer in our experiments.

**Abstract:** Banks hold a societal responsibility and regulatory requirements to mitigate the risk of financial crimes. Risk mitigation primarily happens through monitoring customer activity through Transaction Monitoring (TM). Recently, Machine Learning (ML) has been proposed to identify suspicious customer behavior, which raises complex socio-technical implications around trust and explainability of ML models and their outputs. However, little research is available due to its sensitivity. We aim to fill this gap by presenting empirical research exploring how ML supported automation and augmentation affects the TM process and stakeholders' requirements for building eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI). Our study finds that xAI requirements depend on the liable party in the TM process which changes depending on augmentation or automation of TM. Context-relatable explanations can provide much-needed support for auditing and may diminish bias in the investigator's judgement. These results suggest a use case-specific approach for xAI to adequately foster the adoption of ML in TM.

**Abstract:** There are two paradigms of emotion representation, categorical labeling and dimensional description in continuous space. Therefore, the emotion recognition task can be treated as a classification or regression. The main aim of this study is to investigate the relation between these two representations and propose a classification pipeline that uses only dimensional annotation. The proposed approach contains a regressor model which is trained to predict a vector of continuous values in dimensional representation for given speech audio. The output of this model can be interpreted as an emotional category using a mapping algorithm. We investigated the performances of a combination of three feature extractors, three neural network architectures, and three mapping algorithms on two different corpora. Our study shows the advantages and limitations of the classification via regression approach.

**Abstract:** Designing feasible and effective architectures under diverse computational budgets, incurred by different applications/devices, is essential for deploying deep models in real-world applications. To achieve this goal, existing methods often perform an independent architecture search process for each target budget, which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. More critically, these independent search processes cannot share their learned knowledge (i.e., the distribution of good architectures) with each other and thus often result in limited search results. To address these issues, we propose a Pareto-aware Neural Architecture Generator (PNAG) which only needs to be trained once and dynamically produces the Pareto optimal architecture for any given budget via inference. To train our PNAG, we learn the whole Pareto frontier by jointly finding multiple Pareto optimal architectures under diverse budgets. Such a joint search algorithm not only greatly reduces the overall search cost but also improves the search results. Extensive experiments on three hardware platforms (i.e., mobile device, CPU, and GPU) show the superiority of our method over existing methods.

**Abstract:** Affective computing strives to unveil the unknown relationship between affect elicitation, manifestation of affect and affect annotations. The ground truth of affect, however, is predominately attributed to the affect labels which inadvertently include biases inherent to the subjective nature of emotion and its labeling. The response to such limitations is usually augmenting the dataset with more annotations per data point; however, this is not possible when we are interested in self-reports via first-person annotation. Moreover, outlier detection methods based on inter-annotator agreement only consider the annotations themselves and ignore the context and the corresponding affect manifestation. This paper reframes the ways one may obtain a reliable ground truth of affect by transferring aspects of causation theory to affective computing. In particular, we assume that the ground truth of affect can be found in the causal relationships between elicitation, manifestation and annotation that remain \emph{invariant} across tasks and participants. To test our assumption we employ causation inspired methods for detecting outliers in affective corpora and building affect models that are robust across participants and tasks. We validate our methodology within the domain of digital games, with experimental results showing that it can successfully detect outliers and boost the accuracy of affect models. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first attempt to integrate causation tools in affective computing, making a crucial and decisive step towards general affect modeling.

**Abstract:** Deep Learning-based 2D/3D registration enables fast, robust, and accurate X-ray to CT image fusion when large annotated paired datasets are available for training. However, the need for paired CT volume and X-ray images with ground truth registration limits the applicability in interventional scenarios. An alternative is to use simulated X-ray projections from CT volumes, thus removing the need for paired annotated datasets. Deep Neural Networks trained exclusively on simulated X-ray projections can perform significantly worse on real X-ray images due to the domain gap. We propose a self-supervised 2D/3D registration framework combining simulated training with unsupervised feature and pixel space domain adaptation to overcome the domain gap and eliminate the need for paired annotated datasets. Our framework achieves a registration accuracy of 1.83$\pm$1.16 mm with a high success ratio of 90.1% on real X-ray images showing a 23.9% increase in success ratio compared to reference annotation-free algorithms.

**Abstract:** The issue of image haze removal has attracted wide attention in recent years. However, most existing haze removal methods cannot restore the scene with clear blue sky, since the color and texture information of the object in the original haze image is insufficient. To remedy this, we propose a cycle generative adversarial network to construct a novel end-to-end image dehaze model. We adopt outdoor image datasets to train our model, which includes a set of real-world unpaired image dataset and a set of paired image dataset to ensure that the generated images are close to the real scene. Based on the cycle structure, our model adds four different kinds of loss function to constrain the effect including adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, photorealism loss and paired L1 loss. These four constraints can improve the overall quality of such degraded images for better visual appeal and ensure reconstruction of images to keep from distortion. The proposed model could remove the haze of images and also restore the sky of images to be clean and blue (like captured in a sunny weather).

**Abstract:** Speech synthesis methods can create realistic-sounding speech, which may be used for fraud, spoofing, and misinformation campaigns. Forensic methods that detect synthesized speech are important for protection against such attacks. Forensic attribution methods provide even more information about the nature of synthesized speech signals because they identify the specific speech synthesis method (i.e., speech synthesizer) used to create a speech signal. Due to the increasing number of realistic-sounding speech synthesizers, we propose a speech attribution method that generalizes to new synthesizers not seen during training. To do so, we investigate speech synthesizer attribution in both a closed set scenario and an open set scenario. In other words, we consider some speech synthesizers to be "known" synthesizers (i.e., part of the closed set) and others to be "unknown" synthesizers (i.e., part of the open set). We represent speech signals as spectrograms and train our proposed method, known as compact attribution transformer (CAT), on the closed set for multi-class classification. Then, we extend our analysis to the open set to attribute synthesized speech signals to both known and unknown synthesizers. We utilize a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) on the latent space of the trained CAT to differentiate between each unknown synthesizer. Additionally, we explore poly-1 loss formulations to improve attribution results. Our proposed approach successfully attributes synthesized speech signals to their respective speech synthesizers in both closed and open set scenarios.

**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved competitive performance in broad vision tasks. Unfortunately, on popular threat models, naturally trained ViTs are shown to provide no more adversarial robustness than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Adversarial training is still required for ViTs to defend against such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we provide the first and comprehensive study on the adversarial training recipe of ViTs via extensive evaluation of various training techniques across benchmark datasets. We find that pre-training and SGD optimizer are necessary for ViTs' adversarial training. Further considering ViT as a new type of model architecture, we investigate its adversarial robustness from the perspective of its unique architectural components. We find, when randomly masking gradients from some attention blocks or masking perturbations on some patches during adversarial training, the adversarial robustness of ViTs can be remarkably improved, which may potentially open up a line of work to explore the architectural information inside the newly designed models like ViTs.

**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed the rise of misinformation campaigns that spread specific narratives on social media to manipulate public opinions on different areas, such as politics and healthcare. Consequently, an effective and efficient automatic methodology to estimate the influence of the misinformation on user beliefs and activities is needed. However, existing works on misinformation impact estimation either rely on small-scale psychological experiments or can only discover the correlation between user behaviour and misinformation. To address these issues, in this paper, we build up a causal framework that model the causal effect of misinformation from the perspective of temporal point process. To adapt the large-scale data, we design an efficient yet precise way to estimate the Individual Treatment Effect(ITE) via neural temporal point process and gaussian mixture models. Extensive experiments on synthetic dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. We further apply our model on a real-world dataset of social media posts and engagements about COVID-19 vaccines. The experimental results indicate that our model recognized identifiable causal effect of misinformation that hurts people's subjective emotions toward the vaccines.

**Abstract:** Nowadays, Hearth Rate (HR) monitoring is a key feature of almost all wrist-worn devices exploiting photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. However, arm movements affect the performance of PPG-based HR tracking. This issue is usually addressed by fusing the PPG signal with data produced by inertial measurement units. Thus, deep learning algorithms have been proposed, but they are considered too complex to deploy on wearable devices and lack the explainability of results. In this work, we present a new deep learning model, PULSE, which exploits temporal convolutions and multi-head cross-attention to improve sensor fusion's effectiveness and achieve a step towards explainability. We evaluate the performance of PULSE on three publicly available datasets, reducing the mean absolute error by 7.56% on the most extensive available dataset, PPG-DaLiA. Finally, we demonstrate the explainability of PULSE and the benefits of applying attention modules to PPG and motion data.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated complex decision-making capabilities in simulation environments such as Arcade Learning Environment, MuJoCo, and ViZDoom. However, they are hardly extensible to more complicated problems, mainly due to the lack of complexity and variations in the environments they are trained and tested on. Furthermore, they are not extensible to an open-world environment to facilitate long-term exploration research. To learn realistic task-solving capabilities, we need to develop an environment with greater diversity and complexity. We developed WILD-SCAV, a powerful and extensible environment based on a 3D open-world FPS (First-Person Shooter) game to bridge the gap. It provides realistic 3D environments of variable complexity, various tasks, and multiple modes of interaction, where agents can learn to perceive 3D environments, navigate and plan, compete and cooperate in a human-like manner. WILD-SCAV also supports different complexities, such as configurable maps with different terrains, building structures and distributions, and multi-agent settings with cooperative and competitive tasks. The experimental results on configurable complexity, multi-tasking, and multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of WILD-SCAV in benchmarking various RL algorithms, as well as it is potential to give rise to intelligent agents with generalized task-solving abilities.

**Abstract:** This research aims to develop machine learning models for students academic performance and study strategies prediction which could be generalized to all courses in higher education. Key learning attributes (intrinsic, extrinsic, autonomy, relatedness, competence, and self-esteem) essential for students learning process were used in building the models. Determining the broad effect of these attributes on students' academic performance and study strategy is the center of our interest. To investigate this, we used Scikit-learn in python to build five machine learning models (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, Linear/Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine) for both regression and classification tasks to perform our analysis. The models were trained, evaluated, and tested for accuracy using 924 university dentistry students' data collected by Chilean authors through quantitative research design. A comparative analysis of the models revealed that the tree-based models such as the random forest (with prediction accuracy of 94.9%) and decision tree show the best results compared to the linear, support vector, and k-nearest neighbours. The models built in this research can be used in predicting student performance and study strategy so that appropriate interventions could be implemented to improve student learning progress. Thus, incorporating strategies that could improve diverse student learning attributes in the design of online educational systems may increase the likelihood of students continuing with their learning tasks as required. Moreover, the results show that the attributes could be modelled together and used to adapt/personalize the learning process.

**Abstract:** Training end-to-end speech translation (ST) systems requires sufficiently large-scale data, which is unavailable for most language pairs and domains. One practical solution to the data scarcity issue is to convert machine translation data (MT) to ST data via text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Yet, using TTS systems can be tedious and slow, as the conversion needs to be done for each MT dataset. In this work, we propose a simple, scalable and effective data augmentation technique, i.e., SpokenVocab, to convert MT data to ST data on-the-fly. The idea is to retrieve and stitch audio snippets from a SpokenVocab bank according to words in an MT sequence. Our experiments on multiple language pairs from Must-C show that this method outperforms strong baselines by an average of 1.83 BLEU scores, and it performs equally well as TTS-generated speech. We also showcase how SpokenVocab can be applied in code-switching ST for which often no TTS systems exit. Our code is available at https://github.com/mingzi151/SpokenVocab

**Abstract:** Cognitive diagnosis is a fundamental yet critical research task in the field of intelligent education, which aims to discover the proficiency level of different students on specific knowledge concepts. Despite the effectiveness of existing efforts, previous methods always considered the mastery level on the whole students, so they still suffer from the Long Tail Effect. A large number of students who have sparse data are performed poorly in the model. To relieve the situation, we proposed a Self-supervised Cognitive Diagnosis (SCD) framework which leverages the self-supervised manner to assist the graph-based cognitive diagnosis, then the performance on those students with sparse data can be improved. Specifically, we came up with a graph confusion method that drops edges under some special rules to generate different sparse views of the graph. By maximizing the consistency of the representation on the same node under different views, the model could be more focused on long-tailed students. Additionally, we proposed an importance-based view generation rule to improve the influence of long-tailed students. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our approach, especially on the students with sparse data.

**Abstract:** This article presents a three-step framework for learning and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using kernel methods. Given a training set consisting of pairs of noisy PDE solutions and source/boundary terms on a mesh, kernel smoothing is utilized to denoise the data and approximate derivatives of the solution. This information is then used in a kernel regression model to learn the algebraic form of the PDE. The learned PDE is then used within a kernel based solver to approximate the solution of the PDE with a new source/boundary term, thereby constituting an operator learning framework. The proposed method is mathematically interpretable and amenable to analysis, and convenient to implement. Numerical experiments compare the method to state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrate its superior performance on small amounts of training data and for PDEs with spatially variable coefficients.

**Abstract:** Vertical heterogenous networks (VHetNets) and artificial intelligence (AI) play critical roles in 6G and beyond networks. This article presents an AI-native VHetNets architecture to enable the synergy of VHetNets and AI, thereby supporting varieties of AI services while facilitating automatic and intelligent network management. Anomaly detection in Internet of Things (IoT) is a major AI service required by many fields, including intrusion detection, state monitoring, device-activity analysis, security supervision and so on. Conventional anomaly detection technologies mainly consider the anomaly detection as a standalone service that is independent of any other network management functionalities, which cannot be used directly in ubiquitous IoT due to the resource constrained end nodes and decentralized data distribution. In this article, we develop an AI-native VHetNets-enabled framework to provide the anomaly detection service for ubiquitous IoT, whose implementation is assisted by intelligent network management functionalities. We first discuss the possibilities of VHetNets used for distributed AI model training to provide anomaly detection service for ubiquitous IoT, i.e., VHetNets for AI. After that, we study the application of AI approaches in helping provide automatic and intelligent network management functionalities for VHetNets, i.e., AI for VHetNets, whose aim is to facilitate the efficient implementation of anomaly detection service. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed AI-native VHetNets-enabled anomaly detection framework.

**Abstract:** An oft-cited challenge of federated learning is the presence of heterogeneity. \emph{Data heterogeneity} refers to the fact that data from different clients may follow very different distributions. \emph{System heterogeneity} refers to the fact that client devices have different system capabilities. A considerable number of federated optimization methods address this challenge. In the literature, empirical evaluations usually start federated training from random initialization. However, in many practical applications of federated learning, the server has access to proxy data for the training task that can be used to pre-train a model before starting federated training. We empirically study the impact of starting from a pre-trained model in federated learning using four standard federated learning benchmark datasets. Unsurprisingly, starting from a pre-trained model reduces the training time required to reach a target error rate and enables the training of more accurate models (up to 40\%) than is possible when starting from random initialization. Surprisingly, we also find that starting federated learning from a pre-trained initialization reduces the effect of both data and system heterogeneity. We recommend that future work proposing and evaluating federated optimization methods evaluate the performance when starting from random and pre-trained initializations. We also believe this study raises several questions for further work on understanding the role of heterogeneity in federated optimization.

**Abstract:** Contextual Bayesian optimization (CBO) is a powerful framework for sequential decision-making given side information, with important applications, e.g., in wind energy systems. In this setting, the learner receives context (e.g., weather conditions) at each round, and has to choose an action (e.g., turbine parameters). Standard algorithms assume no cost for switching their decisions at every round. However, in many practical applications, there is a cost associated with such changes, which should be minimized. We introduce the episodic CBO with movement costs problem and, based on the online learning approach for metrical task systems of Coester and Lee (2019), propose a novel randomized mirror descent algorithm that makes use of Gaussian Process confidence bounds. We compare its performance with the offline optimal sequence for each episode and provide rigorous regret guarantees. We further demonstrate our approach on the important real-world application of altitude optimization for Airborne Wind Energy Systems. In the presence of substantial movement costs, our algorithm consistently outperforms standard CBO algorithms.

**Abstract:** Neural network verification aims to provide provable bounds for the output of a neural network for a given input range. Notable prior works in this domain have either generated bounds using abstract domains, which preserve some dependency between intermediate neurons in the network; or framed verification as an optimization problem and solved a relaxation using Lagrangian methods. A key drawback of the latter technique is that each neuron is treated independently, thereby ignoring important neuron interactions. We provide an approach that merges these two threads and uses zonotopes within a Lagrangian decomposition. Crucially, we can decompose the problem of verifying a deep neural network into the verification of many 2-layer neural networks. While each of these problems is provably hard, we provide efficient relaxation methods that are amenable to efficient dual ascent procedures. Our technique yields bounds that improve upon both linear programming and Lagrangian-based verification techniques in both time and bound tightness.

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the most powerful tools for synthesizing complex robotic behaviors. But training DRL models is incredibly compute and memory intensive, requiring large training datasets and replay buffers to achieve performant results. This poses a challenge for the next generation of field robots that will need to learn on the edge to adapt to their environment. In this paper, we begin to address this issue through observation space quantization. We evaluate our approach using four simulated robot locomotion tasks and two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, the on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and find that observation space quantization reduces overall memory costs by as much as 4.2x without impacting learning performance.

**Abstract:** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition caused when patients' immune system mistakenly targets their own tissue. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to identify patterns in patient electronic health records (EHR) to forecast the best clinical treatment to improve patient outcomes. This study introduced a Drug Response Prediction (DRP) framework with two main goals: 1) design a data processing pipeline to extract information from tabular clinical data, and then preprocess it for functional use, and 2) predict RA patient's responses to drugs and evaluate classification models' performance. We propose a novel two-stage ML framework based on European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) criteria cutoffs to model drug effectiveness. Our model Stacked-Ensemble DRP was developed and cross-validated using data from 425 RA patients. The evaluation used a subset of 124 patients (30%) from the same data source. In the evaluation of the test set, two-stage DRP leads to improved classification accuracy over other end-to-end classification models for binary classification. Our proposed method provides a complete pipeline to predict disease activity scores and identify the group that does not respond well to anti-TNF treatments, thus showing promise in supporting clinical decisions based on EHR information.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection in large industrial cooling systems is very challenging due to the high data dimensionality, inconsistent sensor recordings, and lack of labels. The state of the art for automated anomaly detection in these systems typically relies on expert knowledge and thresholds. However, data is viewed isolated and complex, multivariate relationships are neglected. In this work, we present an autoencoder based end-to-end workflow for anomaly detection suitable for multivariate time series data in large industrial cooling systems, including explained fault localization and root cause analysis based on expert knowledge. We identify system failures using a threshold on the total reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error including all sensor signals). For fault localization, we compute the individual reconstruction error (autoencoder reconstruction error for each sensor signal) allowing us to identify the signals that contribute most to the total reconstruction error. Expert knowledge is provided via look-up table enabling root-cause analysis and assignment to the affected subsystem. We demonstrated our findings in a cooling system unit including 34 sensors over a 8-months time period using 4-fold cross validation approaches and automatically created labels based on thresholds provided by domain experts. Using 4-fold cross validation, we reached a F1-score of 0.56, whereas the autoencoder results showed a higher consistency score (CS of 0.92) compared to the automatically created labels (CS of 0.62) -- indicating that the anomaly is recognized in a very stable manner. The main anomaly was found by the autoencoder and automatically created labels and was also recorded in the log files. Further, the explained fault localization highlighted the most affected component for the main anomaly in a very consistent manner.

**Abstract:** Commonsense Knowledge Base (CSKB) Population aims at reasoning over unseen entities and assertions on CSKBs, and is an important yet hard commonsense reasoning task. One challenge is that it requires out-of-domain generalization ability as the source CSKB for training is of a relatively smaller scale (1M) while the whole candidate space for population is way larger (200M). We propose PseudoReasoner, a semi-supervised learning framework for CSKB population that uses a teacher model pre-trained on CSKBs to provide pseudo labels on the unlabeled candidate dataset for a student model to learn from. The teacher can be a generative model rather than restricted to discriminative models as previous works. In addition, we design a new filtering procedure for pseudo labels based on influence function and the student model's prediction to further improve the performance. The framework can improve the backbone model KG-BERT (RoBERTa-large) by 3.3 points on the overall performance and especially, 5.3 points on the out-of-domain performance, and achieves the state-of-the-art. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/PseudoReasoner.

**Abstract:** Minimum Description Length (MDL) provides a framework and an objective for principled model evaluation. It formalizes Occam's Razor and can be applied to data from non-stationary sources. In the prequential formulation of MDL, the objective is to minimize the cumulative next-step log-loss when sequentially going through the data and using previous observations for parameter estimation. It thus closely resembles a continual- or online-learning problem. In this study, we evaluate approaches for computing prequential description lengths for image classification datasets with neural networks. Considering the computational cost, we find that online-learning with rehearsal has favorable performance compared to the previously widely used block-wise estimation. We propose forward-calibration to better align the models predictions with the empirical observations and introduce replay-streams, a minibatch incremental training technique to efficiently implement approximate random replay while avoiding large in-memory replay buffers. As a result, we present description lengths for a suite of image classification datasets that improve upon previously reported results by large margins.

**Abstract:** As neural networks become more integrated into the systems that we depend on for transportation, medicine, and security, it becomes increasingly important that we develop methods to analyze their behavior to ensure that they are safe to use within these contexts. The methods used in this paper seek to certify safety for closed-loop systems with neural network controllers, i.e., neural feedback loops, using backward reachability analysis. Namely, we calculate backprojection (BP) set over-approximations (BPOAs), i.e., sets of states that lead to a given target set that bounds dangerous regions of the state space. The system's safety can then be certified by checking its current state against the BPOAs. While over-approximating BPs is significantly faster than calculating exact BP sets, solving the relaxed problem leads to conservativeness. To combat conservativeness, partitioning strategies can be used to split the problem into a set of sub-problems, each less conservative than the unpartitioned problem. We introduce a hybrid partitioning method that uses both target set partitioning (TSP) and backreachable set partitioning (BRSP) to overcome a lower bound on estimation error that is present when using BRSP. Numerical results demonstrate a near order-of-magnitude reduction in estimation error compared to BRSP or TSP given the same computation time.

**Abstract:** Robotics grasping refers to the task of making a robotic system pick an object by applying forces and torques on its surface. Despite the recent advances in data-driven approaches, grasping remains an unsolved problem. Most of the works on this task are relying on priors and heavy constraints to avoid the exploration problem. Novelty Search (NS) refers to evolutionary algorithms that replace selection of best performing individuals with selection of the most novel ones. Such methods have already shown promising results on hard exploration problems. In this work, we introduce a new NS-based method that can generate large datasets of grasping trajectories in a platform-agnostic manner. Inspired by the hierarchical learning paradigm, our method decouples approach and prehension to make the behavioral space smoother. Experiments conducted on 3 different robot-gripper setups and on several standard objects shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art for generating diverse repertoire of grasping trajectories, getting a higher successful run ratio, as well as a better diversity for both approach and prehension. Some of the generated solutions have been successfully deployed on a real robot, showing the exploitability of the obtained repertoires.

**Abstract:** In this work, we assess the ability of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve increasingly-complex coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We focus on a pair of benchmarks: discretized partial differential equations and harmonic oscillators, each of which has a tunable parameter that controls its complexity. Even by varying network architecture and applying a state-of-the-art training method that accounts for "difficult" training regions, we show that PINNs eventually fail to produce correct solutions to these benchmarks as their complexity -- the number of equations and the size of time domain -- increases. We identify several reasons why this may be the case, including insufficient network capacity, poor conditioning of the ODEs, and high local curvature, as measured by the Laplacian of the PINN loss.

**Abstract:** The act of reaching for an object is a fundamental yet complex skill for a robotic agent, requiring a high degree of visuomotor control and coordination. In consideration of dynamic environments, a robot capable of autonomously adapting to novel situations is desired. In this paper, a developmental robotics approach is used to autonomously learn visuomotor coordination on the NICO (Neuro-Inspired COmpanion) platform, for the task of object reaching. The robot interacts with its environment and learns associations between motor commands and temporally correlated sensory perceptions based on Hebbian learning. Multiple Grow-When-Required (GWR) networks are used to learn increasingly more complex motoric behaviors, by first learning how to direct the gaze towards a visual stimulus, followed by learning motor control of the arm, and finally learning how to reach for an object using eye-hand coordination. We demonstrate that the model is able to deal with an unforeseen mechanical change in the NICO's body, showing the adaptability of the proposed approach. In evaluations of our approach, we show that the humanoid robot NICO is able to reach objects with a 76% success rate.

**Abstract:** Deep learning for image super-resolution (SR) has been investigated by numerous researchers in recent years. Most of the works concentrate on effective block designs and improve the network representation but lack interpretation. There are also iterative optimization-inspired networks for image SR, which take the solution step as a whole without giving an explicit optimization step. This paper proposes an unfolding iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) inspired network for interpretable image SR. Specifically, we analyze the problem of image SR and propose a solution based on the ISTA method. Inspired by the mathematical analysis, the ISTA block is developed to conduct the optimization in an end-to-end manner. To make the exploration more effective, a multi-scale exploitation block and multi-scale attention mechanism are devised to build the ISTA block. Experimental results show the proposed ISTA-inspired restoration network (ISTAR) achieves competitive or better performances than other optimization-inspired works with fewer parameters and lower computation complexity.

<p>

**Abstract:** Algorithms for text-generation in dialogue can be misguided. For example, in task-oriented settings, reinforcement learning that optimizes only task-success can lead to abysmal lexical diversity. We hypothesize this is due to poor theoretical understanding of the objectives in text-generation and their relation to the learning process (i.e., model training). To this end, we propose a new theoretical framework for learning to generate text in dialogue. Compared to existing theories of learning, our framework allows for analysis of the multi-faceted goals inherent to text-generation. We use our framework to develop theoretical guarantees for learners that adapt to unseen data. As an example, we apply our theory to study data-shift within a cooperative learning algorithm proposed for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game. From this insight, we propose a new algorithm, and empirically, we demonstrate our proposal improves both task-success and human-likeness of the generated text. Finally, we show statistics from our theory are empirically predictive of multiple qualities of the generated dialogue, suggesting our theory is useful for model-selection when human evaluations are not available.

**Abstract:** Structured knowledge is important for many AI applications. Commonsense knowledge, which is crucial for robust human-centric AI, is covered by a small number of structured knowledge projects. However, they lack knowledge about human traits and behaviors conditioned on socio-cultural contexts, which is crucial for situative AI. This paper presents CANDLE, an end-to-end methodology for extracting high-quality cultural commonsense knowledge (CCSK) at scale. CANDLE extracts CCSK assertions from a huge web corpus and organizes them into coherent clusters, for 3 domains of subjects (geography, religion, occupation) and several cultural facets (food, drinks, clothing, traditions, rituals, behaviors). CANDLE includes judicious techniques for classification-based filtering and scoring of interestingness. Experimental evaluations show the superiority of the CANDLE CCSK collection over prior works, and an extrinsic use case demonstrates the benefits of CCSK for the GPT-3 language model.

**Abstract:** There has been a flurry of research in recent years on notions of fairness in ranking and recommender systems, particularly on how to evaluate if a recommender allocates exposure equally across groups of relevant items (also known as provider fairness). While this research has laid an important foundation, it gave rise to different approaches depending on whether relevant items are compared per-user/per-query or aggregated across users. Despite both being established and intuitive, we discover that these two notions can lead to opposite conclusions, a form of Simpson's Paradox. We reconcile these notions and show that the tension is due to differences in distributions of users where items are relevant, and break down the important factors of the user's recommendations. Based on this new understanding, practitioners might be interested in either notions, but might face challenges with the per-user metric due to partial observability of the relevance and user satisfaction, typical in real-world recommenders. We describe a technique based on distribution matching to estimate it in such a scenario. We demonstrate on simulated and real-world recommender data the effectiveness and usefulness of such an approach.

<p>

**Abstract:** Remote sensing images (RSIs) in real scenes may be disturbed by multiple factors such as optical blur, undersampling, and additional noise, resulting in complex and diverse degradation models. At present, the mainstream SR algorithms only consider a single and fixed degradation (such as bicubic interpolation) and cannot flexibly handle complex degradations in real scenes. Therefore, designing a super-resolution (SR) model that can cope with various degradations is gradually attracting the attention of researchers. Some studies first estimate the degradation kernels and then perform degradation-adaptive SR but face the problems of estimation error amplification and insufficient high-frequency details in the results. Although blind SR algorithms based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) have greatly improved visual quality, they still suffer from pseudo-texture, mode collapse, and poor training stability. In this article, we propose a novel blind SR framework based on the stochastic normalizing flow (BlindSRSNF) to address the above problems. BlindSRSNF learns the conditional probability distribution over the high-resolution image space given a low-resolution (LR) image by explicitly optimizing the variational bound on the likelihood. BlindSRSNF is easy to train and can generate photo-realistic SR results that outperform GAN-based models. Besides, we introduce a degradation representation strategy based on contrastive learning to avoid the error amplification problem caused by the explicit degradation estimation. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm can obtain SR results with excellent visual perception quality on both simulated LR and real-world RSIs.

**Abstract:** Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the analysis of cardiac function. However, the acquisition is often accompanied by motion artefacts because of the difficulty of breath-hold, especially for acute symptoms patients. Therefore, it is essential to assess the quality of cardiac MRI for further analysis. Time-consuming manual-based classification is not conducive to the construction of an end-to-end computer aided diagnostic system. To overcome this problem, an automatic cardiac MRI quality estimation framework using ensemble and transfer learning is proposed in this work. Multiple pre-trained models were initialised and fine-tuned on 2-dimensional image patches sampled from the training data. In the model inference process, decisions from these models are aggregated to make a final prediction. The framework has been evaluated on CMRxMotion grand challenge (MICCAI 2022) dataset which is small, multi-class, and imbalanced. It achieved a classification accuracy of 78.8% and 70.0% on the training set (5-fold cross-validation) and a validation set, respectively. The final trained model was also evaluated on an independent test set by the CMRxMotion organisers, which achieved the classification accuracy of 72.5% and Cohen's Kappa of 0.6309 (ranked top 1 in this grand challenge).

**Abstract:** Recent neural methods for vehicle routing problems always train and test the deep models on the same instance distribution (i.e., uniform). To tackle the consequent cross-distribution generalization concerns, we bring the knowledge distillation to this field and propose an Adaptive Multi-Distribution Knowledge Distillation (AMDKD) scheme for learning more generalizable deep models. Particularly, our AMDKD leverages various knowledge from multiple teachers trained on exemplar distributions to yield a light-weight yet generalist student model. Meanwhile, we equip AMDKD with an adaptive strategy that allows the student to concentrate on difficult distributions, so as to absorb hard-to-master knowledge more effectively. Extensive experimental results show that, compared with the baseline neural methods, our AMDKD is able to achieve competitive results on both unseen in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances, which are either randomly synthesized or adopted from benchmark datasets (i.e., TSPLIB and CVRPLIB). Notably, our AMDKD is generic, and consumes less computational resources for inference.

**Abstract:** Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which aims to find an optimal decision that minimizes the worst case cost over the ambiguity set of probability distribution, has been widely applied in diverse applications, e.g., network behavior analysis, risk management, etc. However, existing DRO techniques face three key challenges: 1) how to deal with the asynchronous updating in a distributed environment; 2) how to leverage the prior distribution effectively; 3) how to properly adjust the degree of robustness according to different scenarios. To this end, we propose an asynchronous distributed algorithm, named Asynchronous Single-looP alternatIve gRadient projEction (ASPIRE) algorithm with the itErative Active SEt method (EASE) to tackle the distributed distributionally robust optimization (DDRO) problem. Furthermore, a new uncertainty set, i.e., constrained D-norm uncertainty set, is developed to effectively leverage the prior distribution and flexibly control the degree of robustness. Finally, our theoretical analysis elucidates that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge and the iteration complexity is also analyzed. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can not only achieve fast convergence, and remain robust against data heterogeneity as well as malicious attacks, but also tradeoff robustness with performance.

<p>

**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pre-trained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pre-trained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting out the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different tasks of the GLUE benchmark using the RoBERTa model. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least $7\times$ faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.

**Abstract:** Safe reinforcement learning (RL) that solves constraint-satisfactory policies provides a promising way to the broader safety-critical applications of RL in real-world problems such as robotics. Among all safe RL approaches, model-based methods reduce training time violations further due to their high sample efficiency. However, lacking safety robustness against the model uncertainties remains an issue in safe model-based RL, especially in training time safety. In this paper, we propose a distributional reachability certificate (DRC) and its Bellman equation to address model uncertainties and characterize robust persistently safe states. Furthermore, we build a safe RL framework to resolve constraints required by the DRC and its corresponding shield policy. We also devise a line search method to maintain safety and reach higher returns simultaneously while leveraging the shield policy. Comprehensive experiments on classical benchmarks such as constrained tracking and navigation indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves comparable returns with much fewer constraint violations during training.

**Abstract:** Randomized experiments (a.k.a. A/B tests) are a powerful tool for estimating treatment effects, to inform decisions making in business, healthcare and other applications. In many problems, the treatment has a lasting effect that evolves over time. A limitation with randomized experiments is that they do not easily extend to measure long-term effects, since running long experiments is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we take a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that estimates the average reward in a Markov process. Motivated by real-world scenarios where the observed state transition is nonstationary, we develop a new algorithm for a class of nonstationary problems, and demonstrate promising results in two synthetic datasets and one online store dataset.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised mixture learning (UML) aims at identifying linearly or nonlinearly mixed latent components in a blind manner. UML is known to be challenging: Even learning linear mixtures requires highly nontrivial analytical tools, e.g., independent component analysis or nonnegative matrix factorization. In this work, the post-nonlinear (PNL) mixture model -- where unknown element-wise nonlinear functions are imposed onto a linear mixture -- is revisited. The PNL model is widely employed in different fields ranging from brain signal classification, speech separation, remote sensing, to causal discovery. To identify and remove the unknown nonlinear functions, existing works often assume different properties on the latent components (e.g., statistical independence or probability-simplex structures).
  This work shows that under a carefully designed UML criterion, the existence of a nontrivial null space associated with the underlying mixing system suffices to guarantee identification/removal of the unknown nonlinearity. Compared to prior works, our finding largely relaxes the conditions of attaining PNL identifiability, and thus may benefit applications where no strong structural information on the latent components is known. A finite-sample analysis is offered to characterize the performance of the proposed approach under realistic settings. To implement the proposed learning criterion, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. A series of numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical claims.

**Abstract:** In recent years, transformer-based language representation models (LRMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on difficult natural language understanding problems, such as question answering and text summarization. As these models are integrated into real-world applications, evaluating their ability to make rational decisions is an important research agenda, with practical ramifications. This article investigates LRMs' rational decision-making ability through a carefully designed set of decision-making benchmarks and experiments. Inspired by classic work in cognitive science, we model the decision-making problem as a bet. We then investigate an LRM's ability to choose outcomes that have optimal, or at minimum, positive expected gain. Through a robust body of experiments on four established LRMs, we show that a model is only able to `think in bets' if it is first fine-tuned on bet questions with an identical structure. Modifying the bet question's structure, while still retaining its fundamental characteristics, decreases an LRM's performance by more than 25\%, on average, although absolute performance remains well above random. LRMs are also found to be more rational when selecting outcomes with non-negative expected gain, rather than optimal or strictly positive expected gain. Our results suggest that LRMs could potentially be applied to tasks that rely on cognitive decision-making skills, but that more research is necessary before they can robustly make rational decisions.

**Abstract:** Convex Q-learning is a recent approach to reinforcement learning, motivated by the possibility of a firmer theory for convergence, and the possibility of making use of greater a priori knowledge regarding policy or value function structure. This paper explores algorithm design in the continuous time domain, with finite-horizon optimal control objective. The main contributions are (i) Algorithm design is based on a new Q-ODE, which defines the model-free characterization of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. (ii) The Q-ODE motivates a new formulation of Convex Q-learning that avoids the approximations appearing in prior work. The Bellman error used in the algorithm is defined by filtered measurements, which is beneficial in the presence of measurement noise. (iii) A characterization of boundedness of the constraint region is obtained through a non-trivial extension of recent results from the discrete time setting. (iv) The theory is illustrated in application to resource allocation for distributed energy resources, for which the theory is ideally suited.

**Abstract:** Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation (NERD) systems are foundational for information retrieval, question answering, event detection, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. We introduce TweetNERD, a dataset of 340K+ Tweets across 2010-2021, for benchmarking NERD systems on Tweets. This is the largest and most temporally diverse open sourced dataset benchmark for NERD on Tweets and can be used to facilitate research in this area. We describe evaluation setup with TweetNERD for three NERD tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Linking with True Spans (EL), and End to End Entity Linking (End2End); and provide performance of existing publicly available methods on specific TweetNERD splits.

**Abstract:** The Frank-Wolfe algorithm has regained much interest in its use in structurally constrained machine learning applications. However, one major limitation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is the slow local convergence property due to the zig-zagging behavior. We observe the zig-zagging phenomenon in the Frank-Wolfe method as an artifact of discretization, and propose multistep Frank-Wolfe variants where the truncation errors decay as $O(Œî^p)$, where $p$ is the method's order. This strategy "stabilizes" the method, and allows tools like line search and momentum to have more benefits. However, our results suggest that the worst case convergence rate of Runge-Kutta-type discretization schemes cannot improve upon that of the vanilla Frank-Wolfe method for a rate depending on $k$. Still, we believe that this analysis adds to the growing knowledge of flow analysis for optimization methods, and is a cautionary tale on the ultimate usefulness of multistep methods.

**Abstract:** Efficient energy consumption is crucial for achieving sustainable energy goals in the era of climate change and grid modernization. Thus, it is vital to understand how energy is consumed at finer resolutions such as household in order to plan demand-response events or analyze the impacts of weather, electricity prices, electric vehicles, solar, and occupancy schedules on energy consumption. However, availability and access to detailed energy-use data, which would enable detailed studies, has been rare. In this paper, we release a unique, large-scale, synthetic, residential energy-use dataset for the residential sector across the contiguous United States covering millions of households. The data comprise of hourly energy use profiles for synthetic households, disaggregated into Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL) and appliance use. The underlying framework is constructed using a bottom-up approach. Diverse open-source surveys and first principles models are used for end-use modeling. Extensive validation of the synthetic dataset has been conducted through comparisons with reported energy-use data. We present a detailed, open, high-resolution, residential energy-use dataset for the United States.

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel differentiable hybrid traffic simulator, which simulates traffic using a hybrid model of both macroscopic and microscopic models and can be directly integrated into a neural network for traffic control and flow optimization. This is the first differentiable traffic simulator for macroscopic and hybrid models that can compute gradients for traffic states across time steps and inhomogeneous lanes. To compute the gradient flow between two types of traffic models in a hybrid framework, we present a novel intermediate conversion component that bridges the lanes in a differentiable manner as well. We also show that we can use analytical gradients to accelerate the overall process and enhance scalability. Thanks to these gradients, our simulator can provide more efficient and scalable solutions for complex learning and control problems posed in traffic engineering than other existing algorithms.

**Abstract:** Movies are a great source of entertainment. However, the problem arises when one is trying to find the desired content within this vast amount of data which is significantly increasing every year. Recommender systems can provide appropriate algorithms to solve this problem. The content_based technique has found popularity due to the lack of available user data in most cases. Content_based recommender systems are based on the similarity of items' demographic information; Term Frequency _ Inverse Document Frequency (TF_IDF) and Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) are two approaches used to vectorize data to calculate these similarities. In this paper, we propose a weighted content_based movie RS by combining TF_IDF which is an appropriate approach for embedding textual data such as plot/description, and KGE which is used to embed named entities such as the director's name. The weights between features are determined using a Genetic algorithm. Additionally, the Iranian movies dataset is created by scraping data from movie_related websites. This dataset and the structure of the FarsBase KG are used to create the MovieFarsBase KG which is a component in the implementation process of the proposed content_based RS. Using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, this study shows that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach that uses TF_IDF for embedding all attributes.

**Abstract:** Malware affecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices is rapidly growing due to the relevance of this paradigm in real-world scenarios. Specialized literature has also detected a trend towards multi-purpose malware able to execute different malicious actions such as remote control, data leakage, encryption, or code hiding, among others. Protecting IoT devices against this kind of malware is challenging due to their well-known vulnerabilities and limitation in terms of CPU, memory, and storage. To improve it, the moving target defense (MTD) paradigm was proposed a decade ago and has shown promising results, but there is a lack of IoT MTD solutions dealing with multi-purpose malware. Thus, this work proposes four MTD mechanisms changing IoT devices' network, data, and runtime environment to mitigate multi-purpose malware. Furthermore, it presents a lightweight and IoT-oriented MTD framework to decide what, when, and how the MTD mechanisms are deployed. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the framework and MTD mechanisms are evaluated in a real-world scenario with one IoT spectrum sensor affected by multi-purpose malware.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) is a scheme for collaboratively training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with multiple data sources from different clients. Instead of sharing the data, each client trains the model locally, resulting in improved privacy. However, recently so-called targeted poisoning attacks have been proposed that allow individual clients to inject a backdoor into the trained model. Existing defenses against these backdoor attacks either rely on techniques like Differential Privacy to mitigate the backdoor, or analyze the weights of the individual models and apply outlier detection methods that restricts these defenses to certain data distributions. However, adding noise to the models' parameters or excluding benign outliers might also reduce the accuracy of the collaboratively trained model. Additionally, allowing the server to inspect the clients' models creates a privacy risk due to existing knowledge extraction methods.
  We propose \textit{CrowdGuard}, a model filtering defense, that mitigates backdoor attacks by leveraging the clients' data to analyze the individual models before the aggregation. To prevent data leaks, the server sends the individual models to secure enclaves, running in client-located Trusted Execution Environments. To effectively distinguish benign and poisoned models, even if the data of different clients are not independently and identically distributed (non-IID), we introduce a novel metric called \textit{HLBIM} to analyze the outputs of the DNN's hidden layers. We show that the applied significance-based detection algorithm combined can effectively detect poisoned models, even in non-IID scenarios.

**Abstract:** Differentiable neural architecture search (DARTS) is a popular method for neural architecture search (NAS), which performs cell-search and utilizes continuous relaxation to improve the search efficiency via gradient-based optimization. The main shortcoming of DARTS is performance collapse, where the discovered architecture suffers from a pattern of declining quality during search. Performance collapse has become an important topic of research, with many methods trying to solve the issue through either regularization or fundamental changes to DARTS. However, the weight-sharing framework used for cell-search in DARTS and the convergence of architecture parameters has not been analyzed yet. In this paper, we provide a thorough and novel theoretical and empirical analysis on DARTS and its point of convergence. We show that DARTS suffers from a specific structural flaw due to its weight-sharing framework that limits the convergence of DARTS to saturation points of the softmax function. This point of convergence gives an unfair advantage to layers closer to the output in choosing the optimal architecture, causing performance collapse. We then propose two new regularization terms that aim to prevent performance collapse by harmonizing operation selection via aligning gradients of layers. Experimental results on six different search spaces and three different datasets show that our method ($Œõ$-DARTS) does indeed prevent performance collapse, providing justification for our theoretical analysis and the proposed remedy.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose Dual Image and Video Transformer Architecture (DIViTA) for multi-label movie trailer genre classification. DIViTA performs an input adaption stage that uses shot detection to segment the trailer into highly correlated clips, providing a more cohesive input that allows to leverage pretrained ImageNet and/or Kinetics backbones. We introduce Trailers12k, a movie trailer dataset with manually verified title-trailer pairs, and present a transferability study of representations learned from ImageNet and Kinetics to Trailers12k. Our results show that DIViTA can reduce the gap between the spatio-temporal structure of the source and target datasets, thus improving transferability. Moreover, representations learned on either ImageNet or Kinetics are comparatively transferable to Trailers12k, although they provide complementary information that can be combined to improve classification performance. Interestingly, pretrained lightweight ConvNets provide competitive classification performance, while using a fraction of the computing resources compared to heavier ConvNets and Transformers.

**Abstract:** Decentralized optimization is an emerging paradigm in distributed learning in which agents achieve network-wide solutions by peer-to-peer communication without the central server. Since communication tends to be slower than computation, when each agent communicates with only a few neighboring agents per iteration, they can complete iterations faster than with more agents or a central server. However, the total number of iterations to reach a network-wide solution is affected by the speed at which the agents' information is ``mixed'' by communication. We found that popular communication topologies either have large maximum degrees (such as stars and complete graphs) or are ineffective at mixing information (such as rings and grids). To address this problem, we propose a new family of topologies, EquiTopo, which has an (almost) constant degree and a network-size-independent consensus rate that is used to measure the mixing efficiency.
  In the proposed family, EquiStatic has a degree of $Œò(\ln(n))$, where $n$ is the network size, and a series of time-dependent one-peer topologies, EquiDyn, has a constant degree of 1. We generate EquiDyn through a certain random sampling procedure. Both of them achieve an $n$-independent consensus rate. We apply them to decentralized SGD and decentralized gradient tracking and obtain faster communication and better convergence, theoretically and empirically. Our code is implemented through BlueFog and available at \url{https://github.com/kexinjinnn/EquiTopo}

**Abstract:** A graph $H$ is a clique graph if $H$ is a vertex-disjoin union of cliques. Abu-Khzam (2017) introduced the $(a,d)$-{Cluster Editing} problem, where for fixed natural numbers $a,d$, given a graph $G$ and vertex-weights $a^*:\ V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\dots, a\}$ and $d^*{}:\ V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,\dots, d\}$, we are to decide whether $G$ can be turned into a cluster graph by deleting at most $d^*(v)$ edges incident to every $v\in V(G)$ and adding at most $a^*(v)$ edges incident to every $v\in V(G)$. Results by Komusiewicz and Uhlmann (2012) and Abu-Khzam (2017) provided a dichotomy of complexity (in P or NP-complete) of $(a,d)$-{Cluster Editing} for all pairs $a,d$ apart from $a=d=1.$ Abu-Khzam (2017) conjectured that $(1,1)$-{Cluster Editing} is in P. We resolve Abu-Khzam's conjecture in affirmative by (i) providing a serious of five polynomial-time reductions to $C_3$-free and $C_4$-free graphs of maximum degree at most 3, and (ii) designing a polynomial-time algorithm for solving $(1,1)$-{Cluster Editing} on $C_3$-free and $C_4$-free graphs of maximum degree at most 3.
