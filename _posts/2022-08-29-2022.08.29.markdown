**Abstract:** Within the coming decades, artificial general intelligence (AGI) may surpass human capabilities at a wide range of important tasks. This report makes a case for why, without substantial action to prevent it, AGIs will likely use their intelligence to pursue goals which are very undesirable (in other words, misaligned) from a human perspective, with potentially catastrophic consequences. The report aims to cover the key arguments motivating concern about the alignment problem in a way that's as succinct, concrete and technically-grounded as possible. I argue that realistic training processes plausibly lead to the development of misaligned goals in AGIs, in particular because neural networks trained via reinforcement learning will learn to plan towards achieving a range of goals; gain more reward by deceptively pursuing misaligned goals; and generalize in ways which undermine obedience. As in an earlier report from Cotra (2022), I explain my claims with reference to an illustrative AGI training process, then outline possible research directions for addressing different aspects of the problem.

**Abstract:** While previous speech-driven talking face generation methods have made significant progress in improving the visual quality and lip-sync quality of the synthesized videos, they pay less attention to lip motion jitters which greatly undermine the realness of talking face videos. What causes motion jitters, and how to mitigate the problem? In this paper, we conduct systematic analyses on the motion jittering problem based on a state-of-the-art pipeline that uses 3D face representations to bridge the input audio and output video, and improve the motion stability with a series of effective designs. We find that several issues can lead to jitters in synthesized talking face video: 1) jitters from the input 3D face representations; 2) training-inference mismatch; 3) lack of dependency modeling among video frames. Accordingly, we propose three effective solutions to address this issue: 1) we propose a gaussian-based adaptive smoothing module to smooth the 3D face representations to eliminate jitters in the input; 2) we add augmented erosions on the input data of the neural renderer in training to simulate the distortion in inference to reduce mismatch; 3) we develop an audio-fused transformer generator to model dependency among video frames. Besides, considering there is no off-the-shelf metric for measuring motion jitters in talking face video, we devise an objective metric (Motion Stability Index, MSI), to quantitatively measure the motion jitters by calculating the reciprocal of variance acceleration. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method on motion-stable face video generation, with better quality than previous systems.

**Abstract:** Recent developments for Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) have shown the promise of leveraging unlabeled data to improve an object detector. However, thus far these methods have assumed that the unlabeled data does not contain out-of-distribution (OOD) classes, which is unrealistic with larger-scale unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we consider a more practical yet challenging problem, Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). We first find the existing SSOD method obtains a lower performance gain in open-set conditions, and this is caused by the semantic expansion, where the distracting OOD objects are mispredicted as in-distribution pseudo-labels for the semi-supervised training. To address this problem, we consider online and offline OOD detection modules, which are integrated with SSOD methods. With the extensive studies, we found that leveraging an offline OOD detector based on a self-supervised vision transformer performs favorably against online OOD detectors due to its robustness to the interference of pseudo-labeling. In the experiment, our proposed framework effectively addresses the semantic expansion issue and shows consistent improvements on many OSSOD benchmarks, including large-scale COCO-OpenImages. We also verify the effectiveness of our framework under different OSSOD conditions, including varying numbers of in-distribution classes, different degrees of supervision, and different combinations of unlabeled sets.

**Abstract:** Vision and Language Pretraining has become the prevalent approach for tackling multimodal downstream tasks. The current trend is to move towards ever larger models and pretraining datasets. This computational headlong rush does not seem reasonable in the long term to move toward sustainable solutions, and de facto excludes academic laboratories with limited resources. In this work, we propose a new framework, dubbed ViCHA, that efficiently exploits the input data to boost the learning by: (a) a new hierarchical cross-modal alignment loss, (b) new self-supervised scheme based on masked image modeling, (c) leveraging image-level annotations, called Visual Concepts, obtained with existing foundation models such as CLIP to boost the performance of the image encoder. Although pretrained on four times less data, our ViCHA strategy outperforms other approaches on several downstream tasks such as Image-Text Retrieval, VQA, Visual Reasoning, Visual Entailment and Visual Grounding. The code will be made publicly available here: https://github.com/mshukor/ViCHA

<p>

**Abstract:** Modern approaches for simulation-based inference rely upon deep learning surrogates to enable approximate inference with computer simulators. In practice, the estimated posteriors' computational faithfulness is, however, rarely guaranteed. For example, Hermans et al. (2021) show that current simulation-based inference algorithms can produce posteriors that are overconfident, hence risking false inferences. In this work, we introduce Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE), a variation of the NRE algorithm designed to produce posterior approximations that tend to be more conservative, hence improving their reliability, while sharing the same Bayes optimal solution. We achieve this by enforcing a balancing condition that increases the quantified uncertainty in small simulation budget regimes while still converging to the exact posterior as the budget increases. We provide theoretical arguments showing that BNRE tends to produce posterior surrogates that are more conservative than NRE's. We evaluate BNRE on a wide variety of tasks and show that it produces conservative posterior surrogates on all tested benchmarks and simulation budgets. Finally, we emphasize that BNRE is straightforward to implement over NRE and does not introduce any computational overhead.

<p>

**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have shown great potential for high-quality image synthesis. However, when it comes to producing images with complex scenes, how to properly describe both image global structures and object details remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present Frido, a Feature Pyramid Diffusion model performing a multi-scale coarse-to-fine denoising process for image synthesis. Our model decomposes an input image into scale-dependent vector quantized features, followed by a coarse-to-fine gating for producing image output. During the above multi-scale representation learning stage, additional input conditions like text, scene graph, or image layout can be further exploited. Thus, Frido can be also applied for conditional or cross-modality image synthesis. We conduct extensive experiments over various unconditioned and conditional image generation tasks, ranging from text-to-image synthesis, layout-to-image, scene-graph-to-image, to label-to-image. More specifically, we achieved state-of-the-art FID scores on five benchmarks, namely layout-to-image on COCO and OpenImages, scene-graph-to-image on COCO and Visual Genome, and label-to-image on COCO. Code is available at https://github.com/davidhalladay/Frido.

<p>

**Abstract:** We study a constructive algorithm that approximates Gateaux derivatives for statistical functionals by finite-differencing, with a focus on causal inference functionals. We consider the case where probability distributions are not known a priori but also need to be estimated from data. These estimated distributions lead to empirical Gateaux derivatives, and we study the relationships between empirical, numerical, and analytical Gateaux derivatives. Starting with a case study of estimating the mean potential outcome (hence average treatment effect), we instantiate the exact relationship between finite-differences and the analytical Gateaux derivative. We then derive requirements on the rates of numerical approximation in perturbation and smoothing that preserve the statistical benefits of one-step adjustments, such as rate-double-robustness. We then study more complicated functionals such as dynamic treatment regimes and the linear-programming formulation for policy optimization in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. The newfound ability to approximate bias adjustments in the presence of arbitrary constraints illustrates the usefulness of constructive approaches for Gateaux derivatives. We also find that the statistical structure of the functional (rate-double robustness) can permit less conservative rates of finite-difference approximation. This property, however, can be specific to particular functionals, e.g. it occurs for the mean potential outcome (hence average treatment effect) but not the infinite-horizon MDP policy value.

**Abstract:** Interpretability of deep learning is widely used to evaluate the reliability of medical imaging models and reduce the risks of inaccurate patient recommendations. For models exceeding human performance, e.g. predicting RNA structure from microscopy images, interpretable modelling can be further used to uncover highly non-trivial patterns which are otherwise imperceptible to the human eye. We show that interpretability can reveal connections between the microscopic appearance of cancer tissue and its gene expression profiling. While exhaustive profiling of all genes from the histology images is still challenging, we estimate the expression values of a well-known subset of genes that is indicative of cancer molecular subtype, survival, and treatment response in colorectal cancer. Our approach successfully identifies meaningful information from the image slides, highlighting hotspots of high gene expression. Our method can help characterise how gene expression shapes tissue morphology and this may be beneficial for patient stratification in the pathology unit. The code is available on GitHub.

**Abstract:** Ad relevance modeling plays a critical role in online advertising systems including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads, resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high, uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory inference speed with an acceptable accuracy.
  In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU, SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio of defective cold start ads with satisfactory real-time serving latency.

**Abstract:** Neural networks are powerful surrogates for numerous forward processes. The inversion of such surrogates is extremely valuable in science and engineering. The most important property of a successful neural inverse method is the performance of its solutions when deployed in the real world, i.e., on the native forward process (and not only the learned surrogate). We propose Autoinverse, a highly automated approach for inverting neural network surrogates. Our main insight is to seek inverse solutions in the vicinity of reliable data which have been sampled form the forward process and used for training the surrogate model. Autoinverse finds such solutions by taking into account the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate and minimizing it during the inversion. Apart from high accuracy, Autoinverse enforces the feasibility of solutions, comes with embedded regularization, and is initialization free. We verify our proposed method through addressing a set of real-world problems in control, fabrication, and design.

**Abstract:** To understand the security threats to reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, this paper studies poisoning attacks to manipulate \emph{any} order-optimal learning algorithm towards a targeted policy in episodic RL and examines the potential damage of two natural types of poisoning attacks, i.e., the manipulation of \emph{reward} and \emph{action}. We discover that the effect of attacks crucially depend on whether the rewards are bounded or unbounded. In bounded reward settings, we show that only reward manipulation or only action manipulation cannot guarantee a successful attack. However, by combining reward and action manipulation, the adversary can manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy with $\tildeŒò(\sqrt{T})$ total attack cost, which is order-optimal, without any knowledge of the underlying MDP. In contrast, in unbounded reward settings, we show that reward manipulation attacks are sufficient for an adversary to successfully manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ amount of contamination. Our results reveal useful insights about what can or cannot be achieved by poisoning attacks, and are set to spur more works on the design of robust RL algorithms.

**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) are shown to have commonsense knowledge of the physical world, which is fundamental for completing tasks in everyday situations. However, it is still an open question whether LMs have the ability to generate grounded, executable plans for embodied tasks. It is very challenging because LMs do not have an "eye" or "hand" to perceive the realistic environment. In this work, we show the first study on this important research question. We first present a novel problem formulation named G-PlanET, which takes as input a high-level goal and a table of objects in a specific environment. The expected output is a plan consisting of step-by-step instructions for agents to execute. To enable the study of this problem, we establish an evaluation protocol and devise a dedicated metric for assessing the quality of plans. In our extensive experiments, we show that adding flattened tables for encoding environments and using an iterative decoding strategy can both improve the LMs' ability for grounded planning. Our analysis of the results also leads to interesting non-trivial findings.

**Abstract:** Big data mining is well known to be an important task for data science, because it can provide useful observations and new knowledge hidden in given large datasets. Proximity-based data analysis is particularly utilized in many real-life applications. In such analysis, the distances to k nearest neighbors are usually employed, thus its main bottleneck is derived from data retrieval. Much efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of these analyses. However, they still incur large costs, because they essentially need many data accesses. To avoid this issue, we propose a machine-learning technique that quickly and accurately estimates the k-NN distances (i.e., distances to the k nearest neighbors) of a given query. We train a fully connected neural network model and utilize pivots to achieve accurate estimation. Our model is designed to have useful advantages: it infers distances to the k-NNs at a time, its inference time is O(1) (no data accesses are incurred), but it keeps high accuracy. Our experimental results and case studies on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.

<p>

**Abstract:** Exposure to bio-aerosols such as mold spores and pollen can lead to adverse health effects. There is a need for a portable and cost-effective device for long-term monitoring and quantification of various bio-aerosols. To address this need, we present a mobile and cost-effective label-free bio-aerosol sensor that takes holographic images of flowing particulate matter concentrated by a virtual impactor, which selectively slows down and guides particles larger than ~6 microns to fly through an imaging window. The flowing particles are illuminated by a pulsed laser diode, casting their inline holograms on a CMOS image sensor in a lens-free mobile imaging device. The illumination contains three short pulses with a negligible shift of the flowing particle within one pulse, and triplicate holograms of the same particle are recorded at a single frame before it exits the imaging field-of-view, revealing different perspectives of each particle. The particles within the virtual impactor are localized through a differential detection scheme, and a deep neural network classifies the aerosol type in a label-free manner, based on the acquired holographic images. We demonstrated the success of this mobile bio-aerosol detector with a virtual impactor using different types of pollen (i.e., bermuda, elm, oak, pine, sycamore, and wheat) and achieved a blind classification accuracy of 92.91%. This mobile and cost-effective device weighs ~700 g and can be used for label-free sensing and quantification of various bio-aerosols over extended periods since it is based on a cartridge-free virtual impactor that does not capture or immobilize particulate matter.

**Abstract:** Large Transformer models achieved the state-of-the-art status for Natural Language Understanding tasks and are increasingly becoming the baseline model architecture for modeling source code. Transformers are usually pre-trained on large unsupervised corpora, learning token representations and transformations relevant to modeling generally available text, and are then fine-tuned on a particular downstream task of interest. While fine-tuning is a tried-and-true method for adapting a model to a new domain -- for example, question-answering on a given topic -- generalization remains an on-going challenge. In this paper, we explore and evaluate transformer model fine-tuning for personalization. In the context of generating unit tests for Java methods, we evaluate learning to personalize to a specific software project using several personalization techniques. We consider three key approaches: (i) custom fine-tuning, which allows all the model parameters to be tuned; (ii) lightweight fine-tuning, which freezes most of the model's parameters, allowing tuning of the token embeddings and softmax layer only or the final layer alone; (iii) prefix tuning, which keeps model parameters frozen, but optimizes a small project-specific prefix vector. Each of these techniques offers a trade-off in total compute cost and predictive performance, which we evaluate by code and task-specific metrics, training time, and total computational operations. We compare these fine-tuning strategies for code generation and discuss the potential generalization and cost benefits of each in various deployment scenarios.

**Abstract:** Lossless image compression is an essential research field in image compression. Recently, learning-based image compression methods achieved impressive performance compared with traditional lossless methods, such as WebP, JPEG2000, and FLIF. However, there are still many impressive lossy compression methods that can be applied to lossless compression. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the methods widely used in lossy compression and apply them to lossless compression. Inspired by the impressive performance of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) shown in lossy compression, we generate a lossless network architecture with GMM. Besides noticing the successful achievements of attention modules and autoregressive models, we propose to utilize attention modules and add an extra autoregressive model for raw images in our network architecture to boost the performance. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms most classical lossless compression methods and existing learning-based methods.

**Abstract:** Garnets, known since the early stages of human civilization, have found important applications in modern technologies including magnetorestriction, spintronics, lithium batteries, etc. The overwhelming majority of experimentally known garnets are oxides, while explorations (experimental or theoretical) for the rest of the chemical space have been limited in scope. A key issue is that the garnet structure has a large primitive unit cell, requiring an enormous amount of computational resources. To perform a comprehensive search of the complete chemical space for new garnets,we combine recent progress in graph neural networks with high-throughput calculations. We apply the machine learning model to identify the potential (meta-)stable garnet systems before systematic density-functional calculations to validate the predictions. In this way, we discover more than 600 ternary garnets with distances to the convex hull below 100~meV/atom with a variety of physical and chemical properties. This includes sulfide, nitride and halide garnets. For these, we analyze the electronic structure and discuss the connection between the value of the electronic band gap and charge balance.

**Abstract:** Among the main features of biological intelligence are energy efficiency, capacity for continual adaptation, and risk management via uncertainty quantification. Neuromorphic engineering has been thus far mostly driven by the goal of implementing energy-efficient machines that take inspiration from the time-based computing paradigm of biological brains. In this paper, we take steps towards the design of neuromorphic systems that are capable of adaptation to changing learning tasks, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty quantification estimates. To this end, we derive online learning rules for spiking neural networks (SNNs) within a Bayesian continual learning framework. In it, each synaptic weight is represented by parameters that quantify the current epistemic uncertainty resulting from prior knowledge and observed data. The proposed online rules update the distribution parameters in a streaming fashion as data are observed. We instantiate the proposed approach for both real-valued and binary synaptic weights. Experimental results using Intel's Lava platform show the merits of Bayesian over frequentist learning in terms of capacity for adaptation and uncertainty quantification.

**Abstract:** Decentralized optimization with orthogonality constraints is found widely in scientific computing and data science. Since the orthogonality constraints are nonconvex, it is quite challenging to design efficient algorithms. Existing approaches leverage the geometric tools from Riemannian optimization to solve this problem at the cost of high sample and communication complexities. To relieve this difficulty, based on two novel techniques that can waive the orthogonality constraints, we propose a variance-reduced stochastic gradient tracking (VRSGT) algorithm with the convergence rate of $O(1 / k)$ to a stationary point. To the best of our knowledge, VRSGT is the first algorithm for decentralized optimization with orthogonality constraints that reduces both sampling and communication complexities simultaneously. In the numerical experiments, VRSGT has a promising performance in a real-world autonomous driving application.

**Abstract:** Text-to-image models have recently achieved remarkable success with seemingly accurate samples in photo-realistic quality. However as state-of-the-art language models still struggle evaluating precise statements consistently, so do language model based image generation processes. In this work we showcase problems of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like DALL-E with generating accurate samples from statements related to the draw bench benchmark. Furthermore we show that CLIP is not able to rerank those generated samples consistently. To this end we propose LogicRank, a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that can result in a more accurate ranking-system for such precision-demanding settings. LogicRank integrates smoothly into the generation process of text-to-image models and moreover can be used to further fine-tune towards a more logical precise model.

**Abstract:** Modern machine learning tasks often require considering not just one but multiple objectives. For example, besides the prediction quality, this could be the efficiency, robustness or fairness of the learned models, or any of their combinations. Multi-objective learning offers a natural framework for handling such problems without having to commit to early trade-offs. Surprisingly, statistical learning theory so far offers almost no insight into the generalization properties of multi-objective learning. In this work, we make first steps to fill this gap: we establish foundational generalization bounds for the multi-objective setting as well as generalization and excess bounds for learning with scalarizations. We also provide the first theoretical analysis of the relation between the Pareto-optimal sets of the true objectives and the Pareto-optimal sets of their empirical approximations from training data. In particular, we show a surprising asymmetry: all Pareto-optimal solutions can be approximated by empirically Pareto-optimal ones, but not vice versa.

**Abstract:** After the development of different machine learning and manifold learning algorithms, it may be a good time to put them together to make a powerful mind for machine. In this work, we propose affective manifolds as components of a machine's mind. Every affective manifold models a characteristic group of mind and contains multiple states. We define the machine's mind as a set of affective manifolds. We use a learning model for mapping the input signals to the embedding space of affective manifold. Using this mapping, a machine or a robot takes an input signal and can react emotionally to it. We use deep metric learning, with Siamese network, and propose a loss function for affective manifold learning. We define margins between states based on the psychological and philosophical studies. Using triplets of instances, we train the network to minimize the variance of every state and have the desired distances between states. We show that affective manifolds can have various applications for machine-machine and human-machine interactions. Some simulations are also provided for verification of the proposed method. It is possible to have as many affective manifolds as required in machine's mind. More affective manifolds in the machine's mind can make it more realistic and effective. This paper opens the door; we invite the researchers from various fields of science to propose more affective manifolds to be inserted in machine's mind.

**Abstract:** Learning-based visual ego-motion estimation is promising yet not ready for navigating agile mobile robots in the real world. In this article, we propose CUAHN-VIO, a robust and efficient monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) designed for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) equipped with a downward-facing camera. The vision frontend is a content-and-uncertainty-aware homography network (CUAHN) that is robust to non-homography image content and failure cases of network prediction. It not only predicts the homography transformation but also estimates its uncertainty. The training is self-supervised, so that it does not require ground truth that is often difficult to obtain. The network has good generalization that enables "plug-and-play" deployment in new environments without fine-tuning. A lightweight extended Kalman filter (EKF) serves as the VIO backend and utilizes the mean prediction and variance estimation from the network for visual measurement updates. CUAHN-VIO is evaluated on a high-speed public dataset and shows rivaling accuracy to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VIO approaches. Thanks to the robustness to motion blur, low network inference time (~23ms), and stable processing latency (~26ms), CUAHN-VIO successfully runs onboard an Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded processor to navigate a fast autonomous MAV.

**Abstract:** Today, creators of data-hungry deep neural networks (DNNs) scour the Internet for training fodder, leaving users with little control over or knowledge of when their data is appropriated for model training. To empower users to counteract unwanted data use, we design, implement and evaluate a practical system that enables users to detect if their data was used to train an DNN model. We show how users can create special data points we call isotopes, which introduce "spurious features" into DNNs during training. With only query access to a trained model and no knowledge of the model training process, or control of the data labels, a user can apply statistical hypothesis testing to detect if a model has learned the spurious features associated with their isotopes by training on the user's data. This effectively turns DNNs' vulnerability to memorization and spurious correlations into a tool for data provenance. Our results confirm efficacy in multiple settings, detecting and distinguishing between hundreds of isotopes with high accuracy. We further show that our system works on public ML-as-a-service platforms and larger models such as ImageNet, can use physical objects instead of digital marks, and remains generally robust against several adaptive countermeasures.

**Abstract:** CBCTs in image-guided radiotherapy provide crucial anatomy information for patient setup and plan evaluation. Longitudinal CBCT image registration could quantify the inter-fractional anatomic changes. The purpose of this study is to propose an unsupervised deep learning based CBCT-CBCT deformable image registration. The proposed deformable registration workflow consists of training and inference stages that share the same feed-forward path through a spatial transformation-based network (STN). The STN consists of a global generative adversarial network (GlobalGAN) and a local GAN (LocalGAN) to predict the coarse- and fine-scale motions, respectively. The network was trained by minimizing the image similarity loss and the deformable vector field (DVF) regularization loss without the supervision of ground truth DVFs. During the inference stage, patches of local DVF were predicted by the trained LocalGAN and fused to form a whole-image DVF. The local whole-image DVF was subsequently combined with the GlobalGAN generated DVF to obtain final DVF. The proposed method was evaluated using 100 fractional CBCTs from 20 abdominal cancer patients in the experiments and 105 fractional CBCTs from a cohort of 21 different abdominal cancer patients in a holdout test. Qualitatively, the registration results show great alignment between the deformed CBCT images and the target CBCT image. Quantitatively, the average target registration error (TRE) calculated on the fiducial markers and manually identified landmarks was 1.91+-1.11 mm. The average mean absolute error (MAE), normalized cross correlation (NCC) between the deformed CBCT and target CBCT were 33.42+-7.48 HU, 0.94+-0.04, respectively. This promising registration method could provide fast and accurate longitudinal CBCT alignment to facilitate inter-fractional anatomic changes analysis and prediction.

**Abstract:** Prostate cancer was the third most common cancer in 2020 internationally, coming after breast cancer and lung cancer. Furthermore, in recent years prostate cancer has shown an increasing trend. According to clinical experience, if this problem is detected and treated early, there can be a high chance of survival for the patient. One task that helps diagnose prostate cancer is prostate segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging. Manual segmentation performed by clinical experts has its drawbacks such as: the high time and concentration required from observers; and inter- and intra-observer variability. This is why in recent years automatic approaches to segment a prostate based on convolutional neural networks have emerged. Many of them have novel proposed architectures. In this paper I make an exhaustive study of several deep learning models by adjusting them to the task of prostate prediction. I do not use novel architectures, but focus my work more on how to train the networks. My approach is based on a ResNext101 3D encoder and a Unet3D decoder. I provide a study of the importance of resolutions in resampling data, something that no one else has done before.

**Abstract:** This paper describes a new approach for learning structures of large Bayesian networks based on blocks resulting from feature space clustering. This clustering is obtained using normalized mutual information. And the subsequent aggregation of blocks is done using classical learning methods except that they are input with compressed information about combinations of feature values for each block. Validation of this approach is done for Hill-Climbing as a graph enumeration algorithm for two score functions: BIC and MI. In this way, potentially parallelizable block learning can be implemented even for those score functions that are considered unsuitable for parallelizable learning. The advantage of the approach is evaluated in terms of speed of work as well as the accuracy of the found structures.

**Abstract:** Deep neural network, despite its remarkable capability of discriminating targeted in-distribution samples, shows poor performance on detecting anomalous out-of-distribution data. To address this defect, state-of-the-art solutions choose to train deep networks on an auxiliary dataset of outliers. Various training criteria for these auxiliary outliers are proposed based on heuristic intuitions. However, we find that these intuitively designed outlier training criteria can hurt in-distribution learning and eventually lead to inferior performance. To this end, we identify three causes of the in-distribution incompatibility: contradictory gradient, false likelihood, and distribution shift. Based on our new understandings, we propose a new out-of-distribution detection method by adapting both the top-design of deep models and the loss function. Our method achieves in-distribution compatibility by pursuing less interference with the probabilistic characteristic of in-distribution features. On several benchmarks, our method not only achieves the state-of-the-art out-of-distribution detection performance but also improves the in-distribution accuracy.

**Abstract:** The availability of large scale data with high quality ground truth labels is a challenge when developing supervised machine learning solutions for healthcare domain. Although, the amount of digital data in clinical workflows is increasing, most of this data is distributed on clinical sites and protected to ensure patient privacy. Radiological readings and dealing with large-scale clinical data puts a significant burden on the available resources, and this is where machine learning and artificial intelligence play a pivotal role. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for musculoskeletal (MSK) diagnosis is one example where the scans have a wealth of information, but require a significant amount of time for reading and labeling. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be a solution for handling the lack of availability of ground truth labels, but generally requires a large amount of training data during the pretraining stage. Herein, we propose a slice-based self-supervised deep learning framework (SB-SSL), a novel slice-based paradigm for classifying abnormality using knee MRI scans. We show that for a limited number of cases (<1000), our proposed framework is capable to identify anterior cruciate ligament tear with an accuracy of 89.17% and an AUC of 0.954, outperforming state-of-the-art without usage of external data during pretraining. This demonstrates that our proposed framework is suited for SSL in the limited data regime.

**Abstract:** We propose a dynamic network sampling scheme to optimize block recovery for stochastic blockmodel (SBM) in the case where it is prohibitively expensive to observe the entire graph. Theoretically, we provide justification of our proposed Chernoff-optimal dynamic sampling scheme via the Chernoff information. Practically, we evaluate the performance, in terms of block recovery, of our method on several real datasets from different domains. Both theoretically and practically results suggest that our method can identify vertices that have the most impact on block structure so that one can only check whether there are edges between them to save significant resources but still recover the block structure.

**Abstract:** Adversarial training instances can severely distort a model's behavior. This work investigates certified regression defenses, which provide guaranteed limits on how much a regressor's prediction may change under a training-set attack. Our key insight is that certified regression reduces to certified classification when using median as a model's primary decision function. Coupling our reduction with existing certified classifiers, we propose six new provably-robust regressors. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first work that certifies the robustness of individual regression predictions without any assumptions about the data distribution and model architecture. We also show that existing state-of-the-art certified classifiers often make overly-pessimistic assumptions that can degrade their provable guarantees. We introduce a tighter analysis of model robustness, which in many cases results in significantly improved certified guarantees. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate our approaches' effectiveness on both regression and classification data, where the accuracy of up to 50% of test predictions can be guaranteed under 1% training-set corruption and up to 30% of predictions under 4% corruption.

**Abstract:** We prove that natural gradient descent, with respect to the parameters of a machine learning policy, admits a conjugate dynamical description consistent with evolution by natural selection. We characterize these conjugate dynamics as a locally optimal fit to the continuous-time replicator dynamics, and show that the Price equation applies to equivalence classes of functions belonging to a Hilbert space generated by the policy's architecture and parameters. We posit that "conjugate natural selection" intuitively explains the empirical effectiveness of natural gradient descent, while developing a useful analytic approach to the dynamics of machine learning.

**Abstract:** Strong gravitational lensing has emerged as a promising approach for probing dark matter models on sub-galactic scales. Recent work has proposed the subhalo effective density slope as a more reliable observable than the commonly used subhalo mass function. The subhalo effective density slope is a measurement independent of assumptions about the underlying density profile and can be inferred for individual subhalos through traditional sampling methods. To go beyond individual subhalo measurements, we leverage recent advances in machine learning and introduce a neural likelihood-ratio estimator to infer an effective density slope for populations of subhalos. We demonstrate that our method is capable of harnessing the statistical power of multiple subhalos (within and across multiple images) to distinguish between characteristics of different subhalo populations. The computational efficiency warranted by the neural likelihood-ratio estimator over traditional sampling enables statistical studies of dark matter perturbers and is particularly useful as we expect an influx of strong lensing systems from upcoming surveys.

**Abstract:** Multi-view learning has progressed rapidly in recent years. Although many previous studies assume that each instance appears in all views, it is common in real-world applications for instances to be missing from some views, resulting in incomplete multi-view data. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Latent Heterogeneous Graph Network (LHGN) for incomplete multi-view learning, which aims to use multiple incomplete views as fully as possible in a flexible manner. By learning a unified latent representation, a trade-off between consistency and complementarity among different views is implicitly realized. To explore the complex relationship between samples and latent representations, a neighborhood constraint and a view-existence constraint are proposed, for the first time, to construct a heterogeneous graph. Finally, to avoid any inconsistencies between training and test phase, a transductive learning technique is applied based on graph learning for classification tasks. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** Many object detection models struggle with several problematic aspects of small object detection including the low number of samples, lack of diversity and low features representation. Taking into account that GANs belong to generative models class, their initial objective is to learn to mimic any data distribution. Using the proper GAN model would enable augmenting low precision data increasing their amount and diversity. This solution could potentially result in improved object detection results. Additionally, incorporating GAN-based architecture inside deep learning model can increase accuracy of small objects recognition. In this work the GAN-based method with augmentation is presented to improve small object detection on VOC Pascal dataset. The method is compared with different popular augmentation strategies like object rotations, shifts etc. The experiments are based on FasterRCNN model.

**Abstract:** To improve the security and reliability of wind energy production, short-term forecasting has become of utmost importance. This study focuses on multi-step spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting for the Norwegian continental shelf. A graph neural network (GNN) architecture was used to extract spatial dependencies, with different update functions to learn temporal correlations. These update functions were implemented using different neural network architectures. One such architecture, the Transformer, has become increasingly popular for sequence modelling in recent years. Various alterations of the original architecture have been proposed to better facilitate time-series forecasting, of which this study focused on the Informer, LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer. This is the first time the LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer have been applied to wind forecasting and the first time any of these or the Informer have been formulated in a spatio-temporal setting for wind forecasting. By comparing against spatio-temporal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, the study showed that the models using the altered Transformer architectures as update functions in GNNs were able to outperform these. Furthermore, we propose the Fast Fourier Transformer (FFTransformer), which is a novel Transformer architecture based on signal decomposition and consists of two separate streams that analyse trend and periodic components separately. The FFTransformer and Autoformer were found to achieve superior results for the 10-minute and 1-hour ahead forecasts, with the FFTransformer significantly outperforming all other models for the 4-hour ahead forecasts. Finally, by varying the degree of connectivity for the graph representations, the study explicitly demonstrates how all models were able to leverage spatial dependencies to improve local short-term wind speed forecasting.

**Abstract:** Satellite images constitute a highly valuable and abundant resource for many real world applications. However, the labeled data needed to train most machine learning models are scarce and difficult to obtain. In this context, the current work investigates a fully unsupervised methodology that, given a temporal sequence of satellite images, creates a partition of the ground according to its semantic properties and their evolution over time. The sequences of images are translated into a grid of multivariate time series of embedded tiles. The embedding and the partitional clustering of these sequences of tiles are constructed in two iterative steps: In the first step, the embedding is able to extract the information of the sequences of tiles based on a geographical neighborhood, and the tiles are grouped into clusters. In the second step, the embedding is refined by using the neighborhood defined by the clusters, and the final clustering of the sequences of tiles is obtained. We illustrate the methodology by conducting the semantic clustering of a sequence of 20 satellite images of the region of Navarra (Spain). The results show that the clustering of multivariate time series is robust and contains trustful spatio-temporal semantic information about the region under study. We unveil the close connection that exists between the geographic and embedded spaces, and find out that the semantic properties attributed to these kinds of embeddings are fully exploited and even enhanced by the proposed clustering of time series.

**Abstract:** In malignant primary brain tumors, cancer cells infiltrate into the peritumoral brain structures which results in inevitable recurrence. Quantitative assessment of infiltrative heterogeneity in the peritumoral region, the area where biopsy or resection can be hazardous, is important for clinical decision making. Previous work on characterizing the infiltrative heterogeneity in the peritumoral region used various imaging modalities, but information of extracellular free water movement restriction has been limitedly explored. Here, we derive a unique set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based markers capturing the heterogeneity of tumor infiltration, by characterizing free water movement restriction in the peritumoral region using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)-based free water volume fraction maps. A novel voxel-wise deep learning-based peritumoral microenvironment index (PMI) is first extracted by leveraging the widely different water diffusivity properties of glioblastomas and brain metastases as regions with and without infiltrations in the peritumoral tissue. Descriptive characteristics of locoregional hubs of uniformly high PMI values are extracted as AI-based markers to capture distinct aspects of infiltrative heterogeneity. The proposed markers are applied to two clinical use cases on an independent population of 275 adult-type diffuse gliomas (CNS WHO grade 4), analyzing the duration of survival among Isocitrate-Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-wildtypes and the differences with IDH1-mutants. Our findings provide a panel of markers as surrogates of infiltration that captures unique insight about underlying biology of peritumoral microstructural heterogeneity, establishing them as biomarkers of prognosis pertaining to survival and molecular stratification, with potential applicability in clinical decision making.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a new neural architectural block for the vision domain, named Mixing Regionally and Locally (MRL), developed with the aim of effectively and efficiently mixing the provided input features. We bifurcate the input feature mixing task as mixing at a regional and local scale. To achieve an efficient mix, we exploit the domain-wide receptive field provided by self-attention for regional-scale mixing and convolutional kernels restricted to local scale for local-scale mixing. More specifically, our proposed method mixes regional features associated with local features within a defined region, followed by a local-scale features mix augmented by regional features. Experiments show that this hybridization of self-attention and convolution brings improved capacity, generalization (right inductive bias), and efficiency. Under similar network settings, MRL outperforms or is at par with its counterparts in classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. We also show that our MRL-based network architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for H&E histology datasets. We achieved DICE of 0.843, 0.855, and 0.892 for Kumar, CoNSep, and CPM-17 datasets, respectively, while highlighting the versatility offered by the MRL framework by incorporating layers like group convolutions to improve dataset-specific generalization.

**Abstract:** While sample efficiency is the main motive for use of Bayesian optimisation when black-box functions are expensive to evaluate, the standard approach based on type II maximum likelihood (ML-II) may fail and result in disappointing performance in small-sample trials. The paper provides three compelling reasons to adopt fully Bayesian optimisation (FBO) as an alternative. First, failures of ML-II are more commonplace than implied by the existing studies using the contrived settings. Second, FBO is more robust than ML-II, and the price of robustness is almost trivial. Third, FBO has become simple to implement and fast enough to be practical. The paper supports the argument using relevant experiments, which reflect the current practice regarding models, algorithms, and software platforms. Since the benefits seem to outweigh the costs, researchers should consider adopting FBO for their applications so that they can guard against potential failures that end up wasting precious research resources.

<p>

**Abstract:** The Frank-Wolfe method has become increasingly useful in statistical and machine learning applications, due to the structure-inducing properties of the iterates, and especially in settings where linear minimization over the feasible set is more computationally efficient than projection. In the setting of Empirical Risk Minimization -- one of the fundamental optimization problems in statistical and machine learning -- the computational effectiveness of Frank-Wolfe methods typically grows linearly in the number of data observations $n$. This is in stark contrast to the case for typical stochastic projection methods. In order to reduce this dependence on $n$, we look to second-order smoothness of typical smooth loss functions (least squares loss and logistic loss, for example) and we propose amending the Frank-Wolfe method with Taylor series-approximated gradients, including variants for both deterministic and stochastic settings. Compared with current state-of-the-art methods in the regime where the optimality tolerance $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small, our methods are able to simultaneously reduce the dependence on large $n$ while obtaining optimal convergence rates of Frank-Wolfe methods, in both the convex and non-convex settings. We also propose a novel adaptive step-size approach for which we have computational guarantees. Last of all, we present computational experiments which show that our methods exhibit very significant speed-ups over existing methods on real-world datasets for both convex and non-convex binary classification problems.

**Abstract:** Bilinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in many different domains and they can also be used to approximate more general control-affine systems. This motivates the problem of learning bilinear systems from a single trajectory of the system's states and inputs. Under a mild marginal mean-square stability assumption, we identify how much data is needed to estimate the unknown bilinear system up to a desired accuracy with high probability. Our sample complexity and statistical error rates are optimal in terms of the trajectory length, the dimensionality of the system and the input size. Our proof technique relies on an application of martingale small-ball condition. This enables us to correctly capture the properties of the problem, specifically our error rates do not deteriorate with increasing instability. Finally, we show that numerical experiments are well-aligned with our theoretical results.

**Abstract:** Debiasing word embeddings has been largely limited to individual and independent social categories. However, real-world corpora typically present multiple social categories that possibly correlate or intersect with each other. For instance, "hair weaves" is stereotypically associated with African American females, but neither African American nor females alone. Therefore, this work studies biases associated with multiple social categories: joint biases induced by the union of different categories and intersectional biases that do not overlap with the biases of the constituent categories. We first empirically observe that individual biases intersect non-trivially (i.e., over a one-dimensional subspace). Drawing from the intersectional theory in social science and the linguistic theory, we then construct an intersectional subspace to debias for multiple social categories using the nonlinear geometry of individual biases. Empirical evaluations corroborate the efficacy of our approach. Data and implementation code can be downloaded at https://github.com/GitHubLuCheng/Implementation-of-JoSEC-COLING-22.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an autonomous agent learns to make an optimal sequence of decisions by interacting with the underlying environment. The promise demonstrated by RL-guided workflows in unraveling electronic design automation problems has encouraged hardware security researchers to utilize autonomous RL agents in solving domain-specific problems. From the perspective of hardware security, such autonomous agents are appealing as they can generate optimal actions in an unknown adversarial environment. On the other hand, the continued globalization of the integrated circuit supply chain has forced chip fabrication to off-shore, untrustworthy entities, leading to increased concerns about the security of the hardware. Furthermore, the unknown adversarial environment and increasing design complexity make it challenging for defenders to detect subtle modifications made by attackers (a.k.a. hardware Trojans). In this brief, we outline the development of RL agents in detecting hardware Trojans, one of the most challenging hardware security problems. Additionally, we outline potential opportunities and enlist the challenges of applying RL to solve hardware security problems.

**Abstract:** This paper presents an approach to assess the perfusion of visible human tissue from RGB video files. We propose metrics derived from remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals to detect whether a tissue is adequately supplied with blood. The perfusion analysis is done in three different scales, offering a flexible approach for different applications. We perform a plane-orthogonal-to-skin rPPG independently for locally defined regions of interest on each scale. From the extracted signals, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio, magnitude in the frequency domain, heart rate, perfusion index as well as correlation between specific rPPG signals in order to locally assess the perfusion of a specific region of human tissue. We show that locally resolved rPPG has a broad range of applications. As exemplary applications, we present results in intraoperative perfusion analysis and visualization during skin and organ transplantation as well as an application for liveliness assessment for the detection of presentation attacks to authentication systems.

**Abstract:** Hate speech classification has been a long-standing problem in natural language processing. However, even though there are numerous hate speech detection methods, they usually overlook a lot of hateful statements due to them being implicit in nature. Developing datasets to aid in the task of implicit hate speech classification comes with its own challenges; difficulties are nuances in language, varying definitions of what constitutes hate speech, and the labor-intensive process of annotating such data. This had led to a scarcity of data available to train and test such systems, which gives rise to high variance problems when parameter-heavy transformer-based models are used to address the problem. In this paper, we explore various optimization and regularization techniques and develop a novel RoBERTa-based model that achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Lateral Movement refers to methods by which threat actors gain initial access to a network and then progressively move through said network collecting key data about assets until they reach the ultimate target of their attack. Lateral Movement intrusions have become more intricate with the increasing complexity and interconnected nature of enterprise networks, and require equally sophisticated detection mechanisms to proactively detect such threats in near real-time at enterprise scale. In this paper, the authors propose a novel, lightweight method for Lateral Movement detection using user behavioral analysis and machine learning. Specifically, this paper introduces a novel methodology for cyber domain-specific feature engineering that identifies Lateral Movement behavior on a per-user basis. Furthermore, the engineered features have also been used to develop two supervised machine learning models for Lateral Movement identification that have demonstrably outperformed models previously seen in literature while maintaining robust performance on datasets with high class imbalance. The models and methodology introduced in this paper have also been designed in collaboration with security operators to be relevant and interpretable in order to maximize impact and minimize time to value as a cyber threat detection toolkit. The underlying goal of the paper is to provide a computationally efficient, domain-specific approach to near real-time Lateral Movement detection that is interpretable and robust to enterprise-scale data volumes and class imbalance.

**Abstract:** Skip connections are fundamental units in encoder-decoder networks, which are able to improve the feature propagtion of the neural networks. However, most methods with skip connections just connected features with the same resolution in the encoder and the decoder, which ignored the information loss in the encoder with the layers going deeper. To leverage the information loss of the features in shallower layers of the encoder, we propose a full skip connection network (FSCN) for monocular depth estimation task. In addition, to fuse features within skip connections more closely, we present an adaptive concatenation module (ACM). Further more, we conduct extensive experiments on the ourdoor and indoor datasets (i.e., the KITTI dataste and the NYU Depth V2 dataset) for FSCN and FSCN gets the state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** Since multidrug combination is widely applied, the accurate prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI) is becoming more and more critical. In our method, we use graph to represent drug-drug interaction: nodes represent drug; edges represent drug-drug interactions. Based on our assumption, we convert the prediction of DDI to link prediction problem, utilizing known drug node characteristics and DDI types to predict unknown DDI types. This work proposes a Graph Distance Neural Network (GDNN) to predict drug-drug interactions. Firstly, GDNN generates initial features for nodes via target point method, fully including the distance information in the graph. Secondly, GDNN adopts an improved message passing framework to better generate each drug node embedded expression, comprehensively considering the nodes and edges characteristics synchronously. Thirdly, GDNN aggregates the embedded expressions, undergoing MLP processing to generate the final predicted drug interaction type. GDNN achieved Test Hits@20=0.9037 on the ogb-ddi dataset, proving GDNN can predict DDI efficiently.

**Abstract:** We revisit the classical kernel method of approximation/interpolation theory in a very specific context motivated by the desire to obtain a robust procedure to approximate discrete data sets by (super)level sets of functions that are merely continuous at the data set arguments but are otherwise smooth. Special functions, called data signals, are defined for any given data set and are used to succesfully solve supervised classification problems in a robust way that depends continuously on the data set. The efficacy of the method is illustrated with a series of low dimensional examples and by its application to the standard benchmark high dimensional problem of MNIST digit classification.

**Abstract:** First Rosenblatt's theorem about omnipotence of shallow networks states that elementary perceptrons can solve any classification problem if there are no discrepancies in the training set. Minsky and Papert considered elementary perceptrons with restrictions on the neural inputs: a bounded number of connections or a relatively small diameter of the receptive field for each neuron at the hidden layer. They proved that under these constraints, an elementary perceptron cannot solve some problems, such as the connectivity of input images or the parity of pixels in them. In this note, we demonstrated first Rosenblatt's theorem at work, showed how an elementary perceptron can solve a version of the travel maze problem, and analysed the complexity of that solution. We constructed also a deep network algorithm for the same problem. It is much more efficient. The shallow network uses an exponentially large number of neurons on the hidden layer (Rosenblatt's $A$-elements), whereas for the deep network the second order polynomial complexity is sufficient. We demonstrated that for the same complex problem deep network can be much smaller and reveal a heuristic behind this effect.

**Abstract:** The lung airway tree modeling is essential to work for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases, especially for X-Ray computed tomography (CT). The airway tree modeling on CT images can provide the experts with 3-dimension measurements like wall thickness, etc. This information can tremendously aid the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1-4]. Many scholars have attempted various ways to model the lung airway tree, which can be split into two major categories based on its nature. Namely, the model-based approach and the deep learning approach. The performance of a typical model-based approach usually depends on the manual tuning of the model parameter, which can be its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is its don't require a large amount of training data which can be beneficial for a small dataset like medical imaging. On the other hand, the performance of model-based may be a misconcep-tion [5,6].
  In recent years, deep learning has achieved good results in the field of medical image processing, and many scholars have used UNet-based methods in medical image segmentation [7-11]. Among all the variation of UNet, the UNet 3+ [11] have relatively good result compare to the rest of the variation of UNet. Therefor to further improve the accuracy of lung airway tree modeling, this study combines the Frangi filter [5] with UNet 3+ [11] to develop a dual-channel 3D UNet 3+. The Frangi filter is used to extracting vessel-like feature. The vessel-like feature then used as input to guide the dual-channel UNet 3+ training and testing procedures.

**Abstract:** This paper is a survey of methods for solving smooth (strongly) monotone stochastic variational inequalities. To begin with, we give the deterministic foundation from which the stochastic methods eventually evolved. Then we review methods for the general stochastic formulation, and look at the finite sum setup. The last parts of the paper are devoted to various recent (not necessarily stochastic) advances in algorithms for variational inequalities.
