**Abstract:** When dealing with a series of imminent issues, humans can naturally concentrate on a subset of these concerning issues by prioritizing them according to their contributions to motivational indices, e.g., the probability of winning a game. This idea of concentration offers insights into reinforcement learning of sophisticated Large-scale Multi-Agent Systems (LMAS) participated by hundreds of agents. In such an LMAS, each agent receives a long series of entity observations at each step, which can overwhelm existing aggregation networks such as graph attention networks and cause inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a concentration network called ConcNet. First, ConcNet scores the observed entities considering several motivational indices, e.g., expected survival time and state value of the agents, and then ranks, prunes, and aggregates the encodings of observed entities to extract features. Second, distinct from the well-known attention mechanism, ConcNet has a unique motivational subnetwork to explicitly consider the motivational indices when scoring the observed entities. Furthermore, we present a concentration policy gradient architecture that can learn effective policies in LMAS from scratch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented architecture has excellent scalability and flexibility, and significantly outperforms existing methods on LMAS benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Universal Lesion Detection (ULD) in computed tomography plays an essential role in computer-aided diagnosis. Promising ULD results have been reported by multi-slice-input detection approaches which model 3D context from multiple adjacent CT slices, but such methods still experience difficulty in obtaining a global representation among different slices and within each individual slice since they only use convolution-based fusion operations. In this paper, we propose a novel Slice Attention Transformer (SATr) block which can be easily plugged into convolution-based ULD backbones to form hybrid network structures. Such newly formed hybrid backbones can better model long-distance feature dependency via the cascaded self-attention modules in the Transformer block while still holding a strong power of modeling local features with the convolutional operations in the original backbone. Experiments with five state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed SATr block can provide an almost free boost to lesion detection accuracy without extra hyperparameters or special network designs.

**Abstract:** Thanks to the diffusion of the Internet of Things, nowadays it is possible to sense human mobility almost in real time using unconventional methods (e.g., number of bikes in a bike station). Due to the diffusion of such technologies, the last years have witnessed a significant growth of human mobility studies, motivated by their importance in a wide range of applications, from traffic management to public security and computational epidemiology. A mobility task that is becoming prominent is crowd flow prediction, i.e., forecasting aggregated incoming and outgoing flows in the locations of a geographic region. Although several deep learning approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, their usage is limited to specific types of spatial tessellations and cannot provide sufficient explanations of their predictions. We propose CrowdNet, a solution to crowd flow prediction based on graph convolutional networks. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, CrowdNet can be used with regions of irregular shapes and provide meaningful explanations of the predicted crowd flows. We conduct experiments on public data varying the spatio-temporal granularity of crowd flows to show the superiority of our model with respect to existing methods, and we investigate CrowdNet's reliability to missing or noisy input data. Our model is a step forward in the design of reliable deep learning models to predict and explain human displacements in urban environments.

<p>

**Abstract:** The recent large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) of dual-stream architectures (e.g., CLIP) with a tremendous amount of image-text pair data, has shown its superiority on various multimodal alignment tasks. Despite its success, the resulting models are not capable of multimodal generative tasks due to the weak text encoder. To tackle this problem, we propose to augment the dual-stream VLP model with a textual pre-trained language model (PLM) via vision-language knowledge distillation (VLKD), enabling the capability for multimodal generation. VLKD is pretty data- and computation-efficient compared to the pre-training from scratch. Experimental results show that the resulting model has strong zero-shot performance on multimodal generation tasks, such as open-ended visual question answering and image captioning. For example, it achieves 44.5% zero-shot accuracy on the VQAv2 dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art zero-shot model with $7\times$ fewer parameters. Furthermore, the original textual language understanding and generation ability of the PLM is maintained after VLKD, which makes our model versatile for both multimodal and unimodal tasks.

**Abstract:** Continual/lifelong learning from a non-stationary input data stream is a cornerstone of intelligence. Despite their phenomenal performance in a wide variety of applications, deep neural networks are prone to forgetting their previously learned information upon learning new ones. This phenomenon is called "catastrophic forgetting" and is deeply rooted in the stability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks has become an active field of research in recent years. In particular, gradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional performance at overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes two biologically-inspired mechanisms based on sparsity and heterogeneous dropout that significantly increase a continual learner's performance over a long sequence of tasks. Our proposed approach builds on the Gradient Projection Memory (GPM) framework. We leverage K-winner activations in each layer of a neural network to enforce layer-wise sparse activations for each task, together with a between-task heterogeneous dropout that encourages the network to use non-overlapping activation patterns between different tasks. In addition, we introduce Continual Swiss Roll as a lightweight and interpretable -- yet challenging -- synthetic benchmark for continual learning. Lastly, we provide an in-depth analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate a significant performance boost on various benchmark continual learning problems.

**Abstract:** Computer vision-based parking lot management methods have been extensively researched upon owing to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness. To evaluate such methods authors often employ publicly available parking lot image datasets. In this study, we surveyed and compared robust publicly available image datasets specifically crafted to test computer vision-based methods for parking lot management approaches and consequently present a systematic and comprehensive review of existing works that employ such datasets. The literature review identified relevant gaps that require further research, such as the requirement of dataset-independent approaches and methods suitable for autonomous detection of position of parking spaces. In addition, we have noticed that several important factors such as the presence of the same cars across consecutive images, have been neglected in most studies, thereby rendering unrealistic assessment protocols. Furthermore, the analysis of the datasets also revealed that certain features that should be present when developing new benchmarks, such as the availability of video sequences and images taken in more diverse conditions, including nighttime and snow, have not been incorporated.

**Abstract:** Lithography simulation is a critical step in VLSI design and optimization for manufacturability. Existing solutions for highly accurate lithography simulation with rigorous models are computationally expensive and slow, even when equipped with various approximation techniques. Recently, machine learning has provided alternative solutions for lithography simulation tasks such as coarse-grained edge placement error regression and complete contour prediction. However, the impact of these learning-based methods has been limited due to restrictive usage scenarios or low simulation accuracy. To tackle these concerns, we introduce an dual-band optics-inspired neural network design that considers the optical physics underlying lithography. To the best of our knowledge, our approach yields the first published via/metal layer contour simulation at 1nm^2/pixel resolution with any tile size. Compared to previous machine learning based solutions, we demonstrate that our framework can be trained much faster and offers a significant improvement on efficiency and image quality with 20X smaller model size. We also achieve 85X simulation speedup over traditional lithography simulator with 1% accuracy loss.

**Abstract:** Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) models for clinical decision support. For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models' prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements to correctly indicate AI model decision process or decision quality. The evaluation and MSFI metric can guide the design and selection of XAI algorithms to meet clinical requirements on multi-modal explanation.

<p>

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in recent years since they can identify the vulnerability of deep learning models before deployed. In this paper, we consider the black-box adversarial setting, where the adversary needs to craft adversarial examples without access to the gradients of a target model. Previous methods attempted to approximate the true gradient either by using the transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model or based on the feedback of model queries. However, the existing methods inevitably suffer from low attack success rates or poor query efficiency since it is difficult to estimate the gradient in a high-dimensional input space with limited information. To address these problems and improve black-box attacks, we propose two prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms based on biased sampling and gradient averaging, respectively. Our methods can take the advantage of a transfer-based prior given by the gradient of a surrogate model and the query information simultaneously. Through theoretical analyses, the transfer-based prior is appropriately integrated with model queries by an optimal coefficient in each method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the alternative state-of-the-arts, both of our methods require much fewer queries to attack black-box models with higher success rates.

**Abstract:** Mobile user profiling refers to the efforts of extracting users' characteristics from mobile activities. In order to capture the dynamic varying of user characteristics for generating effective user profiling, we propose an imitation-based mobile user profiling framework. Considering the objective of teaching an autonomous agent to imitate user mobility based on the user's profile, the user profile is the most accurate when the agent can perfectly mimic the user behavior patterns. The profiling framework is formulated into a reinforcement learning task, where an agent is a next-visit planner, an action is a POI that a user will visit next, and the state of the environment is a fused representation of a user and spatial entities. An event in which a user visits a POI will construct a new state, which helps the agent predict users' mobility more accurately. In the framework, we introduce a spatial Knowledge Graph (KG) to characterize the semantics of user visits over connected spatial entities. Additionally, we develop a mutual-updating strategy to quantify the state that evolves over time. Along these lines, we develop a reinforcement imitative graph learning framework for mobile user profiling. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

**Abstract:** The jigsaw puzzle problem (JPP) is a well-known research problem, which has been studied for many years. Solving this problem typically involves a two-stage scheme, consisting of the computation of a pairwise piece compatibility measure (CM), coupled with a subsequent puzzle reconstruction algorithm. Many effective CMs, which apply a simple distance measure, based merely on the information along the piece edges, have been proposed. However, the practicality of these classical methods is rather doubtful for problem instances harder than pure synthetic images. Specifically, these methods tend to break down in more realistic scenarios involving, e.g., monochromatic puzzles, eroded boundaries due to piece degradation over long time periods, missing pieces, etc. To overcome this significant deficiency, a few deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based CMs have been recently introduced. Despite their promising accuracy, these models are very computationally intensive. Twin Embedding Networks (TEN), to represent a piece with respect to its boundary in a latent embedding space. Combining this latent representation with a simple distance measure, we then demonstrate a superior performance, in terms of accuracy, of our newly proposed pairwise CM, compared to that of various classical methods, for the problem domain of eroded tile boundaries, a testbed for a number of real-world JPP variants. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that TEN is faster by a few orders of magnitude, on average, than the recent NN models, i.e., it is as fast as the classical methods. In this regard, the paper makes a significant first attempt at bridging the gap between the relatively low accuracy (of classical methods) and the intensive computational complexity (of NN models), for practical, real-world puzzle-like problems.

**Abstract:** 4D CT imaging is an essential component of radiotherapy of thoracic/abdominal tumors. 4D CT images are, however, often affected by artifacts that compromise treatment planning quality. In this work, deep learning (DL)-based conditional inpainting is proposed to restore anatomically correct image information of artifact-affected areas. The restoration approach consists of a two-stage process: DL-based detection of common interpolation (INT) and double structure (DS) artifacts, followed by conditional inpainting applied to the artifact areas. In this context, conditional refers to a guidance of the inpainting process by patient-specific image data to ensure anatomically reliable results. Evaluation is based on 65 in-house 4D CT data sets of lung cancer patients (48 with only slight artifacts, 17 with pronounced artifacts) and the publicly available DIRLab 4D CT data (independent external test set). Automated artifact detection revealed a ROC-AUC of 0.99 for INT and 0.97 for DS artifacts (in-house data). The proposed inpainting method decreased the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 60% (DS) and 42% (INT) for the in-house evaluation data (simulated artifacts for the slight artifact data; original data were considered as ground truth for RMSE computation). For the external DIR-Lab data, the RMSE decreased by 65% and 36%, respectively. Applied to the pronounced artifact data group, on average 68% of the detectable artifacts were removed. The results highlight the potential of DL-based inpainting for the restoration of artifact-affected 4D CT data. Improved performance of conditional inpainting (compared to standard inpainting) illustrates the benefits of exploiting patient-specific prior knowledge.

**Abstract:** This paper combines the power of deep-learning with the generalizability of physics-based features, to present an advanced method for seismic discrimination between earthquakes and explosions. The proposed method contains two branches: a deep learning branch operating directly on seismic waveforms or spectrograms, and a second branch operating on physics-based parametric features. These features are high-frequency P/S amplitude ratios and the difference between local magnitude (ML) and coda duration magnitude (MC). The combination achieves better generalization performance when applied to new regions than models that are developed solely with deep learning. We also examined which parts of the waveform data dominate deep learning decisions (i.e., via Grad-CAM). Such visualization provides a window into the black-box nature of the machine-learning models and offers new insight into how the deep learning derived models use data to make the decisions.

**Abstract:** The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the most widely used statistical models for sequential data analysis, and it has been successfully applied in a large variety of domains. One of the key reasons for this versatility is the ability of HMMs to deal with missing data. However, standard HMM learning algorithms rely crucially on the assumption that the positions of the missing observations within the observation sequence are known. In some situations where such assumptions are not feasible, a number of special algorithms have been developed. Currently, these algorithms rely strongly on specific structural assumptions of the underlying chain, such as acyclicity, and are not applicable in the general case. In particular, there are numerous domains within medicine and computational biology, where the missing observation locations are unknown and acyclicity assumptions do not hold, thus presenting a barrier for the application of HMMs in those fields. In this paper we consider a general problem of learning HMMs from data with unknown missing observation locations (i.e., only the order of the non-missing observations are known). We introduce a generative model of the location omissions and propose two learning methods for this model, a (semi) analytic approach, and a Gibbs sampler. We evaluate and compare the algorithms in a variety of scenarios, measuring their reconstruction precision and robustness under model misspecification.

**Abstract:** Predictive Virtual Machine (VM) auto-scaling is a promising technique to optimize cloud applications operating costs and performance. Understanding the job arrival rate is crucial for accurately predicting future changes in cloud workloads and proactively provisioning and de-provisioning VMs for hosting the applications. However, developing a model that accurately predicts cloud workload changes is extremely challenging due to the dynamic nature of cloud workloads. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models have been developed for cloud workload prediction. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art LSTM model leverages recurrences to predict, which naturally adds complexity and increases the inference overhead as input sequences grow longer. To develop a cloud workload prediction model with high accuracy and low inference overhead, this work presents a novel time-series forecasting model called WGAN-gp Transformer, inspired by the Transformer network and improved Wasserstein-GANs. The proposed method adopts a Transformer network as a generator and a multi-layer perceptron as a critic. The extensive evaluations with real-world workload traces show WGAN-gp Transformer achieves 5 times faster inference time with up to 5.1 percent higher prediction accuracy against the state-of-the-art approach. We also apply WGAN-gp Transformer to auto-scaling mechanisms on Google cloud platforms, and the WGAN-gp Transformer-based auto-scaling mechanism outperforms the LSTM-based mechanism by significantly reducing VM over-provisioning and under-provisioning rates.

**Abstract:** Simulation-based inference (SBI) refers to statistical inference on stochastic models for which we can generate samples, but not compute likelihoods. Like SBI algorithms, generative adversarial networks (GANs) do not require explicit likelihoods. We study the relationship between SBI and GANs, and introduce GATSBI, an adversarial approach to SBI. GATSBI reformulates the variational objective in an adversarial setting to learn implicit posterior distributions. Inference with GATSBI is amortised across observations, works in high-dimensional posterior spaces and supports implicit priors. We evaluate GATSBI on two SBI benchmark problems and on two high-dimensional simulators. On a model for wave propagation on the surface of a shallow water body, we show that GATSBI can return well-calibrated posterior estimates even in high dimensions. On a model of camera optics, it infers a high-dimensional posterior given an implicit prior, and performs better than a state-of-the-art SBI approach. We also show how GATSBI can be extended to perform sequential posterior estimation to focus on individual observations. Overall, GATSBI opens up opportunities for leveraging advances in GANs to perform Bayesian inference on high-dimensional simulation-based models.

**Abstract:** 6G envisions artificial intelligence (AI) powered solutions for enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) in the network and to ensure optimal utilization of resources. In this work, we propose an architecture based on the combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), AI and blockchain for agricultural supply-chain management with the purpose of ensuring traceability, transparency, tracking inventories and contracts. We propose a solution to facilitate on-device AI by generating a roadmap of models with various resource-accuracy trade-offs. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN) model is used for biomass estimation through images captured by the UAV. Instead of a single compressed FCN model for deployment on UAV, we motivate the idea of iterative pruning to provide multiple task-specific models with various complexities and accuracy. To alleviate the impact of flight failure in a 6G enabled dynamic UAV network, the proposed model selection strategy will assist UAVs to update the model based on the runtime resource requirements.

Based on predicted active cases, the demand of lower-level units and total availability, allocation, and lockdown decision is made. A MATLAB-based GUI is developed based on the proposed DSS and could be implemented by the local authority.

**Abstract:** For diagnosis of shoulder illness, it is essential to look at the morphology deviation of scapula and humerus from the medical images that are acquired from Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. However, taking high-resolution MR images is time-consuming and costly because the reduction of the physical distance between image slices causes prolonged scanning time. Moreover, due to the lack of training images, images from various sources must be utilized, which creates the issue of high variance across the dataset. Also, there are human errors among the images due to the fact that it is hard to take the spatial relationship into consideration when labeling the 3D image in low resolution. In order to combat all obstacles stated above, we develop a fully automated algorithm for segmenting the humerus and scapula bone from coarsely scanned and low-resolution MR images and a recursive learning framework that iterative utilize the generated labels for reducing the errors among segmentations and increase our dataset set for training the next round network. In this study, 50 MR images are collected from several institutions and divided into five mutually exclusive sets for carrying five-fold cross-validation. Contours that are generated by the proposed method demonstrated a high level of accuracy when compared with ground truth and the traditional method. The proposed neural network and the recursive learning scheme improve the overall quality of the segmentation on humerus and scapula on the low-resolution dataset and reduced incorrect segmentation in the ground truth, which could have a positive impact on finding the cause of shoulder pain and patient's early relief.

**Abstract:** Benefited from the rapid and sustainable development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, change detection from SAR images has received increasing attentions over the past few years. Existing unsupervised deep learning-based methods have made great efforts to exploit robust feature representations, but they consume much time to optimize parameters. Besides, these methods use clustering to obtain pseudo-labels for training, and the pseudo-labeled samples often involve errors, which can be considered as "label noise". To address these issues, we propose a Dual Path Denoising Network (DPDNet) for SAR image change detection. In particular, we introduce the random label propagation to clean the label noise involved in preclassification. We also propose the distinctive patch convolution for feature representation learning to reduce the time consumption. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to select distinctive pixels in the feature maps, and patches around these pixels are selected as convolution kernels. Consequently, the DPDNet does not require a great number of training samples for parameter optimization, and its computational efficiency is greatly enhanced. Extensive experiments have been conducted on five SAR datasets to verify the proposed DPDNet. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in change detection results.

**Abstract:** Joint source channel coding (JSCC) has attracted increasing attentions due to its robustness and high efficiency. However, the existing research on JSCC mainly focuses on minimizing the distortion between the transmitted and received information, while limiting the required data rate. Therefore, even though the transmitted information is well recovered, the transmitted bits may be far more than the minimal threshold according to the rate-distortion (RD) theory. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Information Bottleneck (IB) guided JSCC (AIB-JSCC), which aims at achieving the theoretically maximal compression ratio for a given reconstruction quality. In particular, we first derive a mathematically tractable form of loss function for AIB-JSCC. To keep a better tradeoff between compression and reconstruction quality, we further propose an adaptive algorithm that adjusts hyperparameter beta of the proposed loss function dynamically according to the distortion during training. Experiment results show that AIB-JSCC can significantly reduce the required amount of the transmitted data and improve the reconstruction quality and downstream artificial-intelligent task performance.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art video deblurring methods often adopt recurrent neural networks to model the temporal dependency between the frames. While the hidden states play key role in delivering information to the next frame, abrupt motion blur tend to weaken the relevance in the neighbor frames. In this paper, we propose recurrence-in-recurrence network architecture to cope with the limitations of short-ranged memory. We employ additional recurrent units inside the RNN cell. First, we employ inner-recurrence module (IRM) to manage the long-ranged dependency in a sequence. IRM learns to keep track of the cell memory and provides complementary information to find the deblurred frames. Second, we adopt an attention-based temporal blending strategy to extract the necessary part of the information in the local neighborhood. The adpative temporal blending (ATB) can either attenuate or amplify the features by the spatial attention. Our extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness of IRM and ATB on various RNN architectures.

**Abstract:** Session-based recommendation is a challenging problem in the real-world scenes, e.g., ecommerce, short video platforms, and music platforms, which aims to predict the next click action based on the anonymous session. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art methods for session-based recommendation. However, we find that there exist two limitations in these methods. One is the item transition relations are not fully exploited since the relations are not explicitly modeled. Another is the long-range dependencies between items can not be captured effectively due to the limitation of GNNs. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel approach for session-based recommendation, called Transition Relation Aware Self-Attention (TRASA). Specifically, TRASA first converts the session to a graph and then encodes the shortest path between items through the gated recurrent unit as their transition relation. Then, to capture the long-range dependencies, TRASA utilizes the self-attention mechanism to build the direct connection between any two items without going through intermediate ones. Also, the transition relations are incorporated explicitly when computing the attention scores. Extensive experiments on three real-word datasets demonstrate that TRASA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods consistently.

**Abstract:** Due to the high cost of manually annotating medical images, especially for large-scale datasets, anomaly detection has been explored through training models with only normal data. Lacking prior knowledge of true anomalies is the main reason for the limited application of previous anomaly detection methods, especially in the medical image analysis realm. In this work, we propose a one-shot anomaly detection framework, namely LesionPaste, that utilizes true anomalies from a single annotated sample and synthesizes artificial anomalous samples for anomaly detection. First, a lesion bank is constructed by applying augmentation to randomly selected lesion patches. Then, MixUp is adopted to paste patches from the lesion bank at random positions in normal images to synthesize anomalous samples for training. Finally, a classification network is trained using the synthetic abnormal samples and the true normal data. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly-available medical image datasets with different types of abnormalities. On both datasets, our proposed LesionPaste largely outperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection methods, and is on a par with the fully-supervised counterpart. To note, LesionPaste is even better than the fully-supervised method in detecting early-stage diabetic retinopathy.

**Abstract:** For humans, our "senses of touch" have always been necessary for our ability to precisely and efficiently manipulate objects of all shapes in any environment, but until recently, not many works have been done to fully understand haptic feedback. This work proposed a novel method for getting a better shape descriptor than existing methods for classifying an object from multiple tactile data collected from a tactile glove. It focuses on improving previous works on object classification using tactile data. The major problem for object classification from multiple tactile data is to find a good way to aggregate features extracted from multiple tactile images. We propose a novel method, dubbed as Tactile-ViewGCN, that hierarchically aggregate tactile features considering relations among different features by using Graph Convolutional Network. Our model outperforms previous methods on the STAG dataset with an accuracy of 81.82%.

**Abstract:** In a model inversion attack, an adversary attempts to reconstruct the data records, used to train a target model, using only the model's output. In launching a contemporary model inversion attack, the strategies discussed are generally based on either predicted confidence score vectors, i.e., black-box attacks, or the parameters of a target model, i.e., white-box attacks. However, in the real world, model owners usually only give out the predicted labels; the confidence score vectors and model parameters are hidden as a defense mechanism to prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, we have found a model inversion method that can reconstruct the input data records based only on the output labels. We believe this is the attack that requires the least information to succeed and, therefore, has the best applicability. The key idea is to exploit the error rate of the target model to compute the median distance from a set of data records to the decision boundary of the target model. The distance, then, is used to generate confidence score vectors which are adopted to train an attack model to reconstruct the data records. The experimental results show that highly recognizable data records can be reconstructed with far less information than existing methods.

**Abstract:** Long Document retrieval (DR) has always been a tremendous challenge for reading comprehension and information retrieval. The pre-training model has achieved good results in the retrieval stage and Ranking for long documents in recent years. However, there is still some crucial problem in long document ranking, such as data label noises, long document representations, negative data Unbalanced sampling, etc. To eliminate the noise of labeled data and to be able to sample the long documents in the search reasonably negatively, we propose the bag sampling method and the group-wise Localized Contrastive Estimation(LCE) method. We use the head middle tail passage for the long document to encode the long document, and in the retrieval, stage Use dense retrieval to generate the candidate's data. The retrieval data is divided into multiple bags at the ranking stage, and negative samples are selected in each bag. After sampling, two losses are combined. The first loss is LCE. To fit bag sampling well, after query and document are encoded, the global features of each group are extracted by convolutional layer and max-pooling to improve the model's resistance to the impact of labeling noise, finally, calculate the LCE group-wise loss. Notably, our model shows excellent performance on the MS MARCO Long document ranking leaderboard.

**Abstract:** Session-based recommendation tries to make use of anonymous session data to deliver high-quality recommendation under the condition that user-profiles and the complete historical behavioral data of a target user are unavailable. Previous works consider each session individually and try to capture user interests within a session. Despite their encouraging results, these models can only perceive intra-session items and cannot draw upon the massive historical relational information. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method named G$^3$SR (Global Graph Guided Session-based Recommendation). G$^3$SR decomposes the session-based recommendation workflow into two steps. First, a global graph is built upon all session data, from which the global item representations are learned in an unsupervised manner. Then, these representations are refined on session graphs under the graph networks, and a readout function is used to generate session representations for each session. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmark datasets show remarkable and consistent improvements of the G$^3$SR method over the state-of-the-art methods, especially for cold items.

**Abstract:** Indirect speech such as sarcasm achieves a constellation of discourse goals in human communication. While the indirectness of figurative language warrants speakers to achieve certain pragmatic goals, it is challenging for AI agents to comprehend such idiosyncrasies of human communication. Though sarcasm identification has been a well-explored topic in dialogue analysis, for conversational systems to truly grasp a conversation's innate meaning and generate appropriate responses, simply detecting sarcasm is not enough; it is vital to explain its underlying sarcastic connotation to capture its true essence. In this work, we study the discourse structure of sarcastic conversations and propose a novel task - Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED). Set in a multimodal and code-mixed setting, the task aims to generate natural language explanations of satirical conversations. To this end, we curate WITS, a new dataset to support our task. We propose MAF (Modality Aware Fusion), a multimodal context-aware attention and global information fusion module to capture multimodality and use it to benchmark WITS. The proposed attention module surpasses the traditional multimodal fusion baselines and reports the best performance on almost all metrics. Lastly, we carry out detailed analyses both quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract:** Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a vital classification tool in statistics and machine learning. This paper investigates the varying coefficient LDA model for dynamic data, with Bayes' discriminant direction being a function of some exposure variable to address the heterogeneity. By deriving a new discriminant direction function parallel with Bayes' direction, we propose a least-square estimation procedure based on the B-spline approximation. For high-dimensional regime, the corresponding data-driven discriminant rule is more computationally efficient than the existed dynamic linear programming rule. We also establish the corresponding theoretical results, including estimation error bound and the uniform excess misclassification rate. Numerical experiments on synthetic data and real data both corroborate the superiority of our proposed classification method.
