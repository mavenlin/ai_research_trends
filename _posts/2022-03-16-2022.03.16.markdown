**Abstract:** End-to-end Network has become increasingly important in multi-tasking. One prominent example of this is the growing significance of a driving perception system in autonomous driving. This paper systematically studies an end-to-end perception network for multi-tasking and proposes several key optimizations to improve accuracy. First, the paper proposes efficient segmentation head and box/class prediction networks based on weighted bidirectional feature network. Second, the paper proposes automatically customized anchor for each level in the weighted bidirectional feature network. Third, the paper proposes an efficient training loss function and training strategy to balance and optimize network. Based on these optimizations, we have developed an end-to-end perception network to perform multi-tasking, including traffic object detection, drivable area segmentation and lane detection simultaneously, called HybridNets, which achieves better accuracy than prior art. In particular, HybridNets achieves 77.3 mean Average Precision on Berkeley DeepDrive Dataset, outperforms lane detection with 31.6 mean Intersection Over Union with 12.83 million parameters and 15.6 billion floating-point operations. In addition, it can perform visual perception tasks in real-time and thus is a practical and accurate solution to the multi-tasking problem. Code is available at https://github.com/datvuthanh/HybridNets.

**Abstract:** We currently witness the spectacular success of artificial intelligence in both science and public life. However, the development of a rigorous mathematical foundation is still at an early stage. In this survey article, which is based on an invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians 2022, we will in particular focus on the current "workhorse" of artificial intelligence, namely deep neural networks. We will present the main theoretical directions along with several exemplary results and discuss key open problems.

**Abstract:** Language models typically need to be trained or finetuned in order to acquire new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.

<p>

**Abstract:** As more and more AI agents are used in practice, it is time to think about how to make these agents fully autonomous so that they can (1) learn by themselves continually in a self-motivated and self-initiated manner rather than being retrained offline periodically on the initiation of human engineers and (2) accommodate or adapt to unexpected or novel circumstances. As the real-world is an open environment that is full of unknowns or novelties, detecting novelties, characterizing them, accommodating or adapting to them, and gathering ground-truth training data and incrementally learning the unknowns/novelties are critical to making the AI agent more and more knowledgeable and powerful over time. The key challenge is how to automate the process so that it is carried out continually on the agent's own initiative and through its own interactions with humans, other agents and the environment just like human on-the-job learning. This paper proposes a framework (called SOLA) for this learning paradigm to promote the research of building autonomous and continual learning enabled AI agents. To show feasibility, an implemented agent is also described.

**Abstract:** A common problem in data science is "use this function defined over this small set to generate predictions over that larger set." Extrapolation, interpolation, statistical inference and forecasting all reduce to this problem. The Kan extension is a powerful tool in category theory that generalizes this notion. In this work we explore several applications of Kan extensions to data science. We begin by deriving a simple classification algorithm as a Kan extension and experimenting with this algorithm on real data. Next, we use the Kan extension to derive a procedure for learning clustering algorithms from labels and explore the performance of this procedure on real data. We then investigate how Kan extensions can be used to learn a general mapping from datasets of labeled examples to functions and to approximate a complex function with a simpler one.

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successful in solving tasks in computer vision including medical image segmentation due to their ability to automatically extract features from unstructured data. However, CNNs are sensitive to rotation and affine transformation and their success relies on huge-scale labeled datasets capturing various input variations. This network paradigm has posed challenges at scale because acquiring annotated data for medical segmentation is expensive, and strict privacy regulations. Furthermore, visual representation learning with CNNs has its own flaws, e.g., it is arguable that the pooling layer in traditional CNNs tends to discard positional information and CNNs tend to fail on input images that differ in orientations and sizes. Capsule network (CapsNet) is a recent new architecture that has achieved better robustness in representation learning by replacing pooling layers with dynamic routing and convolutional strides, which has shown potential results on popular tasks such as classification, recognition, segmentation, and natural language processing. Different from CNNs, which result in scalar outputs, CapsNet returns vector outputs, which aim to preserve the part-whole relationships. In this work, we first introduce the limitations of CNNs and fundamentals of CapsNet. We then provide recent developments of CapsNet for the task of medical image segmentation. We finally discuss various effective network architectures to implement a CapsNet for both 2D images and 3D volumetric medical image segmentation.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover and localize semantically meaningful categories within image corpora without any form of annotation. To solve this task, algorithms must produce features for every pixel that are both semantically meaningful and compact enough to form distinct clusters. Unlike previous works which achieve this with a single end-to-end framework, we propose to separate feature learning from cluster compactification. Empirically, we show that current unsupervised feature learning frameworks already generate dense features whose correlations are semantically consistent. This observation motivates us to design STEGO ($\textbf{S}$elf-supervised $\textbf{T}$ransformer with $\textbf{E}$nergy-based $\textbf{G}$raph $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a novel framework that distills unsupervised features into high-quality discrete semantic labels. At the core of STEGO is a novel contrastive loss function that encourages features to form compact clusters while preserving their relationships across the corpora. STEGO yields a significant improvement over the prior state of the art, on both the CocoStuff ($\textbf{+14 mIoU}$) and Cityscapes ($\textbf{+9 mIoU}$) semantic segmentation challenges.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose a new differentiable probabilistic model over DAGs (DP-DAG). DP-DAG allows fast and differentiable DAG sampling suited to continuous optimization. To this end, DP-DAG samples a DAG by successively (1) sampling a linear ordering of the node and (2) sampling edges consistent with the sampled linear ordering. We further propose VI-DP-DAG, a new method for DAG learning from observational data which combines DP-DAG with variational inference. Hence,VI-DP-DAG approximates the posterior probability over DAG edges given the observed data. VI-DP-DAG is guaranteed to output a valid DAG at any time during training and does not require any complex augmented Lagrangian optimization scheme in contrast to existing differentiable DAG learning approaches. In our extensive experiments, we compare VI-DP-DAG to other differentiable DAG learning baselines on synthetic and real datasets. VI-DP-DAG significantly improves DAG structure and causal mechanism learning while training faster than competitors.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised Learning (SSL) including the mainstream contrastive learning has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data annotations. However, most methods mainly focus on the instance level information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the feature embeddings of different augmentations. To boost the performance, we argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more reliable relation, and leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency. The designed asymmetric predictor head and an InfoNCE warm-up strategy enhance the robustness to hyper-parameters and benefit the resulting performance. Experimental results show that our proposed ReSSL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across different network architectures, including various lightweight networks (\eg, EfficientNet and MobileNet).

**Abstract:** Some examples are easier for humans to classify than others. The same should be true for deep neural networks (DNNs). We use the term example perplexity to refer to the level of difficulty of classifying an example. In this paper, we propose a method to measure the perplexity of an example and investigate what factors contribute to high example perplexity.

<p>

**Abstract:** The promise of self-supervised learning (SSL) is to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to solve complex tasks. While there has been excellent progress with simple, image-level learning, recent methods have shown the advantage of including knowledge of image structure. However, by introducing hand-crafted image segmentations to define regions of interest, or specialized augmentation strategies, these methods sacrifice the simplicity and generality that makes SSL so powerful. Instead, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm that discovers the structure encoded in these priors by itself. Our method, Odin, couples object discovery and representation networks to discover meaningful image segmentations without any supervision. The resulting learning paradigm is simpler, less brittle, and more general, and achieves state-of-the-art transfer learning results for object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on PASCAL and Cityscapes, while strongly surpassing supervised pre-training for video segmentation on DAVIS.

**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks for classification usually jointly learn a backbone for representation and a linear classifier to output the logit of each class. A recent study has shown a phenomenon called neural collapse that the within-class means of features and the classifier vectors converge to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) at the terminal phase of training on a balanced dataset. Since the ETF geometric structure maximally separates the pair-wise angles of all classes in the classifier, it is natural to raise the question, why do we spend an effort to learn a classifier when we know its optimal geometric structure? In this paper, we study the potential of learning a neural network for classification with the classifier randomly initialized as an ETF and fixed during training. Our analytical work based on the layer-peeled model indicates that the feature learning with a fixed ETF classifier naturally leads to the neural collapse state even when the dataset is imbalanced among classes. We further show that in this case the cross entropy (CE) loss is not necessary and can be replaced by a simple squared loss that shares the same global optimality but enjoys a more accurate gradient and better convergence property. Our experimental results show that our method is able to achieve similar performances on image classification for balanced datasets, and bring significant improvements in the long-tailed and fine-grained classification tasks.

**Abstract:** Morphologically-rich polysynthetic languages present a challenge for NLP systems due to data sparsity, and a common strategy to handle this issue is to apply subword segmentation. We investigate a wide variety of supervised and unsupervised morphological segmentation methods for four polysynthetic languages: Nahuatl, Raramuri, Shipibo-Konibo, and Wixarika. Then, we compare the morphologically inspired segmentation methods against Byte-Pair Encodings (BPEs) as inputs for machine translation (MT) when translating to and from Spanish. We show that for all language pairs except for Nahuatl, an unsupervised morphological segmentation algorithm outperforms BPEs consistently and that, although supervised methods achieve better segmentation scores, they under-perform in MT challenges. Finally, we contribute two new morphological segmentation datasets for Raramuri and Shipibo-Konibo, and a parallel corpus for Raramuri--Spanish.

**Abstract:** Retrieval-based methods have been shown to be effective in NLP tasks via introducing external knowledge. However, the indexing and retrieving of large-scale corpora bring considerable computational cost. Surprisingly, we found that REtrieving from the traINing datA (REINA) only can lead to significant gains on multiple NLG and NLU tasks. We retrieve the labeled training instances most similar to the input text and then concatenate them with the input to feed into the model to generate the output. Experimental results show that this simple method can achieve significantly better performance on a variety of NLU and NLG tasks, including summarization, machine translation, language modeling, and question answering tasks. For instance, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on XSum, BigPatent, and CommonsenseQA. Our code is released, https://github.com/microsoft/REINA .

**Abstract:** Industrial machine learning systems face data challenges that are often under-explored in the academic literature. Common data challenges are data distribution shifts, missing values and anomalies. In this paper, we discuss data challenges and solutions in the context of a Neural Forecasting application on labor planning.We discuss how to make this forecasting system resilient to these data challenges. We address changes in data distribution with a periodic retraining scheme and discuss the critical importance of model stability in this setting. Furthermore, we show how our deep learning model deals with missing values natively without requiring imputation. Finally, we describe how we detect anomalies in the input data and mitigate their effect before they impact the forecasts. This results in a fully autonomous forecasting system that compares favorably to a hybrid system consisting of the algorithm and human overrides.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art distillation methods are mainly based on distilling deep features from intermediate layers, while the significance of logit distillation is greatly overlooked. To provide a novel viewpoint to study logit distillation, we reformulate the classical KD loss into two parts, i.e., target class knowledge distillation (TCKD) and non-target class knowledge distillation (NCKD). We empirically investigate and prove the effects of the two parts: TCKD transfers knowledge concerning the "difficulty" of training samples, while NCKD is the prominent reason why logit distillation works. More importantly, we reveal that the classical KD loss is a coupled formulation, which (1) suppresses the effectiveness of NCKD and (2) limits the flexibility to balance these two parts. To address these issues, we present Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), enabling TCKD and NCKD to play their roles more efficiently and flexibly. Compared with complex feature-based methods, our DKD achieves comparable or even better results and has better training efficiency on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets for image classification and object detection tasks. This paper proves the great potential of logit distillation, and we hope it will be helpful for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/mdistiller.

<p>

**Abstract:** When monitoring machine learning systems, two-sample tests of homogeneity form the foundation upon which existing approaches to drift detection build. They are used to test for evidence that the distribution underlying recent deployment data differs from that underlying the historical reference data. Often, however, various factors such as time-induced correlation mean that batches of recent deployment data are not expected to form an i.i.d. sample from the historical data distribution. Instead we may wish to test for differences in the distributions conditional on \textit{context} that is permitted to change. To facilitate this we borrow machinery from the causal inference domain to develop a more general drift detection framework built upon a foundation of two-sample tests for conditional distributional treatment effects. We recommend a particular instantiation of the framework based on maximum conditional mean discrepancies. We then provide an empirical study demonstrating its effectiveness for various drift detection problems of practical interest, such as detecting drift in the distributions underlying subpopulations of data in a manner that is insensitive to their respective prevalences. The study additionally demonstrates applicability to ImageNet-scale vision problems.

<p>

**Abstract:** A recent line of work on black-box adversarial attacks has revived the use of transfer from surrogate models by integrating it into query-based search. However, we find that existing approaches of this type underperform their potential, and can be overly complicated besides. Here, we provide a short and simple algorithm which achieves state-of-the-art results through a search which uses the surrogate network's class-score gradients, with no need for other priors or heuristics. The guiding assumption of the algorithm is that the studied networks are in a fundamental sense learning similar functions, and that a transfer attack from one to the other should thus be fairly "easy". This assumption is validated by the extremely low query counts and failure rates achieved: e.g. an untargeted attack on a VGG-16 ImageNet network using a ResNet-152 as the surrogate yields a median query count of 6 at a success rate of 99.9%.

**Abstract:** We conduct a feasibility study into the applicability of answer-unaware question generation models to textbook passages. We show that a significant portion of errors in such systems arise from asking irrelevant or uninterpretable questions and that such errors can be ameliorated by providing summarized input. We find that giving these models human-written summaries instead of the original text results in a significant increase in acceptability of generated questions (33% $\rightarrow$ 83%) as determined by expert annotators. We also find that, in the absence of human-written summaries, automatic summarization can serve as a good middle ground.

<p>

**Abstract:** Patch attacks, one of the most threatening forms of physical attack in adversarial examples, can lead networks to induce misclassification by modifying pixels arbitrarily in a continuous region. Certifiable patch defense can guarantee robustness that the classifier is not affected by patch attacks. Existing certifiable patch defenses sacrifice the clean accuracy of classifiers and only obtain a low certified accuracy on toy datasets. Furthermore, the clean and certified accuracy of these methods is still significantly lower than the accuracy of normal classification networks, which limits their application in practice. To move towards a practical certifiable patch defense, we introduce Vision Transformer (ViT) into the framework of Derandomized Smoothing (DS). Specifically, we propose a progressive smoothed image modeling task to train Vision Transformer, which can capture the more discriminable local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. For efficient inference and deployment in the real world, we innovatively reconstruct the global self-attention structure of the original ViT into isolated band unit self-attention. On ImageNet, under 2% area patch attacks our method achieves 41.70% certified accuracy, a nearly 1-fold increase over the previous best method (26.00%). Simultaneously, our method achieves 78.58% clean accuracy, which is quite close to the normal ResNet-101 accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art clean and certified accuracy with inferring efficiently on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

**Abstract:** De novo peptide sequencing from mass spectrometry data is an important method for protein identification. Recently, various deep learning approaches were applied for de novo peptide sequencing and DeepNovoV2 is one of the represetative models. In this study, we proposed an enhanced model, DePS, which can improve the accuracy of de novo peptide sequencing even with missing signal peaks or large number of noisy peaks in tandem mass spectrometry data. It is showed that, for the same test set of DeepNovoV2, the DePS model achieved excellent results of 74.22%, 74.21% and 41.68% for amino acid recall, amino acid precision and peptide recall respectively. Furthermore, the results suggested that DePS outperforms DeepNovoV2 on the cross species dataset.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we approach the task of determining sensitivity bounds for pose estimation neural networks. This task is particularly challenging as it requires characterizing the sensitivity of 3D rotations. We develop a sensitivity measure that describes the maximum rotational change in a network's output with respect to a Euclidean change in its input. We show that this measure is a type of Lipschitz constant, and that it is bounded by the product of a network's Euclidean Lipschitz constant and an intrinsic property of a rotation parameterization which we call the "distance ratio constant". We derive the distance ratio constant for several rotation parameterizations, and then discuss why the structure of most of these parameterizations makes it difficult to construct a pose estimation network with provable sensitivity bounds. However, we show that sensitivity bounds can be computed for networks which parameterize rotation using unconstrained exponential coordinates. We then construct and train such a network and compute sensitivity bounds for it.

**Abstract:** This paper presents new hierarchically cascaded transformers that can improve data efficiency through attribute surrogates learning and spectral tokens pooling. Vision transformers have recently been thought of as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for visual recognition. But when there is no sufficient data, it gets stuck in overfitting and shows inferior performance. To improve data efficiency, we propose hierarchically cascaded transformers that exploit intrinsic image structures through spectral tokens pooling and optimize the learnable parameters through latent attribute surrogates. The intrinsic image structure is utilized to reduce the ambiguity between foreground content and background noise by spectral tokens pooling. And the attribute surrogate learning scheme is designed to benefit from the rich visual information in image-label pairs instead of simple visual concepts assigned by their labels. Our Hierarchically Cascaded Transformers, called HCTransformers, is built upon a self-supervised learning framework DINO and is tested on several popular few-shot learning benchmarks.
  In the inductive setting, HCTransformers surpass the DINO baseline by a large margin of 9.7% 5-way 1-shot accuracy and 9.17% 5-way 5-shot accuracy on miniImageNet, which demonstrates HCTransformers are efficient to extract discriminative features. Also, HCTransformers show clear advantages over SOTA few-shot classification methods in both 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings on four popular benchmark datasets, including miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, FC100, and CIFAR-FS.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network training framework that increases model's adversarial robustness to adversarial attacks while maintaining high clean accuracy by combining contrastive learning (CL) with adversarial training (AT). We propose to improve model robustness to adversarial attacks by learning feature representations that are consistent under both data augmentations and adversarial perturbations. We leverage contrastive learning to improve adversarial robustness by considering an adversarial example as another positive example, and aim to maximize the similarity between random augmentations of data samples and their adversarial example, while constantly updating the classification head in order to avoid a cognitive dissociation between the classification head and the embedding space. This dissociation is caused by the fact that CL updates the network up to the embedding space, while freezing the classification head which is used to generate new positive adversarial examples. We validate our method, Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Features(CLAF), on the CIFAR-10 dataset on which it outperforms both robust accuracy and clean accuracy over alternative supervised and self-supervised adversarial learning methods.

**Abstract:** Every uncalibrated classifier has a corresponding true calibration map that calibrates its confidence. Deviations of this idealistic map from the identity map reveal miscalibration. Such calibration errors can be reduced with many post-hoc calibration methods which fit some family of calibration maps on a validation dataset. In contrast, evaluation of calibration with the expected calibration error (ECE) on the test set does not explicitly involve fitting. However, as we demonstrate, ECE can still be viewed as if fitting a family of functions on the test data. This motivates the fit-on-the-test view on evaluation: first, approximate a calibration map on the test data, and second, quantify its distance from the identity. Exploiting this view allows us to unlock missed opportunities: (1) use the plethora of post-hoc calibration methods for evaluating calibration; (2) tune the number of bins in ECE with cross-validation. Furthermore, we introduce: (3) benchmarking on pseudo-real data where the true calibration map can be estimated very precisely; and (4) novel calibration and evaluation methods using new calibration map families PL and PL3.

**Abstract:** Deep learning methods have been successful in solving tasks in machine learning and have made breakthroughs in many sectors owing to their ability to automatically extract features from unstructured data. However, their performance relies on manual trial-and-error processes for selecting an appropriate network architecture, hyperparameters for training, and pre-/post-procedures. Even though it has been shown that network architecture plays a critical role in learning feature representation feature from data and the final performance, searching for the best network architecture is computationally intensive and heavily relies on researchers' experience. Automated machine learning (AutoML) and its advanced techniques i.e. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have been promoted to address those limitations. Not only in general computer vision tasks, but NAS has also motivated various applications in multiple areas including medical imaging. In medical imaging, NAS has significant progress in improving the accuracy of image classification, segmentation, reconstruction, and more. However, NAS requires the availability of large annotated data, considerable computation resources, and pre-defined tasks. To address such limitations, meta-learning has been adopted in the scenarios of few-shot learning and multiple tasks. In this book chapter, we first present a brief review of NAS by discussing well-known approaches in search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. We then introduce various NAS approaches in medical imaging with different applications such as classification, segmentation, detection, reconstruction, etc. Meta-learning in NAS for few-shot learning and multiple tasks is then explained. Finally, we describe several open problems in NAS.

**Abstract:** Objective: Disease knowledge graphs are a way to connect, organize, and access disparate information about diseases with numerous benefits for artificial intelligence (AI). To create knowledge graphs, it is necessary to extract knowledge from multimodal datasets in the form of relationships between disease concepts and normalize both concepts and relationship types. Methods: We introduce REMAP, a multimodal approach for disease relation extraction and classification. The REMAP machine learning approach jointly embeds a partial, incomplete knowledge graph and a medical language dataset into a compact latent vector space, followed by aligning the multimodal embeddings for optimal disease relation extraction. Results: We apply REMAP approach to a disease knowledge graph with 96,913 relations and a text dataset of 1.24 million sentences. On a dataset annotated by human experts, REMAP improves text-based disease relation extraction by 10.0% (accuracy) and 17.2% (F1-score) by fusing disease knowledge graphs with text information. Further, REMAP leverages text information to recommend new relationships in the knowledge graph, outperforming graph-based methods by 8.4% (accuracy) and 10.4% (F1-score). Discussion: Systematized knowledge is becoming the backbone of AI, creating opportunities to inject semantics into AI and fully integrate it into machine learning algorithms. While prior semantic knowledge can assist in extracting disease relationships from text, existing methods can not fully leverage multimodal datasets. Conclusion: REMAP is a multimodal approach for extracting and classifying disease relationships by fusing structured knowledge and text information. REMAP provides a flexible neural architecture to easily find, access, and validate AI-driven relationships between disease concepts.

**Abstract:** Existing self-explaining models typically favor extracting the shortest possible rationales - snippets of an input text "responsible for" corresponding output - to explain the model prediction, with the assumption that shorter rationales are more intuitive to humans. However, this assumption has yet to be validated. Is the shortest rationale indeed the most human-understandable? To answer this question, we design a self-explaining model, LimitedInk, which allows users to extract rationales at any target length. Compared to existing baselines, LimitedInk achieves compatible end-task performance and human-annotated rationale agreement, making it a suitable representation of the recent class of self-explaining models. We use LimitedInk to conduct a user study on the impact of rationale length, where we ask human judges to predict the sentiment label of documents based only on LimitedInk-generated rationales with different lengths. We show rationales that are too short do not help humans predict labels better than randomly masked text, suggesting the need for more careful design of the best human rationales.

**Abstract:** Despite the success of large pre-trained language models (LMs) such as Codex, they show below-par performance on the larger and more complicated programming related questions. We show that LMs benefit from the summarized version of complicated questions. Our findings show that superfluous information often present in problem description such as human characters, background stories, names (which are included to help humans in understanding a task) does not help models in understanding a task. To this extent, we create a meta-dataset from the frequently used APPS dataset for the program synthesis task. Our meta-dataset consists of human and synthesized summary of the long and complicated programming questions. Experimental results on Codex show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline by 8.13% on an average in terms of strict accuracy. Our analysis shows that summary significantly improve performance for introductory (9.86%) and interview (11.48%) related programming questions. However, it shows improvement by a small margin (~2%) for competitive programming questions, implying the scope for future research direction.

**Abstract:** The ability to recognize analogies is fundamental to human cognition. Existing benchmarks to test word analogy do not reveal the underneath process of analogical reasoning of neural models. Holding the belief that models capable of reasoning should be right for the right reasons, we propose a first-of-its-kind Explainable Knowledge-intensive Analogical Reasoning benchmark (E-KAR). Our benchmark consists of 1,655 (in Chinese) and 1,251 (in English) problems sourced from the Civil Service Exams, which require intensive background knowledge to solve. More importantly, we design a free-text explanation scheme to explain whether an analogy should be drawn, and manually annotate them for each and every question and candidate answer. Empirical results suggest that this benchmark is very challenging for some state-of-the-art models for both explanation generation and analogical question answering tasks, which invites further research in this area.

**Abstract:** Sequence modeling has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on natural language and document understanding tasks. However, it is challenging to correctly serialize tokens in form-like documents in practice due to their variety of layout patterns. We propose FormNet, a structure-aware sequence model to mitigate the suboptimal serialization of forms. First, we design Rich Attention that leverages the spatial relationship between tokens in a form for more precise attention score calculation. Second, we construct Super-Tokens for each word by embedding representations from their neighboring tokens through graph convolutions. FormNet therefore explicitly recovers local syntactic information that may have been lost during serialization. In experiments, FormNet outperforms existing methods with a more compact model size and less pre-training data, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on CORD, FUNSD and Payment benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Within the human-robot interaction (HRI) community, many researchers have focused on the careful design of human-subjects studies. However, other parts of the community, e.g., the technical advances community, also need to do human-subjects studies to collect data to train their models, in ways that require user studies but without a strict experimental design. The design of such data collection is an underexplored area worthy of more attention. In this work, we contribute a clearly defined process to collect data with three steps for machine learning modeling purposes, grounded in recent literature, and detail an use of this process to facilitate the collection of a corpus of referring expressions. Specifically, we discuss our data collection goal and how we worked to encourage well-covered and abundant participant responses, through our design of the task environment, the task itself, and the study procedure. We hope this work would lead to more data collection formalism efforts in the HRI community and a fruitful discussion during the workshop.

**Abstract:** Research on the generalization ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has recently attracted a great deal of attention. However, due to their complex architectures and large numbers of parameters, measuring the generalization ability of specific DNN models remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose to use multiple factors to measure and rank the relative generalization of DNNs based on a new concept of confidence dimension (CD). Furthermore, we provide a feasible framework in our CD to theoretically calculate the upper bound of generalization based on the conventional Vapnik-Chervonenk dimension (VC-dimension) and Hoeffding's inequality. Experimental results on image classification and object detection demonstrate that our CD can reflect the relative generalization ability for different DNNs. In addition to full-precision DNNs, we also analyze the generalization ability of binary neural networks (BNNs), whose generalization ability remains an unsolved problem. Our CD yields a consistent and reliable measure and ranking for both full-precision DNNs and BNNs on all the tasks.

**Abstract:** Due to the limitations of the model structure and pre-training objectives, existing vision-and-language generation models cannot utilize pair-wise images and text through bi-directional generation. In this paper, we propose DU-VLG, a framework which unifies vision-and-language generation as sequence generation problems. DU-VLG is trained with novel dual pre-training tasks: multi-modal denoising autoencoder tasks and modality translation tasks. To bridge the gap between image understanding and generation, we further design a novel commitment loss. We compare pre-training objectives on image captioning and text-to-image generation datasets. Results show that DU-VLG yields better performance than variants trained with uni-directional generation objectives or the variant without the commitment loss. We also obtain higher scores compared to previous state-of-the-art systems on three vision-and-language generation tasks. In addition, human judges further confirm that our model generates real and relevant images as well as faithful and informative captions.

**Abstract:** Split computing distributes the execution of a neural network (e.g., for a classification task) between a mobile device and a more powerful edge server. A simple alternative to splitting the network is to carry out the supervised task purely on the edge server while compressing and transmitting the full data, and most approaches have barely outperformed this baseline. This paper proposes a new approach for discretizing and entropy-coding intermediate feature activations to efficiently transmit them from the mobile device to the edge server. We show that a efficient splittable network architecture results from a three-way tradeoff between (a) minimizing the computation on the mobile device, (b) minimizing the size of the data to be transmitted, and (c) maximizing the model's prediction performance. We propose an architecture based on this tradeoff and train the splittable network and entropy model in a knowledge distillation framework. In an extensive set of experiments involving three vision tasks, three datasets, nine baselines, and more than 180 trained models, we show that our approach improves supervised rate-distortion tradeoffs while maintaining a considerably smaller encoder size. We also release sc2bench, an installable Python package, to encourage and facilitate future studies on supervised compression for split computing (SC2).

**Abstract:** The density profiles of dark matter halos are typically modeled using empirical formulae fitted to the density profiles of relaxed halo populations. We present a neural network model that is trained to learn the mapping from the raw density field containing each halo to the dark matter density profile. We show that the model recovers the widely-used Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile out to the virial radius, and can additionally describe the variability in the outer profile of the halos. The neural network architecture consists of a supervised encoder-decoder framework, which first compresses the density inputs into a low-dimensional latent representation, and then outputs $Ï(r)$ for any desired value of radius $r$. The latent representation contains all the information used by the model to predict the density profiles. This allows us to interpret the latent representation by quantifying the mutual information between the representation and the halos' ground-truth density profiles. A two-dimensional representation is sufficient to accurately model the density profiles up to the virial radius; however, a three-dimensional representation is required to describe the outer profiles beyond the virial radius. The additional dimension in the representation contains information about the infalling material in the outer profiles of dark matter halos, thus discovering the splashback boundary of halos without prior knowledge of the halos' dynamical history.

**Abstract:** Boundaries are among the primary visual cues used by human and computer vision systems. One of the key problems in boundary detection is the label representation, which typically leads to class imbalance and, as a consequence, to thick boundaries that require non-differential post-processing steps to be thinned. In this paper, we re-interpret boundaries as 1-D surfaces and formulate a one-to-one vector transform function that allows for training of boundary prediction completely avoiding the class imbalance issue. Specifically, we define the boundary representation at any point as the unit vector pointing to the closest boundary surface. Our problem formulation leads to the estimation of direction as well as richer contextual information of the boundary, and, if desired, the availability of zero-pixel thin boundaries also at training time. Our method uses no hyper-parameter in the training loss and a fixed stable hyper-parameter at inference. We provide theoretical justification/discussions of the vector transform representation. We evaluate the proposed loss method using a standard architecture and show the excellent performance over other losses and representations on several datasets.

**Abstract:** Although many fields have witnessed the superior performance brought about by deep learning, the robustness of neural networks remains an open issue. Specifically, a small adversarial perturbation on the input may cause the model to produce a completely different output. Such poor robustness implies many potential hazards, especially in security-critical applications, e.g., autonomous driving and mobile robotics. This work studies what information the adversarially trained model focuses on. Empirically, we notice that the differences between the clean and adversarial data are mainly distributed in the low-frequency region. We then find that an adversarially-trained model is more robust than its naturally-trained counterpart due to the reason that the former pays more attention to learning the dominant information in low-frequency components. In addition, we consider two common ways to improve model robustness, namely, by data augmentation and by using stronger network architectures, and understand these techniques from a frequency-domain perspective. We are hopeful this work can shed light on the design of more robust neural networks.

**Abstract:** Objective: The next generation prosthetic hand that moves and feels like a real hand requires a robust neural interconnection between the human minds and machines. Methods: Here we present a neuroprosthetic system to demonstrate that principle by employing an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to translate the amputee's movement intent through a peripheral nerve interface. The AI agent is designed based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) and could simultaneously decode six degree-of-freedom (DOF) from multichannel nerve data in real-time. The decoder's performance is characterized in motor decoding experiments with three human amputees. Results: First, we show the AI agent enables amputees to intuitively control a prosthetic hand with individual finger and wrist movements up to 97-98% accuracy. Second, we demonstrate the AI agent's real-time performance by measuring the reaction time and information throughput in a hand gesture matching task. Third, we investigate the AI agent's long-term uses and show the decoder's robust predictive performance over a 16-month implant duration. Conclusion & significance: Our study demonstrates the potential of AI-enabled nerve technology, underling the next generation of dexterous and intuitive prosthetic hands.

**Abstract:** Simile interpretation is a crucial task in natural language processing. Nowadays, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many tasks. However, it remains under-explored whether PLMs can interpret similes or not. In this paper, we investigate the ability of PLMs in simile interpretation by designing a novel task named Simile Property Probing, i.e., to let the PLMs infer the shared properties of similes. We construct our simile property probing datasets from both general textual corpora and human-designed questions, containing 1,633 examples covering seven main categories. Our empirical study based on the constructed datasets shows that PLMs can infer similes' shared properties while still underperforming humans. To bridge the gap with human performance, we additionally design a knowledge-enhanced training objective by incorporating the simile knowledge into PLMs via knowledge embedding methods. Our method results in a gain of 8.58% in the probing task and 1.37% in the downstream task of sentiment classification. The datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Abbey4799/PLMs-Interpret-Simile.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a substantial step in better understanding the SOTA sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) pretraining for neural machine translation~(NMT). We focus on studying the impact of the jointly pretrained decoder, which is the main difference between Seq2Seq pretraining and previous encoder-based pretraining approaches for NMT. By carefully designing experiments on three language pairs, we find that Seq2Seq pretraining is a double-edged sword: On one hand, it helps NMT models to produce more diverse translations and reduce adequacy-related translation errors. On the other hand, the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the translation quality (i.e., domain discrepancy) and induce the over-estimation issue (i.e., objective discrepancy). Based on these observations, we further propose simple and effective strategies, named in-domain pretraining and input adaptation to remedy the domain and objective discrepancies, respectively. Experimental results on several language pairs show that our approach can consistently improve both translation performance and model robustness upon Seq2Seq pretraining.

**Abstract:** Graph Augmentation Learning (GAL) provides outstanding solutions for graph learning in handling incomplete data, noise data, etc. Numerous GAL methods have been proposed for graph-based applications such as social network analysis and traffic flow forecasting. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of these GAL methods are still unclear. As a consequence, how to choose optimal graph augmentation strategy for a certain application scenario is still in black box. There is a lack of systematic, comprehensive, and experimentally validated guideline of GAL for scholars. Therefore, in this survey, we in-depth review GAL techniques from macro (graph), meso (subgraph), and micro (node/edge) levels. We further detailedly illustrate how GAL enhance the data quality and the model performance. The aggregation mechanism of augmentation strategies and graph learning models are also discussed by different application scenarios, i.e., data-specific, model-specific, and hybrid scenarios. To better show the outperformance of GAL, we experimentally validate the effectiveness and adaptability of different GAL strategies in different downstream tasks. Finally, we share our insights on several open issues of GAL, including heterogeneity, spatio-temporal dynamics, scalability, and generalization.

**Abstract:** Recent machine reading comprehension datasets such as ReClor and LogiQA require performing logical reasoning over text. Conventional neural models are insufficient for logical reasoning, while symbolic reasoners cannot directly apply to text. To meet the challenge, we present a neural-symbolic approach which, to predict an answer, passes messages over a graph representing logical relations between text units. It incorporates an adaptive logic graph network (AdaLoGN) which adaptively infers logical relations to extend the graph and, essentially, realizes mutual and iterative reinforcement between neural and symbolic reasoning. We also implement a novel subgraph-to-node message passing mechanism to enhance context-option interaction for answering multiple-choice questions. Our approach shows promising results on ReClor and LogiQA.

**Abstract:** World Input-Output (I/O) matrices provide the networks of within- and cross-country economic relations. In the context of I/O analysis, the methodology adopted by national statistical offices in data collection raises the issue of obtaining reliable data in a timely fashion and it makes the reconstruction of (part of) the I/O matrices of particular interest. In this work, we propose a method combining hierarchical clustering and Matrix Completion (MC) with a LASSO-like nuclear norm penalty, to impute missing entries of a partially unknown I/O matrix. Through simulations based on synthetic matrices we study the effectiveness of the proposed method to predict missing values from both previous years data and current data related to countries similar to the one for which current data are obscured. To show the usefulness of our method, an application based on World Input-Output Database (WIOD) tables - which are an example of industry-by-industry I/O tables - is provided. Strong similarities in structure between WIOD and other I/O tables are also found, which make the proposed approach easily generalizable to them.

**Abstract:** Machine-vision-based defect classification techniques have been widely adopted for automatic quality inspection in manufacturing processes. This article describes a general framework for classifying defects from high volume data batches with efficient inspection of unlabelled samples. The concept is to construct a detector to identify new defect types, send them to the inspection station for labelling, and dynamically update the classifier in an efficient manner that reduces both storage and computational needs imposed by data samples of previously observed batches. Both a simulation study on image classification and a case study on surface defect detection via 3D point clouds are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** Existing knowledge-grounded dialogue systems typically use finetuned versions of a pretrained language model (LM) and large-scale knowledge bases. These models typically fail to generalize on topics outside of the knowledge base, and require maintaining separate potentially large checkpoints each time finetuning is needed. In this paper, we aim to address these limitations by leveraging the inherent knowledge stored in the pretrained LM as well as its powerful generation ability. We propose a multi-stage prompting approach to generate knowledgeable responses from a single pretrained LM. We first prompt the LM to generate knowledge based on the dialogue context. Then, we further prompt it to generate responses based on the dialogue context and the previously generated knowledge. Results show that our knowledge generator outperforms the state-of-the-art retrieval-based model by 5.8% when combining knowledge relevance and correctness. In addition, our multi-stage prompting outperforms the finetuning-based dialogue model in terms of response knowledgeability and engagement by up to 10% and 5%, respectively. Furthermore, we scale our model up to 530 billion parameters and show that larger LMs improve the generation correctness score by up to 10%, and response relevance, knowledgeability and engagement by up to 10%.

**Abstract:** The aim of online change-point detection is for a accurate, timely discovery of structural breaks. As data dimension outgrows the number of data in observation, online detection becomes challenging. Existing methods typically test only the change of mean, which omit the practical aspect of change of variance. We propose a complete graph-based, change-point detection algorithm to detect change of mean and variance from low to high-dimensional online data with a variable scanning window. Inspired by complete graph structure, we introduce graph-spanning ratios to map high-dimensional data into metrics, and then test statistically if a change of mean or change of variance occurs. Theoretical study shows that our approach has the desirable pivotal property and is powerful with prescribed error probabilities. We demonstrate that this framework outperforms other methods in terms of detection power. Our approach has high detection power with small and multiple scanning window, which allows timely detection of change-point in the online setting. Finally, we applied the method to financial data to detect change-points in S&P 500 stocks.

**Abstract:** Tuning of measurement models is challenging in real-world applications of sequential Monte Carlo methods. Recent advances in differentiable particle filters have led to various efforts to learn measurement models through neural networks. But existing approaches in the differentiable particle filter framework do not admit valid probability densities in constructing measurement models, leading to incorrect quantification of the measurement uncertainty given state information. We propose to learn expressive and valid probability densities in measurement models through conditional normalizing flows, to capture the complex likelihood of measurements given states. We show that the proposed approach leads to improved estimation performance and faster training convergence in a visual tracking experiment.

**Abstract:** Traditionally, Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims at deciding how to act optimally for an artificial agent. We argue that deciding when to act is equally important. As humans, we drift from default, instinctive or memorized behaviors to focused, thought-out behaviors when required by the situation. To enhance RL agents with this aptitude, we propose to augment the standard Markov Decision Process and make a new mode of action available: being lazy, which defers decision-making to a default policy. In addition, we penalize non-lazy actions in order to encourage minimal effort and have agents focus on critical decisions only. We name the resulting formalism lazy-MDPs. We study the theoretical properties of lazy-MDPs, expressing value functions and characterizing optimal solutions. Then we empirically demonstrate that policies learned in lazy-MDPs generally come with a form of interpretability: by construction, they show us the states where the agent takes control over the default policy. We deem those states and corresponding actions important since they explain the difference in performance between the default and the new, lazy policy. With suboptimal policies as default (pretrained or random), we observe that agents are able to get competitive performance in Atari games while only taking control in a limited subset of states.

**Abstract:** Emotion recognition technology through analyzing the EEG signal is currently an essential concept in Artificial Intelligence and holds great potential in emotional health care, human-computer interaction, multimedia content recommendation, etc. Though there have been several works devoted to reviewing EEG-based emotion recognition, the content of these reviews needs to be updated. In addition, those works are either fragmented in content or only focus on specific techniques adopted in this area but neglect the holistic perspective of the entire technical routes. Hence, in this paper, we review from the perspective of researchers who try to take the first step on this topic. We review the recent representative works in the EEG-based emotion recognition research and provide a tutorial to guide the researchers to start from the beginning. The scientific basis of EEG-based emotion recognition in the psychological and physiological levels is introduced. Further, we categorize these reviewed works into different technical routes and illustrate the theoretical basis and the research motivation, which will help the readers better understand why those techniques are studied and employed. At last, existing challenges and future investigations are also discussed in this paper, which guides the researchers to decide potential future research directions.

**Abstract:** Situation-aware technologies enabled by multiobject tracking (MOT) methods will create new services and applications in fields such as autonomous navigation and applied ocean sciences. Belief propagation (BP) is a state-of-the-art method for Bayesian MOT but fully relies on a statistical model and preprocessed sensor measurements. In this paper, we establish a hybrid method for model-based and data-driven MOT. The proposed neural enhanced belief propagation (NEBP) approach complements BP by information learned from raw sensor data with the goal to improve data association and to reject false alarm measurements. We evaluate the performance of our NEBP approach for MOT on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it can outperform state-of-the-art reference methods.

**Abstract:** Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) outputs translation while receiving the streaming source inputs, and hence needs a policy to determine where to start translating. The alignment between target and source words often implies the most informative source word for each target word, and hence provides the unified control over translation quality and latency, but unfortunately the existing SiMT methods do not explicitly model the alignment to perform the control. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Multi-head Attention (GMA) to develop a new SiMT policy by modeling alignment and translation in a unified manner. For SiMT policy, GMA models the aligned source position of each target word, and accordingly waits until its aligned position to start translating. To integrate the learning of alignment into the translation model, a Gaussian distribution centered on predicted aligned position is introduced as an alignment-related prior, which cooperates with translation-related soft attention to determine the final attention. Experiments on En-Vi and De-En tasks show that our method outperforms strong baselines on the trade-off between translation and latency.

**Abstract:** Balancing model complexity against the information contained in observed data is the central challenge to learning. In order for complexity-efficient models to exist and be discoverable in high dimensions, we require a computational framework that relates a credible notion of complexity to simple parameter representations. Further, this framework must allow excess complexity to be gradually removed via gradient-based optimization. Our n-ary, or n-argument, activation functions fill this gap by approximating belief functions (probabilistic Boolean logic) using logit representations of probability. Just as Boolean logic determines the truth of a consequent claim from relationships among a set of antecedent propositions, probabilistic formulations generalize predictions when antecedents, truth tables, and consequents all retain uncertainty. Our activation functions demonstrate the ability to learn arbitrary logic, such as the binary exclusive disjunction (p xor q) and ternary conditioned disjunction ( c ? p : q ), in a single layer using an activation function of matching or greater arity. Further, we represent belief tables using a basis that directly associates the number of nonzero parameters to the effective arity of the belief function, thus capturing a concrete relationship between logical complexity and efficient parameter representations. This opens optimization approaches to reduce logical complexity by inducing parameter sparsity.

**Abstract:** The assessment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) severity on knee X-rays is a central criteria for the use of total knee arthroplasty. However, this assessment suffers from imprecise standards and a remarkably high inter-reader variability. An algorithmic, automated assessment of KOA severity could improve overall outcomes of knee replacement procedures by increasing the appropriateness of its use. We propose a novel deep learning-based five-step algorithm to automatically grade KOA from posterior-anterior (PA) views of radiographs: (1) image preprocessing (2) localization of knees joints in the image using the YOLO v3-Tiny model, (3) initial assessment of the severity of osteoarthritis using a convolutional neural network-based classifier, (4) segmentation of the joints and calculation of the joint space narrowing (JSN), and (5), a combination of the JSN and the initial assessment to determine a final Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) score. Furthermore, by displaying the segmentation masks used to make the assessment, our algorithm demonstrates a higher degree of transparency compared to typical "black box" deep learning classifiers. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using two public datasets and one dataset from our institution, and show that our algorithm reaches state-of-the art performance. Moreover, we also collected ratings from multiple radiologists at our institution and showed that our algorithm performs at the radiologist level.

**Abstract:** Uncertainty estimation in deep learning has become a leading research field in medical image analysis due to the need for safe utilisation of AI algorithms in clinical practice. Most approaches for uncertainty estimation require sampling the network weights multiple times during testing or training multiple networks. This leads to higher training and testing costs in terms of time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose Layer Ensembles, a novel uncertainty estimation method that uses a single network and requires only a single pass to estimate predictive uncertainty of a network. Moreover, we introduce an image-level uncertainty metric, which is more beneficial for segmentation tasks compared to the commonly used pixel-wise metrics such as entropy and variance. We evaluate our approach on 2D and 3D, binary and multi-class medical image segmentation tasks. Our method shows competitive results with state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles, requiring only a single network and a single pass.

**Abstract:** The code smell is a sign of design and development flaws in a software system that reduces the reusability and maintainability of the system. Refactoring is done as an ongoing practice to remove the code smell from the program code. Among different code smells, the God class or Blob is one of the most common code smells. A god class contains too many responsibilities, violating object-oriented programming design's low coupling and high cohesiveness principles. This paper proposes an automatic approach to extracting a God class into multiple smaller classes with more specific responsibilities. To do this, we first construct a graph of methods (as nodes) for the concerning god class. The edge between any two methods is determined by their structural similarity, and the feature for each method is initialized using different semantic representation methods. Then, the variational graph auto-encoder is used to learn a vector representation for each method. Finally, the learned vectors are used to cluster methods into different groups to be recommended as refactored classes. We assessed the proposed framework using three different class cohesion metrics on sixteen actual God Classes collected from two well-known open-source systems. We also conducted a comparative study of our approach with a similar existing approach and found that the proposed approach generated better results for almost all the God Classes used in the experiment.

**Abstract:** In computer vision, pre-training models based on largescale supervised learning have been proven effective over the past few years. However, existing works mostly focus on learning from individual task with single data source (e.g., ImageNet for classification or COCO for detection). This restricted form limits their generalizability and usability due to the lack of vast semantic information from various tasks and data sources. Here, we demonstrate that jointly learning from heterogeneous tasks and multiple data sources contributes to universal visual representation, leading to better transferring results of various downstream tasks. Thus, learning how to bridge the gaps among different tasks and data sources is the key, but it still remains an open question. In this work, we propose a representation learning framework called X-Learner, which learns the universal feature of multiple vision tasks supervised by various sources, with expansion and squeeze stage: 1) Expansion Stage: X-Learner learns the task-specific feature to alleviate task interference and enrich the representation by reconciliation layer. 2) Squeeze Stage: X-Learner condenses the model to a reasonable size and learns the universal and generalizable representation for various tasks transferring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Learner achieves strong performance on different tasks without extra annotations, modalities and computational costs compared to existing representation learning methods. Notably, a single X-Learner model shows remarkable gains of 3.0%, 3.3% and 1.8% over current pretrained models on 12 downstream datasets for classification, object detection and semantic segmentation.

**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are very popular because of their high performance in various cognitive tasks in Machine Learning (ML). Recent advancements in DNNs have brought beyond human accuracy in many tasks, but at the cost of high computational complexity. To enable efficient execution of DNN inference, more and more research works, therefore, exploit the inherent error resilience of DNNs and employ Approximate Computing (AC) principles to address the elevated energy demands of DNN accelerators. This article provides a comprehensive survey and analysis of hardware approximation techniques for DNN accelerators. First, we analyze the state of the art and by identifying approximation families, we cluster the respective works with respect to the approximation type. Next, we analyze the complexity of the performed evaluations (with respect to the dataset and DNN size) to assess the efficiency, the potential, and limitations of approximate DNN accelerators. Moreover, a broad discussion is provided, regarding error metrics that are more suitable for designing approximate units for DNN accelerators as well as accuracy recovery approaches that are tailored to DNN inference. Finally, we present how Approximate Computing for DNN accelerators can go beyond energy efficiency and address reliability and security issues, as well.

**Abstract:** We establish a connection between tangles, a concept from structural graph theory that plays a central role in Robertson and Seymour's graph minor project, and hierarchical clustering. Tangles cannot only be defined for graphs, but in fact for arbitrary connectivity functions, which are functions defined on the subsets of some finite universe. In typical clustering applications these universes consist of points in some metric space. Connectivity functions are usually required to be submodular. It is our first contribution to show that the central duality theorem connecting tangles with hierarchical decompositions (so-called branch decompositions) also holds if submodularity is replaced by a different property that we call maximum-submodular. We then define a connectivity function on finite data sets in an arbitrary metric space and prove that its tangles are in one-to-one correspondence with the clusters obtained by applying the well-known single linkage clustering algorithms to the same data set. Lastly we generalize this correspondence for any hierarchical clustering. We show that the data structure that represents hierarchical clustering results, called dendograms, are equivalent to maximum-submodular connectivity functions and their tangles. The idea of viewing tangles as clusters has first been proposed by Diestel and Whittle in 2016 as an approach to image segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first that establishes a precise technical connection between tangles and clusters.

**Abstract:** Though robot learning is often formulated in terms of discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDPs), physical robots require near-continuous multiscale feedback control. Machines operate on multiple asynchronous sensing modalities, each with different frequencies, e.g., video frames at 30Hz, proprioceptive state at 100Hz, force-torque data at 500Hz, etc. While the classic approach is to batch observations into fixed-time windows then pass them through feed-forward encoders (e.g., with deep networks), we show that there exists a more elegant approach -- one that treats policy learning as modeling latent state dynamics in continuous-time. Specifically, we present 'InFuser', a unified architecture that trains continuous time-policies with Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs). InFuser evolves a single latent state representation over time by (In)tegrating and (Fus)ing multi-sensory observations (arriving at different frequencies), and inferring actions in continuous-time. This enables policies that can react to multi-frequency multi sensory feedback for truly end-to-end visuomotor control, without discrete-time assumptions. Behavior cloning experiments demonstrate that InFuser learns robust policies for dynamic tasks (e.g., swinging a ball into a cup) notably outperforming several baselines in settings where observations from one sensing modality can arrive at much sparser intervals than others.

**Abstract:** Non-line-of-sight reconstruction (NLoS) is a novel indirect imaging modality that aims to recover objects or scene parts outside the field of view from measurements of light that is indirectly scattered off a directly visible, diffuse wall. Despite recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction techniques, the well-posedness of the problem at large, and the recoverability of objects and their shapes in particular, remains an open question. The commonly employed Fermat path criterion is rather conservative with this regard, as it classifies some surfaces as unrecoverable, although they contribute to the signal.
  In this paper, we use a simpler necessary criterion for an opaque surface patch to be recoverable. Such piece of surface must be directly visible from some point on the wall, and it must occlude the space behind itself. Inspired by recent advances in neural implicit representations, we devise a new representation and reconstruction technique for NLoS scenes that unifies the treatment of recoverability with the reconstruction itself. Our approach, which we validate on various synthetic and experimental datasets, exhibits interesting properties. Unlike memory-inefficient volumetric representations, ours allows to infer adaptively tessellated surfaces from time-of-flight measurements of moderate resolution. It can further recover features beyond the Fermat path criterion, and it is robust to significant amounts of self-occlusion. We believe that this is the first time that these properties have been achieved in one system that, as an additional benefit, is trainable and hence suited for data-driven approaches.

**Abstract:** Bayesian optimization has been challenged by datasets with large-scale, high-dimensional, and non-stationary characteristics, which are common in real-world scenarios. Recent works attempt to handle such input by applying neural networks ahead of the classical Gaussian process to learn a latent representation. We show that even with proper network design, such learned representation often leads to collision in the latent space: two points with significantly different observations collide in the learned latent space, leading to degraded optimization performance. To address this issue, we propose LOCo, an efficient deep Bayesian optimization framework which employs a novel regularizer to reduce the collision in the learned latent space and encourage the mapping from the latent space to the objective value to be Lipschitz continuous. LOCo takes in pairs of data points and penalizes those too close in the latent space compared to their target space distance. We provide a rigorous theoretical justification for LOCo by inspecting the regret of this dynamic-embedding-based Bayesian optimization algorithm, where the neural network is iteratively retrained with the regularizer. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of LOCo on several synthetic and real-world benchmark Bayesian optimization tasks.

**Abstract:** Automated decision support systems that are able to infer second opinions from experts can potentially facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources; they can help decide when and from whom to seek a second opinion. In this paper, we look at the design of this type of support systems from the perspective of counterfactual inference. We focus on a multiclass classification setting and first show that, if experts make predictions on their own, the underlying causal mechanism generating their predictions needs to satisfy a desirable set invariant property. Further, we show that, for any causal mechanism satisfying this property, there exists an equivalent mechanism where the predictions by each expert are generated by independent sub-mechanisms governed by a common noise. This motivates the design of a set invariant Gumbel-Max structural causal model where the structure of the noise governing the sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive notion of similarity between experts which can be estimated from data. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our model can be used to infer second opinions more accurately than its non-causal counterpart.

**Abstract:** In video coding, in-loop filters are applied on reconstructed video frames to enhance their perceptual quality, before storing the frames for output. Conventional in-loop filters are obtained by hand-crafted methods. Recently, learned filters based on convolutional neural networks that utilize attention mechanisms have been shown to improve upon traditional techniques. However, these solutions are typically significantly more computationally expensive, limiting their potential for practical applications. The proposed method uses a novel combination of sparsity and structured pruning for complexity reduction of learned in-loop filters. This is done through a three-step training process of magnitude-guidedweight pruning, insignificant neuron identification and removal, and fine-tuning. Through initial tests we find that network parameters can be significantly reduced with a minimal impact on network performance.

We also cover a general overview of fundamental concepts that relate to IR imagery, such as IR radiation, IR detectors, IR optics and application fields. We analyse the statistical significance of the entire corpus from different perspectives. We believe that this survey will be a guideline for computer vision and artificial intelligence researchers that are interested in working with the spectra beyond the visible domain.

To alleviate these issues, we present LEVEN a large-scale Chinese LEgal eVENt detection dataset, with 8,116 legal documents and 150,977 human-annotated event mentions in 108 event types. Not only charge-related events, LEVEN also covers general events, which are critical for legal case understanding but neglected in existing LED datasets. To our knowledge, LEVEN is the largest LED dataset and has dozens of times the data scale of others, which shall significantly promote the training and evaluation of LED methods. The results of extensive experiments indicate that LED is challenging and needs further effort. Moreover, we simply utilize legal events as side information to promote downstream applications. The method achieves improvements of average 2.2 points precision in low-resource judgment prediction, and 1.5 points mean average precision in unsupervised case retrieval, which suggests the fundamentality of LED. The source code and dataset can be obtained from https://github.com/thunlp/LEVEN.

**Abstract:** Generating natural and informative texts has been a long-standing problem in NLP. Much effort has been dedicated into incorporating pre-trained language models (PLMs) with various open-world knowledge, such as knowledge graphs or wiki pages. However, their ability to access and manipulate the task-specific knowledge is still limited on downstream tasks, as this type of knowledge is usually not well covered in PLMs and is hard to acquire. To address the problem, we propose augmenting TExt Generation via Task-specific and Open-world Knowledge (TegTok) in a unified framework. Our model selects knowledge entries from two types of knowledge sources through dense retrieval and then injects them into the input encoding and output decoding stages respectively on the basis of PLMs. With the help of these two types of knowledge, our model can learn what and how to generate. Experiments on two text generation tasks of dialogue generation and question generation, and on two datasets show that our method achieves better performance than various baseline models.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a deep learning modular network for side-channel analysis. Our deep learning approach features the capability to exchange part of it (modules) with others networks. We aim to introduce reusable trained modules into side-channel analysis instead of building architectures for each evaluation, reducing the body of work when conducting those. Our experiments demonstrate that our architecture feasibly assesses a side-channel evaluation suggesting that learning transferability is possible with the network we propose in this paper.

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have demonstrated prominent capacities for image classification tasks in a closed set setting, where the test data come from the same distribution as the training data. However, in a more realistic open set scenario, traditional classifiers with incomplete knowledge cannot tackle test data that are not from the training classes. Open set recognition (OSR) aims to address this problem by both identifying unknown classes and distinguishing known classes simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to OSR that is based on the vision transformer (ViT) technique. Specifically, our approach employs two separate training stages. First, a ViT model is trained to perform closed set classification. Then, an additional detection head is attached to the embedded features extracted by the ViT, trained to force the representations of known data to class-specific clusters compactly. Test examples are identified as known or unknown based on their distance to the cluster centers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to leverage ViT for the purpose of OSR, and our extensive evaluation against several OSR benchmark datasets reveals that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods and obtains new state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Deep learning methods have been employed in gravitational-wave astronomy to accelerate the construction of surrogate waveforms for the inspiral of spin-aligned black hole binaries, among other applications. We demonstrate, that the residual error of an artificial neural network that models the coefficients of the surrogate waveform expansion (especially those of the phase of the waveform) has sufficient structure to be learnable by a second network. Adding this second network, we were able to reduce the maximum mismatch for waveforms in a validation set by more than an order of magnitude. We also explored several other ideas for improving the accuracy of the surrogate model, such as the exploitation of similarities between waveforms, the augmentation of the training set, the dissection of the input space, using dedicated networks per output coefficient and output augmentation. In several cases, small improvements can be observed, but the most significant improvement still comes from the addition of a second network that models the residual error. Since the residual error for more general surrogate waveform models (when e.g. eccentricity is included) may also have a specific structure, one can expect our method to be applicable to cases where the gain in accuracy could lead to significant gains in computational time.

**Abstract:** Accurate and efficient lumbar spine disease identification is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, existing deep learning models with millions of parameters often fail to learn with only hundreds or dozens of medical images. These models also ignore the contextual relationship between adjacent objects, such as between vertebras and intervertebral discs. This work introduces a multi-scale context-guided network with coarse-to-fine localization and classification, named CCF-Net, for lumbar spine disease identification. Specifically, in learning, we divide the localization objective into two parallel tasks, coarse and fine, which are more straightforward and effectively reduce the number of parameters and computational cost. The experimental results show that the coarse-to-fine design presents the potential to achieve high performance with fewer parameters and data requirements. Moreover, the multi-scale context-guided module can significantly improve the performance by 6.45% and 5.51% with ResNet18 and ResNet50, respectively.

**Abstract:** The Internet of Things (IoT) has been continuously rising in the past few years, and its potentials are now more apparent. However, transient data generation and limited energy resources are the major bottlenecks of these networks. Besides, minimum delay and other conventional quality of service measurements are still valid requirements to meet. An efficient caching policy can help meet the standard quality of service requirements while bypassing IoT networks' specific limitations. Adopting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms enables us to develop an effective caching scheme without the need for any prior knowledge or contextual information. In this work, we propose a DRL-based caching scheme that improves the cache hit rate and reduces energy consumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and limited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the regional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical architecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks. The results of comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the well-known conventional caching policies and an existing DRL-based solution in terms of cache hit rate and energy consumption of the IoT networks by considerable margins.

**Abstract:** Quantum density matrix represents all the information of the entire quantum system, and novel models of meaning employing density matrices naturally model linguistic phenomena such as hyponymy and linguistic ambiguity, among others in quantum question answering tasks. Naturally, we argue that applying the quantum density matrix into classical Question Answering (QA) tasks can show more effective performance. Specifically, we (i) design a new mechanism based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to accommodate the case when the inputs are matrixes; (ii) apply the new mechanism to QA problems with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and gain the LSTM-based QA model with the quantum density matrix. Experiments of our new model on TREC-QA and WIKI-QA data sets show encouraging results. Similarly, we argue that the quantum density matrix can also enhance the image feature information and the relationship between the features for the classical image classification. Thus, we (i) combine density matrices and CNN to design a new mechanism; (ii) apply the new mechanism to some representative classical image classification tasks. A series of experiments show that the application of quantum density matrix in image classification has the generalization and high efficiency on different datasets. The application of quantum density matrix both in classical question answering tasks and classical image classification tasks show more effective performance.

**Abstract:** Simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) starts translating while receiving the streaming source inputs, and hence the source sentence is always incomplete during translating. Different from the full-sentence MT using the conventional seq-to-seq architecture, SiMT often applies prefix-to-prefix architecture, which forces each target word to only align with a partial source prefix to adapt to the incomplete source in streaming inputs. However, the source words in the front positions are always illusoryly considered more important since they appear in more prefixes, resulting in position bias, which makes the model pay more attention on the front source positions in testing. In this paper, we first analyze the phenomenon of position bias in SiMT, and develop a Length-Aware Framework to reduce the position bias by bridging the structural gap between SiMT and full-sentence MT. Specifically, given the streaming inputs, we first predict the full-sentence length and then fill the future source position with positional encoding, thereby turning the streaming inputs into a pseudo full-sentence. The proposed framework can be integrated into most existing SiMT methods to further improve performance. Experiments on two representative SiMT methods, including the state-of-the-art adaptive policy, show that our method successfully reduces the position bias and thereby achieves better SiMT performance.

**Abstract:** Medical image segmentation has been so far achieving promising results with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, it is arguable that in traditional CNNs, its pooling layer tends to discard important information such as positions. Moreover, CNNs are sensitive to rotation and affine transformation. Capsule network is a data-efficient network design proposed to overcome such limitations by replacing pooling layers with dynamic routing and convolutional strides, which aims to preserve the part-whole relationships. Capsule network has shown a great performance in image recognition and natural language processing, but applications for medical image segmentation, particularly volumetric image segmentation, has been limited. In this work, we propose 3D-UCaps, a 3D voxel-based Capsule network for medical volumetric image segmentation. We build the concept of capsules into a CNN by designing a network with two pathways: the first pathway is encoded by 3D Capsule blocks, whereas the second pathway is decoded by 3D CNNs blocks. 3D-UCaps, therefore inherits the merits from both Capsule network to preserve the spatial relationship and CNNs to learn visual representation. We conducted experiments on various datasets to demonstrate the robustness of 3D-UCaps including iSeg-2017, LUNA16, Hippocampus, and Cardiac, where our method outperforms previous Capsule networks and 3D-Unets.

**Abstract:** Searching for the architecture cells is a dominant paradigm in NAS. However, little attention has been devoted to the analysis of the cell-based search spaces even though it is highly important for the continual development of NAS. In this work, we conduct an empirical post-hoc analysis of architectures from the popular cell-based search spaces and find that the existing search spaces contain a high degree of redundancy: the architecture performance is minimally sensitive to changes at large parts of the cells, and universally adopted designs, like the explicit search for a reduction cell, significantly increase the complexities but have very limited impact on the performance. Across architectures found by a diverse set of search strategies, we consistently find that the parts of the cells that do matter for architecture performance often follow similar and simple patterns. By explicitly constraining cells to include these patterns, randomly sampled architectures can match or even outperform the state of the art. These findings cast doubts into our ability to discover truly novel architectures in the existing cell-based search spaces, and inspire our suggestions for improvement to guide future NAS research.

**Abstract:** Despite the enormous success of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in many disciplines, the characterization of their computations and the origin of key properties such as generalization and robustness remain open questions. Recent literature suggests that robust networks with good generalization properties tend to be biased towards processing low frequencies in images. To explore the frequency bias hypothesis further, we develop an algorithm that allows us to learn modulatory masks highlighting the essential input frequencies needed for preserving a trained network's performance. We achieve this by imposing invariance in the loss with respect to such modulations in the input frequencies. We first use our method to test the low-frequency preference hypothesis of adversarially trained or data-augmented networks. Our results suggest that adversarially robust networks indeed exhibit a low-frequency bias but we find this bias is also dependent on directions in frequency space. However, this is not necessarily true for other types of data augmentation. Our results also indicate that the essential frequencies in question are effectively the ones used to achieve generalization in the first place. Surprisingly, images seen through these modulatory masks are not recognizable and resemble texture-like patterns.

**Abstract:** Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs; Garnelo et al., 2018a) are meta-learning models which leverage the flexibility of deep learning to produce well-calibrated predictions and naturally handle off-the-grid and missing data. CNPs scale to large datasets and train with ease. Due to these features, CNPs appear well-suited to tasks from environmental sciences or healthcare. Unfortunately, CNPs do not produce correlated predictions, making them fundamentally inappropriate for many estimation and decision making tasks. Predicting heat waves or floods, for example, requires modelling dependencies in temperature or precipitation over time and space. Existing approaches which model output dependencies, such as Neural Processes (NPs; Garnelo et al., 2018b) or the FullConvGNP (Bruinsma et al., 2021), are either complicated to train or prohibitively expensive. What is needed is an approach which provides dependent predictions, but is simple to train and computationally tractable. In this work, we present a new class of Neural Process models that make correlated predictions and support exact maximum likelihood training that is simple and scalable. We extend the proposed models by using invertible output transformations, to capture non-Gaussian output distributions. Our models can be used in downstream estimation tasks which require dependent function samples. By accounting for output dependencies, our models show improved predictive performance on a range of experiments with synthetic and real data.

**Abstract:** Existing model poisoning attacks to federated learning assume that an attacker has access to a large fraction of compromised genuine clients. However, such assumption is not realistic in production federated learning systems that involve millions of clients. In this work, we propose the first Model Poisoning Attack based on Fake clients called MPAF. Specifically, we assume the attacker injects fake clients to a federated learning system and sends carefully crafted fake local model updates to the cloud server during training, such that the learnt global model has low accuracy for many indiscriminate test inputs. Towards this goal, our attack drags the global model towards an attacker-chosen base model that has low accuracy. Specifically, in each round of federated learning, the fake clients craft fake local model updates that point to the base model and scale them up to amplify their impact before sending them to the cloud server. Our experiments show that MPAF can significantly decrease the test accuracy of the global model, even if classical defenses and norm clipping are adopted, highlighting the need for more advanced defenses.

This paper builds upon this work by introducing a novel algorithm which uses dampening and stacking to learn adversarial fair representations. Results show that that our algorithm improves upon earlier work in both censoring and reconstruction.

**Abstract:** We propose generative channel modeling to learn statistical channel models from channel input-output measurements. Generative channel models can learn more complicated distributions and represent the field data more faithfully. They are tractable and easy to sample from, which can potentially speed up the simulation rounds. To achieve this, we leverage advances in GAN, which helps us learn an implicit distribution over stochastic MIMO channels from observed measurements. In particular, our approach MIMO-GAN implicitly models the wireless channel as a distribution of time-domain band-limited impulse responses. We evaluate MIMO-GAN on 3GPP TDL MIMO channels and observe high-consistency in capturing power, delay and spatial correlation statistics of the underlying channel. In particular, we observe MIMO-GAN achieve errors of under 3.57 ns average delay and -18.7 dB power.

We use an encoder consisting of sequentially stacked gated MLP blocks, which accept 2D MFCCs as inputs.

The audio representations generated by our method are evaluated across a diverse set of benchmarks at the Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations (HEAR) challenge, hosted at the NeurIPS 2021 competition track. We achieved first place on the Speech Commands (full), Speech Commands (5 hours), and the Mridingham Tonic benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach is also the most resource-efficient among all the submitted methods, in terms of both the number of model parameters and the time required to compute embeddings.

**Abstract:** Speaker verification models that directly operate upon raw waveforms are receiving growing attention. However, their performances are less competitive than the state-of-the-art handcrafted feature-based counterparts, demonstrating equal error rates under 1% on the benchmark VoxCeleb1 evaluation protocol. In addition, they have yet not been explored with self-supervised learning frameworks. This paper proposes a new raw waveform speaker verification model that incorporates techniques proven effective for speaker verification, including the Res2Net backbone module and the aggregation method considering both context and channels. Under the best performing configuration, the model shows an equal error rate of 0.89%, competitive with state-of-the-art models. We also explore the proposed model with a self-supervised learning framework and show the state-of-the-art performance in this line of research. Finally, we show that leveraging the model trained with self-supervision successfully serves as a pre-trained model under the semi-supervised scenario where it is assumed that only a limited amount of data has a ground truth label and a bigger data has no label.

**Abstract:** Many studies have developed Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect Software Vulnerabilities (SVs) in functions and fine-grained code statements that cause such SVs. However, there is little work on leveraging such detection outputs for data-driven SV assessment to give information about exploitability, impact, and severity of SVs. The information is important to understand SVs and prioritize their fixing. Using large-scale data from 1,782 functions of 429 SVs in 200 real-world projects, we investigate ML models for automating function-level SV assessment tasks, i.e., predicting seven Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics. We particularly study the value and use of vulnerable statements as inputs for developing the assessment models because SVs in functions are originated in these statements. We show that vulnerable statements are 5.8 times smaller in size, yet exhibit 7.5-114.5% stronger assessment performance (Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)) than non-vulnerable statements. Incorporating context of vulnerable statements further increases the performance by up to 8.9% (0.64 MCC and 0.75 F1-Score). Overall, we provide the initial yet promising ML-based baselines for function-level SV assessment, paving the way for further research in this direction.

**Abstract:** Due to the partial observability and communication constraints in many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has become one of the most widely used MARL paradigms. In CTDE, centralized information is dedicated to learning the allocation of the team reward with a mixing network, while the learning of individual Q-values is usually based on local observations. The insufficient utility of global observation will degrade performance in challenging environments. To this end, this work proposes a novel Centralized Teacher with Decentralized Student (CTDS) framework, which consists of a teacher model and a student model. Specifically, the teacher model allocates the team reward by learning individual Q-values conditioned on global observation, while the student model utilizes the partial observations to approximate the Q-values estimated by the teacher model. In this way, CTDS balances the full utilization of global observation during training and the feasibility of decentralized execution for online inference. Our CTDS framework is generic which is ready to be applied upon existing CTDE methods to boost their performance. We conduct experiments on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks to test the effectiveness of our method and the results show that CTDS outperforms the existing value-based MARL methods.

**Abstract:** Cross-media retrieval of scientific and technological information is one of the important tasks in the cross-media study. Cross-media scientific and technological information retrieval obtain target information from massive multi-source and heterogeneous scientific and technological resources, which helps to design applications that meet users' needs, including scientific and technological information recommendation, personalized scientific and technological information retrieval, etc. The core of cross-media retrieval is to learn a common subspace, so that data from different media can be directly compared with each other after being mapped into this subspace. In subspace learning, existing methods often focus on modeling the discrimination of intra-media data and the invariance of inter-media data after mapping; however, they ignore the semantic consistency of inter-media data before and after mapping and media discrimination of intra-semantics data, which limit the result of cross-media retrieval. In light of this, we propose a scientific and technological information oriented Semantics-adversarial and Media-adversarial Cross-media Retrieval method (SMCR) to find an effective common subspace. Specifically, SMCR minimizes the loss of inter-media semantic consistency in addition to modeling intra-media semantic discrimination, to preserve semantic similarity before and after mapping. Furthermore, SMCR constructs a basic feature mapping network and a refined feature mapping network to jointly minimize the media discriminative loss within semantics, so as to enhance the feature mapping network's ability to confuse the media discriminant network. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed SMCR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-media retrieval.

**Abstract:** Learning to collaborate is critical in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A number of previous works promote collaboration by maximizing the correlation of agents' behaviors, which is typically characterised by mutual information (MI) in different forms. However, in this paper, we reveal that strong correlation can emerge from sub-optimal collaborative behaviors, and simply maximizing the MI can, surprisingly, hinder the learning towards better collaboration. To address this issue, we propose a novel MARL framework, called Progressive Mutual Information Collaboration (PMIC), for more effective MI-driven collaboration. In PMIC, we use a new collaboration criterion measured by the MI between global states and joint actions. Based on the criterion, the key idea of PMIC is maximizing the MI associated with superior collaborative behaviors and minimizing the MI associated with inferior ones. The two MI objectives play complementary roles by facilitating learning towards better collaborations while avoiding falling into sub-optimal ones. Specifically, PMIC stores and progressively maintains sets of superior and inferior interaction experiences, from which dual MI neural estimators are established. Experiments on a wide range of MARL benchmarks show the superior performance of PMIC compared with other algorithms.

**Abstract:** In the future, most companies will be confronted with the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and will have to decide on their strategy in this regards. Currently, a lot of companies are thinking about whether and how AI and the usage of data will impact their business model and what potential use cases could look like. One of the biggest challenges lies in coming up with innovative solution ideas with a clear business value. This requires business competencies on the one hand and technical competencies in AI and data analytics on the other hand. In this article, we present the concept of AI innovation labs and demonstrate a comprehensive framework, from coming up with the right ideas to incrementally implementing and evaluating them regarding their business value and their feasibility based on a company's capabilities. The concept is the result of nine years of working on data-driven innovations with companies from various domains. Furthermore, we share some lessons learned from its practical applications. Even though a lot of technical publications can be found in the literature regarding the development of AI models and many consultancy companies provide corresponding services for building AI innovations, we found very few publications sharing details about what an end-to-end framework could look like.

**Abstract:** Communication is an effective mechanism for coordinating the behavior of multiple agents. In the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning, agents can improve the overall learning performance and achieve their objectives by communication. Moreover, agents can communicate various types of messages, either to all agents or to specific agent groups, and through specific channels. With the growing body of research work in MARL with communication (Comm-MARL), there is lack of a systematic and structural approach to distinguish and classify existing Comm-MARL systems. In this paper, we survey recent works in the Comm-MARL field and consider various aspects of communication that can play a role in the design and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. With these aspects in mind, we propose several dimensions along which Comm-MARL systems can be analyzed, developed, and compared.

**Abstract:** HOLODEC, an airborne cloud particle imager, captures holographic images of a fixed volume of cloud to characterize the types and sizes of cloud particles, such as water droplets and ice crystals. Cloud particle properties include position, diameter, and shape. We present a hologram processing algorithm, HolodecML, that utilizes a neural segmentation model, GPUs, and computational parallelization. HolodecML is trained using synthetically generated holograms based on a model of the instrument, and predicts masks around particles found within reconstructed images. From these masks, the position and size of the detected particles can be characterized in three dimensions. In order to successfully process real holograms, we find we must apply a series of image corrupting transformations and noise to the synthetic images used in training.
  In this evaluation, HolodecML had comparable position and size estimation performance to the standard processing method, but improved particle detection by nearly 20\% on several thousand manually labeled HOLODEC images. However, the improvement only occurred when image corruption was performed on the simulated images during training, thereby mimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe. The trained model also learned to differentiate artifacts and other impurities in the HOLODEC images from the particles, even though no such objects were present in the training data set, while the standard processing method struggled to separate particles from artifacts. The novelty of the training approach, which leveraged noise as a means for parameterizing non-ideal aspects of the HOLODEC detector, could be applied in other domains where the theoretical model is incapable of fully describing the real-world operation of the instrument and accurate truth data required for supervised learning cannot be obtained from real-world observations.

**Abstract:** The efficient, automated search for well-performing neural architectures (NAS) has drawn increasing attention in the recent past. Thereby, the predominant research objective is to reduce the necessity of costly evaluations of neural architectures while efficiently exploring large search spaces. To this aim, surrogate models embed architectures in a latent space and predict their performance, while generative models for neural architectures enable optimization-based search within the latent space the generator draws from. Both, surrogate and generative models, have the aim of facilitating query-efficient search in a well-structured latent space. In this paper, we further improve the trade-off between query-efficiency and promising architecture generation by leveraging advantages from both, efficient surrogate models and generative design. To this end, we propose a generative model, paired with a surrogate predictor, that iteratively learns to generate samples from increasingly promising latent subspaces. This approach leads to very effective and efficient architecture search, while keeping the query amount low. In addition, our approach allows in a straightforward manner to jointly optimize for multiple objectives such as accuracy and hardware latency. We show the benefit of this approach not only w.r.t. the optimization of architectures for highest classification accuracy but also in the context of hardware constraints and outperform state-of-the art methods on several NAS benchmarks for single and multiple objectives. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet.
