**Abstract:** In many regions of the world, sparse data on key economic outcomes inhibits the development, targeting, and evaluation of public policy. We demonstrate how advancements in satellite imagery and machine learning can help ameliorate these data and inference challenges. In the context of an expansion of the electrical grid across Uganda, we show how a combination of satellite imagery and computer vision can be used to develop local-level livelihood measurements appropriate for inferring the causal impact of electricity access on livelihoods. We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by 0.17 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate over our study period relative to untreated areas. Our results provide country-scale evidence on the impact of a key infrastructure investment, and provide a low-cost, generalizable approach to future policy evaluation in data sparse environments.

**Abstract:** Many of the challenges facing today's reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, such as robustness, generalization, transfer, and computational efficiency are closely related to compression. Prior work has convincingly argued why minimizing information is useful in the supervised learning setting, but standard RL algorithms lack an explicit mechanism for compression. The RL setting is unique because (1) its sequential nature allows an agent to use past information to avoid looking at future observations and (2) the agent can optimize its behavior to prefer states where decision making requires few bits. We take advantage of these properties to propose a method (RPC) for learning simple policies. This method brings together ideas from information bottlenecks, model-based RL, and bits-back coding into a simple and theoretically-justified algorithm. Our method jointly optimizes a latent-space model and policy to be self-consistent, such that the policy avoids states where the model is inaccurate. We demonstrate that our method achieves much tighter compression than prior methods, achieving up to 5x higher reward than a standard information bottleneck. We also demonstrate that our method learns policies that are more robust and generalize better to new tasks.

**Abstract:** Vector space models for symbolic processing that encode symbols by random vectors have been proposed in cognitive science and connectionist communities under the names Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA), and, synonymously, Hyperdimensional (HD) computing. In this paper, we generalize VSAs to function spaces by mapping continuous-valued data into a vector space such that the inner product between the representations of any two data points represents a similarity kernel. By analogy to VSA, we call this new function encoding and computing framework Vector Function Architecture (VFA). In VFAs, vectors can represent individual data points as well as elements of a function space (a reproducing kernel Hilbert space). The algebraic vector operations, inherited from VSA, correspond to well-defined operations in function space. Furthermore, we study a previously proposed method for encoding continuous data, fractional power encoding (FPE), which uses exponentiation of a random base vector to produce randomized representations of data points and fulfills the kernel properties for inducing a VFA. We show that the distribution from which elements of the base vector are sampled determines the shape of the FPE kernel, which in turn induces a VFA for computing with band-limited functions. In particular, VFAs provide an algebraic framework for implementing large-scale kernel machines with random features, extending Rahimi and Recht, 2007. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of VFA models to problems in image recognition, density estimation and nonlinear regression. Our analyses and results suggest that VFAs constitute a powerful new framework for representing and manipulating functions in distributed neural systems, with myriad applications in artificial intelligence.

**Abstract:** Human visual perception carves a scene at its physical joints, decomposing the world into objects, which are selectively attended, tracked, and predicted as we engage our surroundings. Object representations emancipate perception from the sensory input, enabling us to keep in mind that which is out of sight and to use perceptual content as a basis for action and symbolic cognition. Human behavioral studies have documented how object representations emerge through grouping, amodal completion, proto-objects, and object files. Deep neural network (DNN) models of visual object recognition, by contrast, remain largely tethered to the sensory input, despite achieving human-level performance at labeling objects. Here, we review related work in both fields and examine how these fields can help each other. The cognitive literature provides a starting point for the development of new experimental tasks that reveal mechanisms of human object perception and serve as benchmarks driving development of deep neural network models that will put the object into object recognition.

**Abstract:** High-quality, large-scale datasets have played a crucial role in the development and success of classical machine learning. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a new field that aims to use quantum computers for data analysis, with the hope of obtaining a quantum advantage of some sort. While most proposed QML architectures are benchmarked using classical datasets, there is still doubt whether QML on classical datasets will achieve such an advantage. In this work, we argue that one should instead employ quantum datasets composed of quantum states. For this purpose, we introduce the NTangled dataset composed of quantum states with different amounts and types of multipartite entanglement. We first show how a quantum neural network can be trained to generate the states in the NTangled dataset. Then, we use the NTangled dataset to benchmark QML models for supervised learning classification tasks. We also consider an alternative entanglement-based dataset, which is scalable and is composed of states prepared by quantum circuits with different depths. As a byproduct of our results, we introduce a novel method for generating multipartite entangled states, providing a use-case of quantum neural networks for quantum entanglement theory.

**Abstract:** Speech pre-training has primarily demonstrated efficacy on classification tasks, while its capability of generating novel speech, similar to how GPT-2 can generate coherent paragraphs, has barely been explored. Generative Spoken Language Modeling (GSLM) (Lakhotia et al., 2021) is the only prior work addressing the generative aspects of speech pre-training, which replaces text with discovered phone-like units for language modeling and shows the ability to generate meaningful novel sentences. Unfortunately, despite eliminating the need of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information. Hence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not generate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative spoken language model (pGSLM). It is composed of a multi-stream transformer language model (MS-TLM) of speech, represented as discovered unit and prosodic feature streams, and an adapted HiFi-GAN model converting MS-TLM outputs to waveforms. We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation, and re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling. Experimental results show that the pGSLM can utilize prosody to improve both prosody and content modeling, and also generate natural, meaningful, and coherent speech given a spoken prompt.

**Abstract:** Sentence embedding refers to a set of effective and versatile techniques for converting raw text into numerical vector representations that can be used in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications. The majority of these techniques are either supervised or unsupervised. Compared to the unsupervised methods, the supervised ones make less assumptions about optimization objectives and usually achieve better results. However, the training requires a large amount of labeled sentence pairs, which is not available in many industrial scenarios. To that end, we propose a generic and end-to-end approach -- PAUSE (Positive and Annealed Unlabeled Sentence Embedding), capable of learning high-quality sentence embeddings from a partially labeled dataset. We experimentally show that PAUSE achieves, and sometimes surpasses, state-of-the-art results using only a small fraction of labeled sentence pairs on various benchmark tasks. When applied to a real industrial use case where labeled samples are scarce, PAUSE encourages us to extend our dataset without the liability of extensive manual annotation work.

**Abstract:** The examination of histopathology images is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis and stratification of cancer patients. A key challenge in the analysis of such images is their size, which can run into the gigapixels and can require tedious screening by clinicians. With the recent advances in computational medicine, automatic tools have been proposed to assist clinicians in their everyday practice. Such tools typically process these large images by slicing them into tiles that can then be encoded and utilized for different clinical models. In this study, we propose a novel generative framework that can learn powerful representations for such tiles by learning to plausibly expand their visual field. In particular, we developed a progressively grown generative model with the objective of visual field expansion. Thus trained, our model learns to generate different tissue types with fine details, while simultaneously learning powerful representations that can be used for different clinical endpoints, all in a self-supervised way. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted classification experiments on CAMELYON17 and CRC benchmark datasets, comparing favorably to other self-supervised and pre-trained strategies that are commonly used in digital pathology. Our code is available at https://github.com/jcboyd/cdpath21-gan.

**Abstract:** Training sample re-weighting is an effective approach for tackling data biases such as imbalanced and corrupted labels. Recent methods develop learning-based algorithms to learn sample re-weighting strategies jointly with model training based on the frameworks of reinforcement learning and meta learning. However, depending on additional unbiased reward data is limiting their general applicability. Furthermore, existing learning-based sample re-weighting methods require nested optimizations of models and weighting parameters, which requires expensive second-order computation. This paper addresses these two problems and presents a novel learning-based fast sample re-weighting (FSR) method that does not require additional reward data. The method is based on two key ideas: learning from history to build proxy reward data and feature sharing to reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show the proposed method achieves competitive results compared to state of the arts on label noise robustness and long-tailed recognition, and does so while achieving significantly improved training efficiency. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ieg.

**Abstract:** Spoken question answering (SQA) requires fine-grained understanding of both spoken documents and questions for the optimal answer prediction. In this paper, we propose novel training schemes for spoken question answering with a self-supervised training stage and a contrastive representation learning stage. In the self-supervised stage, we propose three auxiliary self-supervised tasks, including utterance restoration, utterance insertion, and question discrimination, and jointly train the model to capture consistency and coherence among speech documents without any additional data or annotations. We then propose to learn noise-invariant utterance representations in a contrastive objective by adopting multiple augmentation strategies, including span deletion and span substitution. Besides, we design a Temporal-Alignment attention to semantically align the speech-text clues in the learned common space and benefit the SQA tasks. By this means, the training schemes can more effectively guide the generation model to predict more proper answers. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three SQA benchmarks.

**Abstract:** Recent studies on compression of pretrained language models (e.g., BERT) usually use preserved accuracy as the metric for evaluation. In this paper, we propose two new metrics, label loyalty and probability loyalty that measure how closely a compressed model (i.e., student) mimics the original model (i.e., teacher). We also explore the effect of compression with regard to robustness under adversarial attacks. We benchmark quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation and progressive module replacing with loyalty and robustness. By combining multiple compression techniques, we provide a practical strategy to achieve better accuracy, loyalty and robustness.

**Abstract:** Math word problem (MWP) is a challenging and critical task in natural language processing. Many recent studies formalize MWP as a generation task and have adopted sequence-to-sequence models to transform problem descriptions to mathematical expressions. However, mathematical expressions are prone to minor mistakes while the generation objective does not explicitly handle such mistakes. To address this limitation, we devise a new ranking task for MWP and propose Generate & Rank, a multi-task framework based on a generative pre-trained language model. By joint training with generation and ranking, the model learns from its own mistakes and is able to distinguish between correct and incorrect expressions. Meanwhile, we perform tree-based disturbance specially designed for MWP and an online update to boost the ranker. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the benchmark and the results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in all datasets. Particularly, in the classical Math23k, our method is 7% (78.4% $\rightarrow$ 85.4%) higher than the state-of-the-art.

**Abstract:** Label noise will degenerate the performance of deep learning algorithms because deep neural networks easily overfit label errors. Let X and Y denote the instance and clean label, respectively. When Y is a cause of X, according to which many datasets have been constructed, e.g., SVHN and CIFAR, the distributions of P(X) and P(Y|X) are entangled. This means that the unsupervised instances are helpful to learn the classifier and thus reduce the side effect of label noise. However, it remains elusive on how to exploit the causal information to handle the label noise problem. In this paper, by leveraging a structural causal model, we propose a novel generative approach for instance-dependent label-noise learning. In particular, we show that properly modeling the instances will contribute to the identifiability of the label noise transition matrix and thus lead to a better classifier. Empirically, our method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world label-noise datasets.

**Abstract:** Given the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in various domains, it is promising to explore the application of its methods to the development of intelligent and autonomous cyber agents. Enabling this development requires a representative RL training environment. To that end, this work presents CyGIL: an experimental testbed of an emulated RL training environment for network cyber operations. CyGIL uses a stateless environment architecture and incorporates the MITRE ATT&CK framework to establish a high fidelity training environment, while presenting a sufficiently abstracted interface to enable RL training. Its comprehensive action space and flexible game design allow the agent training to focus on particular advanced persistent threat (APT) profiles, and to incorporate a broad range of potential threats and vulnerabilities. By striking a balance between fidelity and simplicity, it aims to leverage state of the art RL algorithms for application to real-world cyber defence.

**Abstract:** Conversational search systems, such as Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana, provide a new search paradigm where users are allowed, via natural language dialogues, to communicate with search systems. Evaluating such systems is very challenging since search results are presented in the format of natural language sentences. Given the unlimited number of possible responses, collecting relevance assessments for all the possible responses is infeasible. In this paper, we propose POSSCORE, a simple yet effective automatic evaluation method for conversational search. The proposed embedding-based metric takes the influence of part of speech (POS) of the terms in the response into account. To the best knowledge, our work is the first to systematically demonstrate the importance of incorporating syntactic information, such as POS labels, for conversational search evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our metrics can correlate with human preference, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline metrics.

**Abstract:** We introduce semiparametric Bayesian networks that combine parametric and nonparametric conditional probability distributions. Their aim is to incorporate the advantages of both components: the bounded complexity of parametric models and the flexibility of nonparametric ones. We demonstrate that semiparametric Bayesian networks generalize two well-known types of Bayesian networks: Gaussian Bayesian networks and kernel density estimation Bayesian networks. For this purpose, we consider two different conditional probability distributions required in a semiparametric Bayesian network. In addition, we present modifications of two well-known algorithms (greedy hill-climbing and PC) to learn the structure of a semiparametric Bayesian network from data. To realize this, we employ a score function based on cross-validation. In addition, using a validation dataset, we apply an early-stopping criterion to avoid overfitting. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, we conduct an exhaustive experiment on synthetic data sampled by mixing linear and nonlinear functions, multivariate normal data sampled from Gaussian Bayesian networks, real data from the UCI repository, and bearings degradation data. As a result of this experiment, we conclude that the proposed algorithm accurately learns the combination of parametric and nonparametric components, while achieving a performance comparable with those provided by state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** We study Comparative Preference Classification (CPC) which aims at predicting whether a preference comparison exists between two entities in a given sentence and, if so, which entity is preferred over the other. High-quality CPC models can significantly benefit applications such as comparative question answering and review-based recommendations. Among the existing approaches, non-deep learning methods suffer from inferior performances. The state-of-the-art graph neural network-based ED-GAT (Ma et al., 2020) only considers syntactic information while ignoring the critical semantic relations and the sentiments to the compared entities. We proposed sentiment Analysis Enhanced COmparative Network (SAECON) which improves CPC ac-curacy with a sentiment analyzer that learns sentiments to individual entities via domain adaptive knowledge transfer. Experiments on the CompSent-19 (Panchenko et al., 2019) dataset present a significant improvement on the F1 scores over the best existing CPC approaches.

<p>

**Abstract:** Building compositional explanations requires models to combine two or more facts that, together, describe why the answer to a question is correct. Typically, these "multi-hop" explanations are evaluated relative to one (or a small number of) gold explanations. In this work, we show these evaluations substantially underestimate model performance, both in terms of the relevance of included facts, as well as the completeness of model-generated explanations, because models regularly discover and produce valid explanations that are different than gold explanations. To address this, we construct a large corpus of 126k domain-expert (science teacher) relevance ratings that augment a corpus of explanations to standardized science exam questions, discovering 80k additional relevant facts not rated as gold. We build three strong models based on different methodologies (generation, ranking, and schemas), and empirically show that while expert-augmented ratings provide better estimates of explanation quality, both original (gold) and expert-augmented automatic evaluations still substantially underestimate performance by up to 36% when compared with full manual expert judgements, with different models being disproportionately affected. This poses a significant methodological challenge to accurately evaluating explanations produced by compositional reasoning models.

**Abstract:** Malignant melanoma is a common skin cancer that is mostly curable before metastasis -when growths spawn in organs away from the original site. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer if left untreated due to the high risk of metastasis. This paper presents Melatect, a machine learning (ML) model embedded in an iOS app that identifies potential malignant melanoma. Melatect accurately classifies lesions as malignant or benign over 96.6% of the time with no apparent bias or overfitting. Using the Melatect app, users have the ability to take pictures of skin lesions (moles) and subsequently receive a mole classification. The Melatect app provides a convenient way to get free advice on lesions and track these lesions over time. A recursive computer image analysis algorithm and modified MLOps pipeline was developed to create a model that performs at a higher accuracy than existing models. Our training dataset included 18,400 images of benign and malignant lesions, including 18,000 from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive, as well as 400 images gathered from local dermatologists; these images were augmented using DeepAugment, an AutoML tool, to 54,054 images.

**Abstract:** Odometer has been proven to significantly improve the accuracy of the Global Navigation Satellite System / Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) integrated vehicle navigation in GNSS-challenged environments. However, the odometer is inaccessible in many applications, especially for aftermarket devices. To apply forward speed aiding without hardware wheeled odometer, we propose OdoNet, an untethered one-dimensional Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based pseudo-odometer model learning from a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which can act as an alternative to the wheeled odometer. Dedicated experiments have been conducted to verify the feasibility and robustness of the OdoNet. The results indicate that the IMU individuality, the vehicle loads, and the road conditions have little impact on the robustness and precision of the OdoNet, while the IMU biases and the mounting angles may notably ruin the OdoNet. Thus, a data-cleaning procedure is added to effectively mitigate the impacts of the IMU biases and the mounting angles. Compared to the process using only non-holonomic constraint (NHC), after employing the pseudo-odometer, the positioning error is reduced by around 68%, while the percentage is around 74% for the hardware wheeled odometer. In conclusion, the proposed OdoNet can be employed as an untethered pseudo-odometer for vehicle navigation, which can efficiently improve the accuracy and reliability of the positioning in GNSS-denied environments.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel approach to learn visually grounded meaning representations of words as low-dimensional node embeddings on an underlying graph hierarchy. The lower level of the hierarchy models modality-specific word representations through dedicated but communicating graphs, while the higher level puts these representations together on a single graph to learn a representation jointly from both modalities. The topology of each graph models similarity relations among words, and is estimated jointly with the graph embedding. The assumption underlying this model is that words sharing similar meaning correspond to communities in an underlying similarity graph in a low-dimensional space. We named this model Hierarchical Multi-Modal Similarity Graph Embedding (HM-SGE). Experimental results validate the ability of HM-SGE to simulate human similarity judgements and concept categorization, outperforming the state of the art.

**Abstract:** Learning robust models that generalize well under changes in the data distribution is critical for real-world applications. To this end, there has been a growing surge of interest to learn simultaneously from multiple training domains -- while enforcing different types of invariance across those domains. Yet, all existing approaches fail to show systematic benefits under controlled evaluation protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new regularization -- named Fishr -- that enforces domain invariance in the space of the gradients of the loss: specifically, the domain-level variances of gradients are matched across training domains. Our approach is based on the close relations between the gradient covariance, the Fisher Information and the Hessian of the loss: in particular, we show that Fishr eventually aligns the domain-level loss landscapes locally around the final weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Fishr for out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, Fishr improves the state of the art on the DomainBed benchmark and performs consistently better than Empirical Risk Minimization. The code is released at https://github.com/alexrame/fishr.

**Abstract:** Prescriptive process monitoring is a family of techniques to optimize the performance of a business process by triggering interventions at runtime. Existing prescriptive process monitoring techniques assume that the number of interventions that may be triggered is unbounded. In practice, though, specific interventions consume resources with finite capacity. For example, in a loan origination process, an intervention may consist of preparing an alternative loan offer to increase the applicant's chances of taking a loan. This intervention requires a certain amount of time from a credit officer, and thus, it is not possible to trigger this intervention in all cases. This paper proposes a prescriptive process monitoring technique that triggers interventions to optimize a cost function under fixed resource constraints. The proposed technique relies on predictive modeling to identify cases that are likely to lead to a negative outcome, in combination with causal inference to estimate the effect of an intervention on the outcome of the case. These outputs are then used to allocate resources to interventions to maximize a cost function. A preliminary empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed approach produces a higher net gain than a purely predictive (non-causal) baseline.

**Abstract:** Compliments and concerns in reviews are valuable for understanding users' shopping interests and their opinions with respect to specific aspects of certain items. Existing review-based recommenders favor large and complex language encoders that can only learn latent and uninterpretable text representations. They lack explicit user attention and item property modeling, which however could provide valuable information beyond the ability to recommend items. Therefore, we propose a tightly coupled two-stage approach, including an Aspect-Sentiment Pair Extractor (ASPE) and an Attention-Property-aware Rating Estimator (APRE). Unsupervised ASPE mines Aspect-Sentiment pairs (AS-pairs) and APRE predicts ratings using AS-pairs as concrete aspect-level evidence. Extensive experiments on seven real-world Amazon Review Datasets demonstrate that ASPE can effectively extract AS-pairs which enable APRE to deliver superior accuracy over the leading baselines.

**Abstract:** With the rapid development of intelligent detection algorithms based on deep learning, much progress has been made in automatic road defect recognition and road marking parsing. This can effectively address the issue of an expensive and time-consuming process for professional inspectors to review the street manually. Towards this goal, we present RoadAtlas, a novel end-to-end integrated system that can support 1) road defect detection, 2) road marking parsing, 3) a web-based dashboard for presenting and inputting data by users, and 4) a backend containing a well-structured database and developed APIs.

**Abstract:** Reproducing results in publications by distributing publicly available source code is becoming ever more popular. Given the difficulty of reproducing machine learning (ML) experiments, there have been significant efforts in reducing the variance of these results. As in any science, the ability to consistently reproduce results effectively strengthens the underlying hypothesis of the work, and thus, should be regarded as important as the novel aspect of the research itself. The contribution of this work is a framework that is able to reproduce consistent results and provides a means of easily creating, training, and evaluating natural language processing (NLP) deep learning (DL) models.

**Abstract:** Empirically multidimensional discriminator (critic) output can be advantageous, while a solid explanation for it has not been discussed. In this paper, (i) we rigorously prove that high-dimensional critic output has advantage on distinguishing real and fake distributions; (ii) we also introduce an square-root velocity transformation (SRVT) block which further magnifies this advantage. The proof is based on our proposed maximal p-centrality discrepancy which is bounded above by p-Wasserstein distance and perfectly fits the Wasserstein GAN framework with high-dimensional critic output n. We have also showed when n = 1, the proposed discrepancy is equivalent to 1-Wasserstein distance. The SRVT block is applied to break the symmetric structure of high-dimensional critic output and improve the generalization capability of the discriminator network. In terms of implementation, the proposed framework does not require additional hyper-parameter tuning, which largely facilitates its usage. Experiments on image generation tasks show performance improvement on benchmark datasets.

**Abstract:** Minwise hashing (MinHash) is an important and practical algorithm for generating random hashes to approximate the Jaccard (resemblance) similarity in massive binary (0/1) data. The basic theory of MinHash requires applying hundreds or even thousands of independent random permutations to each data vector in the dataset, in order to obtain reliable results for (e.g.,) building large-scale learning models or approximate near neighbor search in massive data. In this paper, we propose {\bf Circulant MinHash (C-MinHash)} and provide the surprising theoretical results that we just need \textbf{two} independent random permutations. For C-MinHash, we first conduct an initial permutation on the data vector, then we use a second permutation to generate hash values. Basically, the second permutation is re-used $K$ times via circulant shifting to produce $K$ hashes. Unlike classical MinHash, these $K$ hashes are obviously correlated, but we are able to provide rigorous proofs that we still obtain an unbiased estimate of the Jaccard similarity and the theoretical variance is uniformly smaller than that of the classical MinHash with $K$ independent permutations. The theoretical proofs of C-MinHash require some non-trivial efforts. Numerical experiments are conducted to justify the theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of C-MinHash.

**Abstract:** Existing generative pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT) focus on modeling the language structure and semantics of general texts. However, those models do not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement estimation). In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance.

**Abstract:** The study of functional brain connectivity (FC) is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms of many psychiatric disorders. Many recent analyses adopt graph convolutional networks, to study non-linear interactions between functionally-correlated states. However, although patterns of brain activation are known to be hierarchically organised in both space and time, many methods have failed to extract powerful spatio-temporal features. To overcome those challenges, and improve understanding of long-range functional dynamics, we translate an approach, from the domain of skeleton-based action recognition, designed to model interactions across space and time. We evaluate this approach using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on sex classification and fluid intelligence prediction. To account for subject topographic variability of functional organisation, we modelled functional connectomes using multi-resolution dual-regressed (subject-specific) ICA nodes. Results show a prediction accuracy of 94.4% for sex classification (an increase of 6.2% compared to other methods), and an improvement of correlation with fluid intelligence of 0.325 vs 0.144, relative to a baseline model that encodes space and time separately. Results suggest that explicit encoding of spatio-temporal dynamics of brain functional activity may improve the precision with which behavioural and cognitive phenotypes may be predicted in the future.

**Abstract:** One challenge for dialogue agents is to recognize feelings of the conversation partner and respond accordingly. In this work, RoBERTa-GPT2 is proposed for empathetic dialogue generation, where the pre-trained auto-encoding RoBERTa is utilised as encoder and the pre-trained auto-regressive GPT-2 as decoder. With the combination of the pre-trained RoBERTa and GPT-2, our model realizes a new state-of-the-art emotion accuracy. To enable the empathetic ability of RoBERTa-GPT2 model, we propose a commonsense knowledge and emotional concepts extractor, in which the commonsensible and emotional concepts of dialogue context are extracted for the GPT-2 decoder. The experiment results demonstrate that the empathetic dialogue generation benefits from both pre-trained encoder-decoder architecture and external knowledge.

**Abstract:** Convolutional sparse coding improves on the standard sparse approximation by incorporating a global shift-invariant model. The most efficient convolutional sparse coding methods are based on the alternating direction method of multipliers and the convolution theorem. The only major difference between these methods is how they approach a convolutional least-squares fitting subproblem. This letter presents a solution to this subproblem, which improves the efficiency of the state-of-the-art algorithms. We also use the same approach for developing an efficient convolutional dictionary learning method. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm for convolutional sparse coding with a constraint on the approximation error.

**Abstract:** Online hate speech has caught everyone's attention from the news related to the COVID-19 pandemic, US elections, and worldwide protests. Online toxicity - an umbrella term for online hateful behavior, manifests itself in forms such as online hate speech. Hate speech is a deliberate attack directed towards an individual or a group motivated by the targeted entity's identity or opinions. The rising mass communication through social media further exacerbates the harmful consequences of online hate speech. While there has been significant research on hate-speech identification using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the work on utilizing NLP for prevention and intervention of online hate speech lacks relatively. This paper presents a holistic conceptual framework on hate-speech NLP countering methods along with a thorough survey on the current progress of NLP for countering online hate speech. It classifies the countering techniques based on their time of action, and identifies potential future research areas on this topic.

In addition, the training speed and evaluation performance of naturalness model are improved by transfer learning from quality and informativeness linguistic knowledge.

**Abstract:** In this paper we present IndicBART, a multilingual, sequence-to-sequence pre-trained model focusing on 11 Indic languages and English. Different from existing pre-trained models, IndicBART utilizes the orthographic similarity between Indic scripts to improve transfer learning between similar Indic languages. We evaluate IndicBART on two NLG tasks: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and extreme summarization. Our experiments on NMT for 12 language pairs and extreme summarization for 7 languages using multilingual fine-tuning show that IndicBART is competitive with or better than mBART50 despite containing significantly fewer parameters. Our analyses focus on identifying the impact of script unification (to Devanagari), corpora size as well as multilingualism on the final performance.

**Abstract:** Many real-world data can be represented as heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes and connections. Heterogeneous graph neural network model aims to embed nodes or subgraphs into low-dimensional vector space for various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, etc. Although several models were proposed recently, they either only aggregate information from the same type of neighbors, or just indiscriminately treat homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors in the same way. Based on these observations, we propose a new heterogeneous graph neural network model named HMSG to comprehensively capture structural, semantic and attribute information from both homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. Specifically, we first decompose the heterogeneous graph into multiple metapath-based homogeneous and heterogeneous subgraphs, and each subgraph associates specific semantic and structural information. Then message aggregation methods are applied to each subgraph independently, so that information can be learned in a more targeted and efficient manner. Through a type-specific attribute transformation, node attributes can also be transferred among different types of nodes. Finally, we fuse information from subgraphs together to get the complete representation. Extensive experiments on several datasets for node classification, node clustering and link prediction tasks show that HMSG achieves the best performance in all evaluation metrics than state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** The identification of out-of-distribution data is vital to the deployment of classification networks. For example, a generic neural network that has been trained to differentiate between images of dogs and cats can only classify an input as either a dog or a cat. If a picture of a car or a kumquat were to be supplied to this classifier, the result would still be either a dog or a cat. In order to mitigate this, techniques such as the neural network watchdog have been developed. The compression of the image input into the latent layer of the autoencoder defines the region of in-distribution in the image space. This in-distribution set of input data has a corresponding boundary in the image space. The watchdog assesses whether inputs are in inside or outside this boundary. This paper demonstrates how to sharpen this boundary using generative network training data augmentation thereby bettering the discrimination and overall performance of the watchdog.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate a new image processing methodology for resolving gas bubbles travelling through liquid metal from dynamic neutron radiography images with intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio. Image pre-processing, denoising and bubble segmentation are described in detail, with practical recommendations. Experimental validation is presented - stationary and moving reference bodies with neutron-transparent cavities are radiographed with imaging conditions similar to the cases with bubbles in liquid metal. The new methods are applied to our experimental data from previous and recent imaging campaigns, and the performance of the methods proposed in this paper is compared against our previously developed methods. Significant improvements are observed as well as the capacity to reliably extract physically meaningful information from measurements performed under highly adverse imaging conditions. The showcased image processing solution and separate elements thereof are readily extendable beyond the present application, and have been made open-source.

**Abstract:** The Wasserstein barycenter has been widely studied in various fields, including natural language processing, and computer vision. However, it requires a high computational cost to solve the Wasserstein barycenter problem because the computation of the Wasserstein distance requires a quadratic time with respect to the number of supports. By contrast, the Wasserstein distance on a tree, called the tree-Wasserstein distance, can be computed in linear time and allows for the fast comparison of a large number of distributions. In this study, we propose a barycenter under the tree-Wasserstein distance, called the fixed support tree-Wasserstein barycenter (FS-TWB) and its extension, called the fixed support tree-sliced Wasserstein barycenter (FS-TSWB). More specifically, we first show that the FS-TWB and FS-TSWB problems are convex optimization problems and can be solved by using the projected subgradient descent. Moreover, we propose a more efficient algorithm to compute the subgradient and objective function value by using the properties of tree-Wasserstein barycenter problems. Through real-world experiments, we show that, by using the proposed algorithm, the FS-TWB and FS-TSWB can be solved two orders of magnitude faster than the original Wasserstein barycenter.

**Abstract:** Existing question answering (QA) datasets are created mainly for the application of having AI to be able to answer questions asked by humans. But in educational applications, teachers and parents sometimes may not know what questions they should ask a child that can maximize their language learning results. With a newly released book QA dataset (FairytaleQA), which educational experts labeled on 46 fairytale storybooks for early childhood readers, we developed an automated QA generation model architecture for this novel application. Our model (1) extracts candidate answers from a given storybook passage through carefully designed heuristics based on a pedagogical framework; (2) generates appropriate questions corresponding to each extracted answer using a language model; and, (3) uses another QA model to rank top QA-pairs. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate that our method can help with the scarcity issue of the children's book QA dataset via data augmentation on 200 unlabeled storybooks.

**Abstract:** Identifying important actors (or nodes) in a two-mode network often remains a crucial challenge in mining, analyzing, and interpreting real-world networks. While traditional bipartite centrality indices are often used to recognize key nodes that influence the network information flow, they frequently produce poor results in intricate situations such as massive networks with complex local structures or a lack of complete knowledge about the network topology and certain properties. In this paper, we introduce Bi-face (BF), a new bipartite centrality measurement for identifying important nodes in two-mode networks. Using the powerful mathematical formalism of Formal Concept Analysis, the BF measure exploits the faces of concept intents to identify nodes that have influential bicliques connectivity and are not located in irrelevant bridges. Unlike off-the shelf centrality indices, it quantifies how a node has a cohesive-substructure influence on its neighbour nodes via bicliques while not being in network core-peripheral ones through its absence from non-influential bridges. Our experiments on several real-world and synthetic networks show the efficiency of BF over existing prominent bipartite centrality measures such as betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and vote-rank among others.

**Abstract:** We outline the role of forward and inverse modelling approaches in the design of human--computer interaction systems. Causal, forward models tend to be easier to specify and simulate, but HCI requires solutions of the inverse problem. We infer finger 3D position $(x,y,z)$ and pose (pitch and yaw) on a mobile device using capacitive sensors which can sense the finger up to 5cm above the screen. We use machine learning to develop data-driven models to infer position, pose and sensor readings, based on training data from: 1. data generated by robots, 2. data from electrostatic simulators 3. human-generated data. Machine learned emulation is used to accelerate the electrostatic simulation performance by a factor of millions. We combine a Conditional Variational Autoencoder with domain expertise/models experimentally collected data. We compare forward and inverse model approaches to direct inference of finger pose. The combination gives the most accurate reported results on inferring 3D position and pose with a capacitive sensor on a mobile device.

**Abstract:** The emergence of Industry 4.0 is making production systems more flexible and also more dynamic. In these settings, schedules often need to be adapted in real-time by dispatching rules. Although substantial progress was made until the '90s, the performance of these rules is still rather limited. The machine learning literature is developing a variety of methods to improve them, but the resulting rules are difficult to interpret and do not generalise well for a wide range of settings. This paper is the first major attempt at combining machine learning with domain problem reasoning for scheduling. The idea consists of using the insights obtained with the latter to guide the empirical search of the former. Our hypothesis is that this guided empirical learning process should result in dispatching rules that are effective and interpretable and which generalise well to different instance classes. We test our approach in the classical dynamic job shop scheduling problem minimising tardiness, which is one of the most well-studied scheduling problems. Nonetheless, results suggest that our approach was able to find new state-of-the-art rules, which significantly outperform the existing literature in the vast majority of settings, from loose to tight due dates and from low utilisation conditions to congested shops. Overall, the average improvement is 19%. Moreover, the rules are compact, interpretable, and generalise well to extreme, unseen scenarios.

**Abstract:** Despite having been studied to a great extent, the task of conditional generation of sequences of frames, or videos, remains extremely challenging. It is a common belief that a key step towards solving this task resides in modelling accurately both spatial and temporal information in video signals. A promising direction to do so has been to learn latent variable models that predict the future in latent space and project back to pixels, as suggested in recent literature. Following this line of work and building on top of a family of models introduced in prior work, Neural ODE, we investigate an approach that models time-continuous dynamics over a continuous latent space with a differential equation with respect to time. The intuition behind this approach is that these trajectories in latent space could then be extrapolated to generate video frames beyond the time steps for which the model is trained. We show that our approach yields promising results in the task of future frame prediction on the Moving MNIST dataset with 1 and 2 digits.

<p>

**Abstract:** Purpose: Although recent deep energy-based generative models (EBMs) have shown encouraging results in many image generation tasks, how to take advantage of the self-adversarial cogitation in deep EBMs to boost the performance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is still desired.
  Methods: With the successful application of deep learning in a wide range of MRI reconstruction, a line of emerging research involves formulating an optimization-based reconstruction method in the space of a generative model. Leveraging this, a novel regularization strategy is introduced in this article which takes advantage of self-adversarial cogitation of the deep energy-based model. More precisely, we advocate for alternative learning a more powerful energy-based model with maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the deep energy-based information, represented as image prior. Simultaneously, implicit inference with Langevin dynamics is a unique property of re-construction. In contrast to other generative models for reconstruction, the proposed method utilizes deep energy-based information as the image prior in reconstruction to improve the quality of image.
  Results: Experiment results that imply the proposed technique can obtain remarkable performance in terms of high reconstruction accuracy that is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, and does not suffer from mode collapse.
  Conclusion: Algorithmically, an iterative approach was presented to strengthen EBM training with the gradient of energy network. The robustness and the reproducibility of the algorithm were also experimentally validated. More importantly, the proposed reconstruction framework can be generalized for most MRI reconstruction scenarios.

**Abstract:** The data scarcity problem in Electroencephalography (EEG) based affective computing results into difficulty in building an effective model with high accuracy and stability using machine learning algorithms especially deep learning models. Data augmentation has recently achieved considerable performance improvement for deep learning models: increased accuracy, stability, and reduced over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework, namely Generative Adversarial Network-based Self-supervised Data Augmentation (GANSER). As the first to combine adversarial training with self-supervised learning for EEG-based emotion recognition, the proposed framework can generate high-quality and high-diversity simulated EEG samples. In particular, we utilize adversarial training to learn an EEG generator and force the generated EEG signals to approximate the distribution of real samples, ensuring the quality of augmented samples. A transformation function is employed to mask parts of EEG signals and force the generator to synthesize potential EEG signals based on the remaining parts, to produce a wide variety of samples. The masking possibility during transformation is introduced as prior knowledge to guide to extract distinguishable features for simulated EEG signals and generalize the classifier to the augmented sample space. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method can help emotion recognition for performance gain and achieve state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** To enable safe and efficient use of multi-robot systems in everyday life, a robust and fast method for coordinating their actions must be developed. In this paper, we present a distributed task allocation and scheduling algorithm for missions where the tasks of different robots are tightly coupled with temporal and precedence constraints. The approach is based on representing the problem as a variant of the vehicle routing problem, and the solution is found using a distributed metaheuristic algorithm based on evolutionary computation (CBM-pop). Such an approach allows a fast and near-optimal allocation and can therefore be used for online replanning in case of task changes. Simulation results show that the approach has better computational speed and scalability without loss of optimality compared to the state-of-the-art distributed methods. An application of the planning procedure to a practical use case of a greenhouse maintained by a multi-robot system is given.

**Abstract:** Sequential diagnosis prediction on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been proven crucial for predictive analytics in the medical domain. EHR data, sequential records of a patient's interactions with healthcare systems, has numerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data insufficiency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making use of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to irregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from hospital, and insufficient data. To mitigate this, we propose an end-to-end robust transformer-based model called SETOR, which exploits neural ordinary differential equation to handle both irregular intervals between a patient's visits with admitted timestamps and length of stay in each visit, to alleviate the limitation of insufficient data by integrating medical ontology, and to capture the dependencies between the patient's visits by employing multi-layer transformer blocks. Experiments conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets show that, our sequential diagnoses prediction model SETOR not only achieves better predictive results than previous state-of-the-art approaches, irrespective of sufficient or insufficient training data, but also derives more interpretable embeddings of medical codes. The experimental codes are available at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Xueping/SETOR).

**Abstract:** 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted for airway segmentation. The performance of 3D CNNs is greatly influenced by the dataset while the public airway datasets are mainly clean CT scans with coarse annotation, thus difficult to be generalized to noisy CT scans (e.g. COVID-19 CT scans). In this work, we proposed a new dual-stream network to address the variability between the clean domain and noisy domain, which utilizes the clean CT scans and a small amount of labeled noisy CT scans for airway segmentation. We designed two different encoders to extract the transferable clean features and the unique noisy features separately, followed by two independent decoders. Further on, the transferable features are refined by the channel-wise feature recalibration and Signed Distance Map (SDM) regression. The feature recalibration module emphasizes critical features and the SDM pays more attention to the bronchi, which is beneficial to extracting the transferable topological features robust to the coarse labels. Extensive experimental results demonstrated the obvious improvement brought by our proposed method. Compared to other state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, our method accurately segmented more bronchi in the noisy CT scans.

**Abstract:** Blockchains are gaining momentum due to the interest of industries and people in \emph{decentralized applications} (Dapps), particularly in those for trading assets through digital certificates secured on blockchain, called tokens. As a consequence, providing a clear unambiguous description of any activities carried out on blockchains has become crucial, and we feel the urgency to achieve that description at least for trading. This paper reports on how to leverage the \emph{Ontology for Agents, Systems, and Integration of Services} ("\ONT{}") as a general means for the semantic representation of smart contracts stored on blockchain as software agents. Special attention is paid to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), whose management through the ERC721 standard is presented as a case study.

**Abstract:** In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, one of the key questions is how to deal with the high noise level existing in physical quantum bits (qubits). Quantum error correction is promising but requires an extensive number (e.g., over 1,000) of physical qubits to create one "perfect" qubit, exceeding the capacity of the existing quantum computers. This paper aims to tackle the noise issue from another angle: instead of creating perfect qubits for general quantum algorithms, we investigate the potential to mitigate the noise issue for dedicate algorithms. Specifically, this paper targets quantum neural network (QNN), and proposes to learn the errors in the training phase, so that the identified QNN model can be resilient to noise. As a result, the implementation of QNN needs no or a small number of additional physical qubits, which is more realistic for the near-term quantum computers. To achieve this goal, an application-specific compiler is essential: on the one hand, the error cannot be learned if the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits exists randomness; on the other hand, the compiler needs to be efficient so that the lengthy training procedure can be completed in a reasonable time. In this paper, we utilize the recent QNN framework, QuantumFlow, as a case study. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can optimize QNN models for different errors in qubits, achieving up to 28% accuracy improvement compared with the model obtained by the error-agnostic training.

**Abstract:** Internet of Things devices have seen a rapid growth and popularity in recent years with many more ordinary devices gaining network capability and becoming part of the ever growing IoT network. With this exponential growth and the limitation of resources, it is becoming increasingly harder to protect against security threats such as malware due to its evolving faster than the defence mechanisms can handle with. The traditional security systems are not able to detect unknown malware as they use signature-based methods. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by introducing a novel IoT malware traffic analysis approach using neural network and binary visualisation. The prime motivation of the proposed approach is to faster detect and classify new malware (zero-day malware). The experiment results show that our method can satisfy the accuracy requirement of practical application.

**Abstract:** We define and establish the conditions for `equivalent neural networks' - neural networks with different weights, biases, and threshold functions that result in the same associated function. We prove that given a neural network $\mathcal{N}$ with piece-wise linear activation, the space of coefficients describing all equivalent neural networks is given by a semialgebraic set. This result is obtained by studying different representations of a given piece-wise linear function using the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem.

**Abstract:** In this study, we propose the convolutional recurrent neural network and transfer learning (CRNNTL) for QSAR modelling. The method was inspired by the applications of polyphonic sound detection and electrocardiogram classification. Our strategy takes advantages of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks for feature extraction, as well as the data augmentation method. Herein, CRNNTL is evaluated on 20 benchmark datasets in comparison with baseline methods. In addition, one isomers based dataset is used to elucidate its ability for both local and global feature extraction. Then, knowledge transfer performance of CRNNTL is tested, especially for small biological activity datasets. Finally, different latent representations from other type of AEs were used for versatility study of our model. The results show the effectiveness of CRNNTL using different latent representation. Moreover, efficient knowledge transfer is achieved to overcome data scarcity considering binding site similarity between different targets.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a Perceptual Learned Video Compression (PLVC) approach with recurrent conditional generative adversarial network. In our approach, the recurrent auto-encoder-based generator learns to fully explore the temporal correlation for compressing video. More importantly, we propose a recurrent conditional discriminator, which judges raw and compressed video conditioned on both spatial and temporal information, including the latent representation, temporal motion and hidden states in recurrent cells. This way, in the adversarial training, it pushes the generated video to be not only spatially photo-realistic but also temporally consistent with groundtruth and coherent among video frames. The experimental results show that the proposed PLVC model learns to compress video towards good perceptual quality at low bit-rate, and outperforms the previous traditional and learned approaches on several perceptual quality metrics. The user study further validates the outstanding perceptual performance of PLVC in comparison with the latest learned video compression approaches and the official HEVC test model (HM 16.20). The codes will be released at https://github.com/RenYang-home/PLVC.

**Abstract:** Operational networks are increasingly using machine learning models for a variety of tasks, including detecting anomalies, inferring application performance, and forecasting demand. Accurate models are important, yet accuracy can degrade over time due to concept drift, whereby either the characteristics of the data change over time (data drift) or the relationship between the features and the target predictor change over time (model drift). Drift is important to detect because changes in properties of the underlying data or relationships to the target prediction can require model retraining, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Concept drift occurs in operational networks for a variety of reasons, ranging from software upgrades to seasonality to changes in user behavior. Yet, despite the prevalence of drift in networks, its extent and effects on prediction accuracy have not been extensively studied. This paper presents an initial exploration into concept drift in a large cellular network in the United States for a major metropolitan area in the context of demand forecasting. We find that concept drift arises largely due to data drift, and it appears across different key performance indicators (KPIs), models, training set sizes, and time intervals. We identify the sources of concept drift for the particular problem of forecasting downlink volume. Weekly and seasonal patterns introduce both high and low-frequency model drift, while disasters and upgrades result in sudden drift due to exogenous shocks. Regions with high population density, lower traffic volumes, and higher speeds also tend to correlate with more concept drift. The features that contribute most significantly to concept drift are User Equipment (UE) downlink packets, UE uplink packets, and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) total received packets.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose the BioNetExplorer framework to systematically generate and explore multiple DNN architectures for bio-signal processing in wearables. Our framework adapts key neural architecture parameters to search for an embedded DNN with a low hardware overhead, which can be deployed in wearable edge devices to analyse the bio-signal data and to extract the relevant information, such as arrhythmia and seizure. Our framework also enables hardware-aware DNN architecture search using genetic algorithms by imposing user requirements and hardware constraints (storage, FLOPs, etc.) during the exploration stage, thereby limiting the number of networks explored. Moreover, BioNetExplorer can also be used to search for DNNs based on the user-required output classes; for instance, a user might require a specific output class due to genetic predisposition or a pre-existing heart condition. The use of genetic algorithms reduces the exploration time, on average, by 9x, compared to exhaustive exploration. We are successful in identifying Pareto-optimal designs, which can reduce the storage overhead of the DNN by ~30MB for a quality loss of less than 0.5%. To enable low-cost embedded DNNs, BioNetExplorer also employs different model compression techniques to further reduce the storage overhead of the network by up to 53x for a quality loss of <0.2%.

**Abstract:** It is widely believed that the perceptual system of an organism is optimized for the properties of the environment to which it is exposed. A specific instance of this principle known as the Infomax principle holds that the purpose of early perceptual processing is to maximize the mutual information between the neural coding and the incoming sensory signal. In this article, we present a method to implement this principle accurately with a local, spike-based, and continuous-time learning rule.
