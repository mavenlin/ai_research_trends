**Abstract:** We investigate the capability of a transformer pretrained on natural language to generalize to other modalities with minimal finetuning -- in particular, without finetuning of the self-attention and feedforward layers of the residual blocks. We consider such a model, which we call a Frozen Pretrained Transformer (FPT), and study finetuning it on a variety of sequence classification tasks spanning numerical computation, vision, and protein fold prediction. In contrast to prior works which investigate finetuning on the same modality as the pretraining dataset, we show that pretraining on natural language can improve performance and compute efficiency on non-language downstream tasks. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the architecture, comparing the performance of a random initialized transformer to a random LSTM. Combining the two insights, we find language-pretrained transformers can obtain strong performance on a variety of non-language tasks.

**Abstract:** We present NeX, a new approach to novel view synthesis based on enhancements of multiplane image (MPI) that can reproduce next-level view-dependent effects -- in real time. Unlike traditional MPI that uses a set of simple RGB$Î±$ planes, our technique models view-dependent effects by instead parameterizing each pixel as a linear combination of basis functions learned from a neural network. Moreover, we propose a hybrid implicit-explicit modeling strategy that improves upon fine detail and produces state-of-the-art results. Our method is evaluated on benchmark forward-facing datasets as well as our newly-introduced dataset designed to test the limit of view-dependent modeling with significantly more challenging effects such as rainbow reflections on a CD. Our method achieves the best overall scores across all major metrics on these datasets with more than 1000$\times$ faster rendering time than the state of the art.

**Abstract:** Building agents capable of understanding language instructions is critical to effective and robust human-AI collaboration. Recent work focuses on training these agents via reinforcement learning in environments with synthetic language; however, instructions often define long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks, and learning policies requires many episodes of experience. We introduce ELLA: Exploration through Learned Language Abstraction, a reward shaping approach geared towards boosting sample efficiency in sparse reward environments by correlating high-level instructions with simpler low-level constituents. ELLA has two key elements: 1) A termination classifier that identifies when agents complete low-level instructions, and 2) A relevance classifier that correlates low-level instructions with success on high-level tasks. We learn the termination classifier offline from pairs of instructions and terminal states. Notably, in departure from prior work in language and abstraction, we learn the relevance classifier online, without relying on an explicit decomposition of high-level instructions to low-level instructions. On a suite of complex BabyAI environments with varying instruction complexities and reward sparsity, ELLA shows gains in sample efficiency relative to language-based shaping and traditional RL methods.

**Abstract:** Several of the latest GAN-based vocoders show remarkable achievements, outperforming autoregressive and flow-based competitors in both qualitative and quantitative measures while synthesizing orders of magnitude faster. In this work, we hypothesize that the common factor underlying their success is the multi-resolution discriminating framework, not the minute details in architecture, loss function, or training strategy. We experimentally test the hypothesis by evaluating six different generators paired with one shared multi-resolution discriminating framework. For all evaluative measures with respect to text-to-speech syntheses and for all perceptual metrics, their performances are not distinguishable from one another, which supports our hypothesis.

**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a challenging program induction dataset that was recently proposed by Chollet (2019). Here, we report the first set of results collected from a behavioral study of humans solving a subset of tasks from ARC (40 out of 1000). Although this subset of tasks contains considerable variation, our results showed that humans were able to infer the underlying program and generate the correct test output for a novel test input example, with an average of 80% of tasks solved per participant, and with 65% of tasks being solved by more than 80% of participants. Additionally, we find interesting patterns of behavioral consistency and variability within the action sequences during the generation process, the natural language descriptions to describe the transformations for each task, and the errors people made. Our findings suggest that people can quickly and reliably determine the relevant features and properties of a task to compose a correct solution. Future modeling work could incorporate these findings, potentially by connecting the natural language descriptions we collected here to the underlying semantics of ARC.

**Abstract:** The rapid progress of photorealistic synthesis techniques has reached at a critical point where the boundary between real and manipulated images starts to blur. Thus, benchmarking and advancing digital forgery analysis have become a pressing issue. However, existing face forgery datasets either have limited diversity or only support coarse-grained analysis. To counter this emerging threat, we construct the ForgeryNet dataset, an extremely large face forgery dataset with unified annotations in image- and video-level data across four tasks: 1) Image Forgery Classification, including two-way (real / fake), three-way (real / fake with identity-replaced forgery approaches / fake with identity-remained forgery approaches), and n-way (real and 15 respective forgery approaches) classification. 2) Spatial Forgery Localization, which segments the manipulated area of fake images compared to their corresponding source real images. 3) Video Forgery Classification, which re-defines the video-level forgery classification with manipulated frames in random positions. This task is important because attackers in real world are free to manipulate any target frame. and 4) Temporal Forgery Localization, to localize the temporal segments which are manipulated. ForgeryNet is by far the largest publicly available deep face forgery dataset in terms of data-scale (2.9 million images, 221,247 videos), manipulations (7 image-level approaches, 8 video-level approaches), perturbations (36 independent and more mixed perturbations) and annotations (6.3 million classification labels, 2.9 million manipulated area annotations and 221,247 temporal forgery segment labels). We perform extensive benchmarking and studies of existing face forensics methods and obtain several valuable observations.

**Abstract:** Training machine learning (ML) models typically involves expensive iterative optimization. Once the model's final parameters are released, there is currently no mechanism for the entity which trained the model to prove that these parameters were indeed the result of this optimization procedure. Such a mechanism would support security of ML applications in several ways. For instance, it would simplify ownership resolution when multiple parties contest ownership of a specific model. It would also facilitate the distributed training across untrusted workers where Byzantine workers might otherwise mount a denial-of-service by returning incorrect model updates.
  In this paper, we remediate this problem by introducing the concept of proof-of-learning in ML. Inspired by research on both proof-of-work and verified computations, we observe how a seminal training algorithm, stochastic gradient descent, accumulates secret information due to its stochasticity. This produces a natural construction for a proof-of-learning which demonstrates that a party has expended the compute require to obtain a set of model parameters correctly. In particular, our analyses and experiments show that an adversary seeking to illegitimately manufacture a proof-of-learning needs to perform *at least* as much work than is needed for gradient descent itself.
  We also instantiate a concrete proof-of-learning mechanism in both of the scenarios described above. In model ownership resolution, it protects the intellectual property of models released publicly. In distributed training, it preserves availability of the training procedure. Our empirical evaluation validates that our proof-of-learning mechanism is robust to variance induced by the hardware (ML accelerators) and software stacks.

**Abstract:** We introduce a new framework for sample-efficient model evaluation that we call active testing. While approaches like active learning reduce the number of labels needed for model training, existing literature largely ignores the cost of labeling test data, typically unrealistically assuming large test sets for model evaluation. This creates a disconnect to real applications, where test labels are important and just as expensive, e.g. for optimizing hyperparameters. Active testing addresses this by carefully selecting the test points to label, ensuring model evaluation is sample-efficient. To this end, we derive theoretically-grounded and intuitive acquisition strategies that are specifically tailored to the goals of active testing, noting these are distinct to those of active learning. As actively selecting labels introduces a bias; we further show how to remove this bias while reducing the variance of the estimator at the same time. Active testing is easy to implement and can be applied to any supervised machine learning method. We demonstrate its effectiveness on models including WideResNets and Gaussian processes on datasets including Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-100.

**Abstract:** In this work, we generalize the reaction-diffusion equation in statistical physics, SchrÃ¶dinger equation in quantum mechanics, Helmholtz equation in paraxial optics into the neural partial differential equations (NPDE), which can be considered as the fundamental equations in the field of artificial intelligence research. We take finite difference method to discretize NPDE for finding numerical solution, and the basic building blocks of deep neural network architecture, including multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks, are generated. The learning strategies, such as Adaptive moment estimation, L-BFGS, pseudoinverse learning algorithms and partial differential equation constrained optimization, are also presented. We believe it is of significance that presented clear physical image of interpretable deep neural networks, which makes it be possible for applying to analog computing device design, and pave the road to physical artificial intelligence.

<p>

**Abstract:** AutoAugment has sparked an interest in automated augmentation methods for deep learning models. These methods estimate image transformation policies for train data that improve generalization to test data. While recent papers evolved in the direction of decreasing policy search complexity, we show that those methods are not robust when applied to biased and noisy data. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate AutoAugment as a generalized automated dataset optimization (AutoDO) task that minimizes the distribution shift between test data and distorted train dataset. In our AutoDO model, we explicitly estimate a set of per-point hyperparameters to flexibly change distribution of train data. In particular, we include hyperparameters for augmentation, loss weights, and soft-labels that are jointly estimated using implicit differentiation. We develop a theoretical probabilistic interpretation of this framework using Fisher information and show that its complexity scales linearly with the dataset size. Our experiments on SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet classification show up to 9.3% improvement for biased datasets with label noise compared to prior methods and, importantly, up to 36.6% gain for underrepresented SVHN classes.

**Abstract:** Skeletal motion plays a vital role in human activity recognition as either an independent data source or a complement. The robustness of skeleton-based activity recognizers has been questioned recently, which shows that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when the full-knowledge of the recognizer is accessible to the attacker. However, this white-box requirement is overly restrictive in most scenarios and the attack is not truly threatening. In this paper, we show that such threats do exist under black-box settings too. To this end, we propose the first black-box adversarial attack method BASAR. Through BASAR, we show that adversarial attack is not only truly a threat but also can be extremely deceitful, because on-manifold adversarial samples are rather common in skeletal motions, in contrast to the common belief that adversarial samples only exist off-manifold. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that BASAR can deliver successful attacks across models, data, and attack modes. Through harsh perceptual studies, we show that it achieves effective yet imperceptible attacks. By analyzing the attack on different activity recognizers, BASAR helps identify the potential causes of their vulnerability and provides insights on what classifiers are likely to be more robust against attack.

**Abstract:** Wav2vec-C introduces a novel representation learning technique combining elements from wav2vec 2.0 and VQ-VAE. Our model learns to reproduce quantized representations from partially masked speech encoding using a contrastive loss in a way similar to Wav2vec 2.0. However, the quantization process is regularized by an additional consistency network that learns to reconstruct the input features to the wav2vec 2.0 network from the quantized representations in a way similar to a VQ-VAE model. The proposed self-supervised model is trained on 10k hours of unlabeled data and subsequently used as the speech encoder in a RNN-T ASR model and fine-tuned with 1k hours of labeled data. This work is one of only a few studies of self-supervised learning on speech tasks with a large volume of real far-field labeled data. The Wav2vec-C encoded representations achieves, on average, twice the error reduction over baseline and a higher codebook utilization in comparison to wav2vec 2.0

**Abstract:** Single computation engines have become a popular design choice for FPGA-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enabling the deployment of diverse models without fabric reconfiguration. This flexibility, however, often comes with significantly reduced performance on memory-bound layers and resource underutilisation due to suboptimal mapping of certain layers on the engine's fixed configuration. In this work, we investigate the implications in terms of CNN engine design for a class of models that introduce a pre-convolution stage to decompress the weights at run time. We refer to these approaches as on-the-fly. To minimise the negative impact of limited bandwidth on memory-bound layers, we present a novel hardware component that enables the on-chip on-the-fly generation of weights. We further introduce an input selective processing element (PE) design that balances the load between PEs on suboptimally mapped layers. Finally, we present unzipFPGA, a framework to train on-the-fly models and traverse the design space to select the highest performing CNN engine configuration. Quantitative evaluation shows that unzipFPGA yields an average speedup of 2.14x and 71% over optimised status-quo and pruned CNN engines under constrained bandwidth and up to 3.69x higher performance density over the state-of-the-art FPGA-based CNN accelerators.

**Abstract:** Robotic manipulation of unknown objects is an important field of research. Practical applications occur in many real-world settings where robots need to interact with an unknown environment. We tackle the problem of reactive grasping by proposing a method for unknown object tracking, grasp point sampling and dynamic trajectory planning. Our object tracking method combines Siamese Networks with an Iterative Closest Point approach for pointcloud registration into a method for 6-DoF unknown object tracking. The method does not require further training and is robust to noise and occlusion. We propose a robotic manipulation system, which is able to grasp a wide variety of formerly unseen objects and is robust against object perturbations and inferior grasping points.

**Abstract:** Medical systems in general, and patient treatment decisions and outcomes in particular, are affected by bias based on gender and other demographic elements. As language models are increasingly applied to medicine, there is a growing interest in building algorithmic fairness into processes impacting patient care. Much of the work addressing this question has focused on biases encoded in language models -- statistical estimates of the relationships between concepts derived from distant reading of corpora. Building on this work, we investigate how word choices made by healthcare practitioners and language models interact with regards to bias. We identify and remove gendered language from two clinical-note datasets and describe a new debiasing procedure using BERT-based gender classifiers. We show minimal degradation in health condition classification tasks for low- to medium-levels of bias removal via data augmentation. Finally, we compare the bias semantically encoded in the language models with the bias empirically observed in health records. This work outlines an interpretable approach for using data augmentation to identify and reduce the potential for bias in natural language processing pipelines.

**Abstract:** Many healthcare decisions involve navigating through a multitude of treatment options in a sequential and iterative manner to find an optimal treatment pathway with the goal of an optimal patient outcome. Such optimization problems may be amenable to reinforcement learning. A reinforcement learning agent could be trained to provide treatment recommendations for physicians, acting as a decision support tool. However, a number of difficulties arise when using RL beyond benchmark environments, such as specifying the reward function, choosing an appropriate state representation and evaluating the learned policy.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose a simple, intuitive yet powerful method for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. HOIs are so diverse in spatial distribution in an image that existing CNN-based methods face the following three major drawbacks; they cannot leverage image-wide features due to CNN's locality, they rely on a manually defined location-of-interest for the feature aggregation, which sometimes does not cover contextually important regions, and they cannot help but mix up the features for multiple HOI instances if they are located closely. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a transformer-based feature extractor, in which an attention mechanism and query-based detection play key roles. The attention mechanism is effective in aggregating contextually important information image-wide, while the queries, which we design in such a way that each query captures at most one human-object pair, can avoid mixing up the features from multiple instances. This transformer-based feature extractor produces so effective embeddings that the subsequent detection heads may be fairly simple and intuitive. The extensive analysis reveals that the proposed method successfully extracts contextually important features, and thus outperforms existing methods by large margins (5.37 mAP on HICO-DET, and 5.7 mAP on V-COCO).

**Abstract:** We present a new domain adaptive self-training pipeline, named ST3D, for unsupervised domain adaptation on 3D object detection from point clouds. First, we pre-train the 3D detector on the source domain with our proposed random object scaling strategy for mitigating the negative effects of source domain bias. Then, the detector is iteratively improved on the target domain by alternatively conducting two steps, which are the pseudo label updating with the developed quality-aware triplet memory bank and the model training with curriculum data augmentation. These specific designs for 3D object detection enable the detector to be trained with consistent and high-quality pseudo labels and to avoid overfitting to the large number of easy examples in pseudo labeled data. Our ST3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated datasets and even surpasses fully supervised results on KITTI 3D object detection benchmark. Code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/ST3D.

**Abstract:** Multimodal IR, spanning text corpus, knowledge graph and images, called outside knowledge visual question answering (OKVQA), is of much recent interest. However, the popular data set has serious limitations. A surprisingly large fraction of queries do not assess the ability to integrate cross-modal information. Instead, some are independent of the image, some depend on speculation, some require OCR or are otherwise answerable from the image alone. To add to the above limitations, frequency-based guessing is very effective because of (unintended) widespread answer overlaps between the train and test folds. Overall, it is hard to determine when state-of-the-art systems exploit these weaknesses rather than really infer the answers, because they are opaque and their 'reasoning' process is uninterpretable. An equally important limitation is that the dataset is designed for the quantitative assessment only of the end-to-end answer retrieval task, with no provision for assessing the correct(semantic) interpretation of the input query. In response, we identify a key structural idiom in OKVQA ,viz., S3 (select, substitute and search), and build a new data set and challenge around it. Specifically, the questioner identifies an entity in the image and asks a question involving that entity which can be answered only by consulting a knowledge graph or corpus passage mentioning the entity. Our challenge consists of (i)OKVQAS3, a subset of OKVQA annotated based on the structural idiom and (ii)S3VQA, a new dataset built from scratch. We also present a neural but structurally transparent OKVQA system, S3, that explicitly addresses our challenge dataset, and outperforms recent competitive baselines.

**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models have been shown to encode large amounts of world and commonsense knowledge in their parameters, leading to substantial interest in methods for extracting that knowledge. In past work, knowledge was extracted by taking manually-authored queries and gathering paraphrases for them using a separate pipeline. In this work, we propose a method for automatically rewriting queries into "BERTese", a paraphrase query that is directly optimized towards better knowledge extraction. To encourage meaningful rewrites, we add auxiliary loss functions that encourage the query to correspond to actual language tokens. We empirically show our approach outperforms competing baselines, obviating the need for complex pipelines. Moreover, BERTese provides some insight into the type of language that helps language models perform knowledge extraction.

**Abstract:** Stochastic generative models enable us to capture the geometric structure of a data manifold lying in a high dimensional space through a Riemannian metric in the latent space. However, its practical use is rather limited mainly due to inevitable complexity. In this work we propose a surrogate conformal Riemannian metric in the latent space of a generative model that is simple, efficient and robust. This metric is based on a learnable prior that we propose to learn using a basic energy-based model. We theoretically analyze the behavior of the proposed metric and show that it is sensible to use in practice. We demonstrate experimentally the efficiency and robustness, as well as the behavior of the new approximate metric. Also, we show the applicability of the proposed methodology for data analysis in the life sciences.

**Abstract:** Recent studies unveil the vulnerabilities of deep ranking models, where an imperceptible perturbation can trigger dramatic changes in the ranking result. While previous attempts focus on manipulating absolute ranks of certain candidates, the possibility of adjusting their relative order remains under-explored. In this paper, we formulate a new adversarial attack against deep ranking systems, i.e., the Order Attack, which covertly alters the relative order among a selected set of candidates according to an attacker-specified permutation, with limited interference to other unrelated candidates. Specifically, it is formulated as a triplet-style loss imposing an inequality chain reflecting the specified permutation. However, direct optimization of such white-box objective is infeasible in a real-world attack scenario due to various black-box limitations. To cope with them, we propose a Short-range Ranking Correlation metric as a surrogate objective for black-box Order Attack to approximate the white-box method. The Order Attack is evaluated on the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets under both white-box and black-box threat models. The black-box attack is also successfully implemented on a major e-commerce platform. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, revealing a new type of ranking model vulnerability.

**Abstract:** The approximation of solutions to second order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations by deep neural networks is investigated. It is shown that for HJB equations that arise in the context of the optimal control of certain Markov processes the solution can be approximated by deep neural networks without incurring the curse of dimension. The dynamics is assumed to depend affinely on the controls and the cost depends quadratically on the controls. The admissible controls take values in a bounded set.

**Abstract:** The design of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to accurately process sequential inputs with long-time dependencies is very challenging on account of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. To overcome this, we propose a novel RNN architecture which is based on a structure preserving discretization of a Hamiltonian system of second-order ordinary differential equations that models networks of oscillators. The resulting RNN is fast, invertible (in time), memory efficient and we derive rigorous bounds on the hidden state gradients to prove the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. A suite of experiments are presented to demonstrate that the proposed RNN provides state of the art performance on a variety of learning tasks with (very) long-time dependencies.

**Abstract:** Operation and maintenance of large distributed cloud applications can quickly become unmanageably complex, putting human operators under immense stress when problems occur. Utilizing machine learning for identification and localization of anomalies in such systems supports human experts and enables fast mitigation. However, due to the various inter-dependencies of system components, anomalies do not only affect their origin but propagate through the distributed system. Taking this into account, we present Arvalus and its variant D-Arvalus, a neural graph transformation method that models system components as nodes and their dependencies and placement as edges to improve the identification and localization of anomalies. Given a series of metric KPIs, our method predicts the most likely system state - either normal or an anomaly class - and performs localization when an anomaly is detected. During our experiments, we simulate a distributed cloud application deployment and synthetically inject anomalies. The evaluation shows the generally good prediction performance of Arvalus and reveals the advantage of D-Arvalus which incorporates information about system component dependencies.

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced existing medical systems for automatic disease diagnosis. However, a threat to these systems arises that adversarial attacks make CNNs vulnerable. Inaccurate diagnosis results make a negative influence on human healthcare. There is a need to investigate potential adversarial attacks to robustify deep medical diagnosis systems. On the other side, there are several modalities of medical images (e.g., CT, fundus, and endoscopic image) of which each type is significantly different from others. It is more challenging to generate adversarial perturbations for different types of medical images. In this paper, we propose an image-based medical adversarial attack method to consistently produce adversarial perturbations on medical images. The objective function of our method consists of a loss deviation term and a loss stabilization term. The loss deviation term increases the divergence between the CNN prediction of an adversarial example and its ground truth label. Meanwhile, the loss stabilization term ensures similar CNN predictions of this example and its smoothed input. From the perspective of the whole iterations for perturbation generation, the proposed loss stabilization term exhaustively searches the perturbation space to smooth the single spot for local optimum escape. We further analyze the KL-divergence of the proposed loss function and find that the loss stabilization term makes the perturbations updated towards a fixed objective spot while deviating from the ground truth. This stabilization ensures the proposed medical attack effective for different types of medical images while producing perturbations in small variance. Experiments on several medical image analysis benchmarks including the recent COVID-19 dataset show the stability of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** Creating robots that can perform general-purpose service tasks in a human-populated environment has been a longstanding grand challenge for AI and Robotics research. One particularly valuable skill that is relevant to a wide variety of tasks is the ability to locate and retrieve objects upon request. This paper models this skill as a Scavenger Hunt (SH) game, which we formulate as a variation of the NP-hard stochastic traveling purchaser problem. In this problem, the goal is to find a set of objects as quickly as possible, given probability distributions of where they may be found. We investigate the performance of several solution algorithms for the SH problem, both in simulation and on a real mobile robot. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an agent to plan a minimal cost path, and show that the RL agent can outperform a range of heuristic algorithms, achieving near optimal performance. In order to stimulate research on this problem, we introduce a publicly available software stack and associated website that enable users to upload scavenger hunts which robots can download, perform, and learn from to continually improve their performance on future hunts.

<p>

**Abstract:** Through the use of examples, we explain one way in which applied topology has evolved since the birth of persistent homology in the early 2000s. The first applications of topology to data emphasized the global shape of a dataset, such as the three-circle model for $3 \times 3$ pixel patches from natural images, or the configuration space of the cyclo-octane molecule, which is a sphere with a Klein bottle attached via two circles of singularity. In these studies of global shape, short persistent homology bars are disregarded as sampling noise. More recently, however, persistent homology has been used to address questions about the local geometry of data. For instance, how can local geometry be vectorized for use in machine learning problems? Persistent homology and its vectorization methods, including persistence landscapes and persistence images, provide popular techniques for incorporating both local geometry and global topology into machine learning. Our meta-hypothesis is that the short bars are as important as the long bars for many machine learning tasks. In defense of this claim, we survey applications of persistent homology to shape recognition, agent-based modeling, materials science, archaeology, and biology. Additionally, we survey work connecting persistent homology to geometric features of spaces, including curvature and fractal dimension, and various methods that have been used to incorporate persistent homology into machine learning.

**Abstract:** Normalizing flows are a class of flexible deep generative models that offer easy likelihood computation. Despite their empirical success, there is little theoretical understanding of their expressiveness. In this work, we study residual flows, a class of normalizing flows composed of Lipschitz residual blocks. We prove residual flows are universal approximators in maximum mean discrepancy. We provide upper bounds on the number of residual blocks to achieve approximation under different assumptions.

**Abstract:** Despite their irresistible success, deep learning algorithms still heavily rely on annotated data. On the other hand, unsupervised settings pose many challenges, especially about determining the right inductive bias in diverse scenarios. One scalable solution is to make the model generate the supervision for itself by leveraging some part of the input data, which is known as self-supervised learning. In this paper, we use the prediction task as self-supervision and build a novel object-centric model for image sequence representation. In addition to disentangling the notion of objects and the motion dynamics, our compositional structure explicitly handles occlusion and inpaints inferred objects and background for the composition of the predicted frame. With the aid of auxiliary loss functions that promote spatially and temporally consistent object representations, our self-supervised framework can be trained without the help of any manual annotation or pretrained network. Initial experiments confirm that the proposed pipeline is a promising step towards object-centric video prediction.

**Abstract:** With the advent of real-world quantum computing, the idea that parametrized quantum computations can be used as hypothesis families in a quantum-classical machine learning system is gaining increasing traction. Such hybrid systems have already shown the potential to tackle real-world tasks in supervised and generative learning, and recent works have established their provable advantages in special artificial tasks. Yet, in the case of reinforcement learning, which is arguably most challenging and where learning boosts would be extremely valuable, no proposal has been successful in solving even standard benchmarking tasks, nor in showing a theoretical learning advantage over classical algorithms. In this work, we achieve both. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning model using very few qubits, which we show can be effectively trained to solve several standard benchmarking environments. Moreover, we demonstrate, and formally prove, the ability of parametrized quantum circuits to solve certain learning tasks that are intractable for classical models, including current state-of-art deep neural networks, under the widely-believed classical hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.

**Abstract:** This paper describes the submissions by team HWR to the Dravidian Language Identification (DLI) shared task organized at VarDial 2021 workshop. The DLI training set includes 16,674 YouTube comments written in Roman script containing code-mixed text with English and one of the three South Dravidian languages: Kannada, Malayalam, and Tamil. We submitted results generated using two models, a Naive Bayes classifier with adaptive language models, which has shown to obtain competitive performance in many language and dialect identification tasks, and a transformer-based model which is widely regarded as the state-of-the-art in a number of NLP tasks. Our first submission was sent in the closed submission track using only the training set provided by the shared task organisers, whereas the second submission is considered to be open as it used a pretrained model trained with external data. Our team attained shared second position in the shared task with the submission based on Naive Bayes. Our results reinforce the idea that deep learning methods are not as competitive in language identification related tasks as they are in many other text classification tasks.

**Abstract:** Clinical diagnostic and treatment decisions rely upon the integration of patient-specific data with clinical reasoning. Cancer presents a unique context that influence treatment decisions, given its diverse forms of disease evolution. Biomedical imaging allows noninvasive assessment of disease based on visual evaluations leading to better clinical outcome prediction and therapeutic planning. Early methods of brain cancer characterization predominantly relied upon statistical modeling of neuroimaging data. Driven by the breakthroughs in computer vision, deep learning became the de facto standard in the domain of medical imaging. Integrated statistical and deep learning methods have recently emerged as a new direction in the automation of the medical practice unifying multi-disciplinary knowledge in medicine, statistics, and artificial intelligence. In this study, we critically review major statistical and deep learning models and their applications in brain imaging research with a focus on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation. The results do highlight that model-driven classical statistics and data-driven deep learning is a potent combination for developing automated systems in clinical oncology.

**Abstract:** Human movement disorders or paralysis lead to the loss of control of muscle activation and thus motor control. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is an established and safe technique for contracting muscles by stimulating the skin above a muscle to induce its contraction. However, an open challenge remains on how to restore motor abilities to human limbs through FES, as the problem of controlling the stimulation is unclear. We are taking a robotics perspective on this problem, by developing robot learning algorithms that control the ultimate humanoid robot, the human body, through electrical muscle stimulation. Human muscles are not trivial to control as actuators due to their force production being non-stationary as a result of fatigue and other internal state changes, in contrast to robot actuators which are well-understood and stationary over broad operation ranges. We present our Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to the control of human muscles with FES, using a recurrent neural network for dynamic state representation, to overcome the unobserved elements of the behaviour of human muscles under external stimulation. We demonstrate our technique both in neuromuscular simulations but also experimentally on a human. Our results show that our controller can learn to manipulate human muscles, applying appropriate levels of stimulation to achieve the given tasks while compensating for advancing muscle fatigue which arises throughout the tasks. Additionally, our technique can learn quickly enough to be implemented in real-world human-in-the-loop settings.

**Abstract:** We present an application of the well-known Mask R-CNN approach to the counting of different types of bacterial colony forming units that were cultured in Petri dishes. Our model was made available to lab technicians in a modern SPA (Single-Page Application). Users can upload images of dishes, after which the Mask R-CNN model that was trained and tuned specifically for this task detects the number of BVG- and BVG+ colonies and displays these in an interactive interface for the user to verify. Users can then check the model's predictions, correct them if deemed necessary, and finally validate them. Our adapted Mask R-CNN model achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 94\% at an intersection-over-union (IoU) threshold of 50\%. With these encouraging results, we see opportunities to bring the benefits of improved accuracy and time saved to related problems, such as generalising to other bacteria types and viral foci counting.

**Abstract:** Matching demand to supply in internet marketplaces (e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery, professional services, advertising) is a global inference problem that can be formulated as a Linear Program (LP) with (millions of) coupling constraints and (up to a billion) non-coupling polytope constraints. Until recently, solving such problems on web-scale data with an LP formulation was intractable. Recent work (Basu et al., 2020) developed a dual decomposition-based approach to solve such problems when the polytope constraints are simple. In this work, we motivate the need to go beyond these simple polytopes and show real-world internet marketplaces that require more complex structured polytope constraints. We expand on the recent literature with novel algorithms that are more broadly applicable to global inference problems. We derive an efficient incremental algorithm using a theoretical insight on the nature of solutions on the polytopes to project onto any arbitrary polytope, that shows massive improvements in performance. Using better optimization routines along with an adaptive algorithm to control the smoothness of the objective, improves the speed of the solution even further. We showcase the efficacy of our approach via experimental results on web-scale marketplace data.

**Abstract:** Text classification is a widely studied problem and has broad applications. In many real-world problems, the number of texts for training classification models is limited, which renders these models prone to overfitting. To address this problem, we propose SSL-Reg, a data-dependent regularization approach based on self-supervised learning (SSL). SSL is an unsupervised learning approach which defines auxiliary tasks on input data without using any human-provided labels and learns data representations by solving these auxiliary tasks. In SSL-Reg, a supervised classification task and an unsupervised SSL task are performed simultaneously. The SSL task is unsupervised, which is defined purely on input texts without using any human-provided labels. Training a model using an SSL task can prevent the model from being overfitted to a limited number of class labels in the classification task. Experiments on 17 text classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

**Abstract:** Modern deep Super-Resolution (SR) networks have established themselves as valuable techniques in image reconstruction and enhancement. However, these networks are normally trained and tested on benchmark image data that lacks the typical image degrading noise present in real images. In this paper, we test the feasibility of using deep SR in real remote sensing payloads by assessing SR performance in reconstructing realistically degraded satellite images. We demonstrate that a state-of-the-art SR technique called Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution Network (EDSR), without domain specific pre-training, can recover encoded pixel data on images with poor ground sampling distance, provided the ground resolved distance is sufficient. However, this recovery varies amongst selected geographical types. Our results indicate that custom training has potential to further improve reconstruction of overhead imagery, and that new satellite hardware should prioritise optical performance over minimising pixel size as deep SR can overcome a lack of the latter but not the former.

**Abstract:** Current Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods mainly depend on medical images. The clinical information, which usually needs to be considered in practical clinical diagnosis, has not been fully employed in CAD. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fusing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/Computed Tomography (CT) images and clinical information for diagnostic tasks. Two paths of neural layers are performed to extract image features and clinical features, respectively, and at the same time clinical features are employed as the attention to guide the extraction of image features. Finally, these two modalities of features are concatenated to make decisions. We evaluate the proposed method on its applications to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, mild cognitive impairment converter prediction and hepatic microvascular invasion diagnosis. The encouraging experimental results prove the values of the image feature extraction guided by clinical features and the concatenation of two modalities of features for classification, which improve the performance of diagnosis effectively and stably.

**Abstract:** The ratio between the probability that two distributions $R$ and $P$ give to points $x$ are known as importance weights or propensity scores and play a fundamental role in many different fields, most notably, statistics and machine learning. Among its applications, importance weights are central to domain adaptation, anomaly detection, and estimations of various divergences such as the KL divergence. We consider the common setting where $R$ and $P$ are only given through samples from each distribution. The vast literature on estimating importance weights is either heuristic, or makes strong assumptions about $R$ and $P$ or on the importance weights themselves.
  In this paper, we explore a computational perspective to the estimation of importance weights, which factors in the limitations and possibilities obtainable with bounded computational resources. We significantly strengthen previous work that use the MaxEntropy approach, that define the importance weights based on a distribution $Q$ closest to $P$, that looks the same as $R$ on every set $C \in \mathcal{C}$, where $\mathcal{C}$ may be a huge collection of sets. We show that the MaxEntropy approach may fail to assign high average scores to sets $C \in \mathcal{C}$, even when the average of ground truth weights for the set is evidently large. We similarly show that it may overestimate the average scores to sets $C \in \mathcal{C}$. We therefore formulate Sandwiching bounds as a notion of set-wise accuracy for importance weights. We study these bounds to show that they capture natural completeness and soundness requirements from the weights. We present an efficient algorithm that under standard learnability assumptions computes weights which satisfy these bounds. Our techniques rely on a new notion of multicalibrated partitions of the domain of the distributions, which appear to be useful objects in their own right.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end deep neural network model for autonomous driving that takes monocular image sequence as input, and directly generates the steering control angle. Firstly, we model the end-to-end driving problem as a local path planning process. Inspired by the environmental representation in the classical planning algorithms(i.e. the beam curvature method), pixel-wise orientations are fed into the network to learn direction-aware features. Next, to handle the imbalanced distribution of steering values in training datasets, we propose an improvement on a cost-sensitive loss function named SteeringLoss2. Besides, we also present a new end-to-end driving dataset, which provides corresponding LiDAR and image sequences, as well as standard driving behaviors. Our dataset includes multiple driving scenarios, such as urban, country, and off-road. Numerous experiments are conducted on both public available LiVi-Set and our own dataset, and the results show that the model using our proposed methods can predict steering angle accurately.

We explore the design space using unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods. 2) How does one identify the class of a bicycle and what factors play a key role in defining it? We address the bicycle classification task by training a multitude of classifiers using different forms of design data and identifying parameters of particular significance through permutation-based interpretability analysis. 3) How does one synthesize new bicycles using different representation methods? We consider numerous machine learning methods to generate new bicycle models as well as interpolate between and extrapolate from existing models using Variational Autoencoders.

**Abstract:** In comparison to classical shallow representation learning techniques, deep neural networks have achieved superior performance in nearly every application benchmark. But despite their clear empirical advantages, it is still not well understood what makes them so effective. To approach this question, we introduce deep frame approximation, a unifying framework for representation learning with structured overcomplete frames. While exact inference requires iterative optimization, it may be approximated by the operations of a feed-forward deep neural network. We then indirectly analyze how model capacity relates to the frame structure induced by architectural hyperparameters such as depth, width, and skip connections. We quantify these structural differences with the deep frame potential, a data-independent measure of coherence linked to representation uniqueness and stability. As a criterion for model selection, we show correlation with generalization error on a variety of common deep network architectures such as ResNets and DenseNets. We also demonstrate how recurrent networks implementing iterative optimization algorithms achieve performance comparable to their feed-forward approximations. This connection to the established theory of overcomplete representations suggests promising new directions for principled deep network architecture design with less reliance on ad-hoc engineering.

**Abstract:** An important issue when using Machine Learning algorithms in recent research is the lack of interpretability. Although these algorithms provide accurate point predictions for various learning problems, uncertainty estimates connected with point predictions are rather sparse. A contribution to this gap for the Random Forest Regression Learner is presented here. Based on its Out-of-Bag procedure, several parametric and non-parametric prediction intervals are provided for Random Forest point predictions and theoretical guarantees for its correct coverage probability is delivered. In a second part, a thorough investigation through Monte-Carlo simulation is conducted evaluating the performance of the proposed methods from three aspects: (i) Analyzing the correct coverage rate of the proposed prediction intervals, (ii) Inspecting interval width and (iii) Verifying the competitiveness of the proposed intervals with existing methods. The simulation yields that the proposed prediction intervals are robust towards non-normal residual distributions and are competitive by providing correct coverage rates and comparably narrow interval lengths, even for comparably small samples.

**Abstract:** Generalized Linear Bandits (GLBs) are powerful extensions to the Linear Bandit (LB) setting, broadening the benefits of reward parametrization beyond linearity. In this paper we study GLBs in non-stationary environments, characterized by a general metric of non-stationarity known as the variation-budget or \emph{parameter-drift}, denoted $B_T$. While previous attempts have been made to extend LB algorithms to this setting, they overlook a salient feature of GLBs which flaws their results. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm that addresses this difficulty. We prove that under a geometric assumption on the action set, our approach enjoys a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(B_T^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound. In the general case, we show that it suffers at most a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(B_T^{1/5}T^{4/5})$ regret. At the core of our contribution is a generalization of the projection step introduced in Filippi et al. (2010), adapted to the non-stationary nature of the problem. Our analysis sheds light on central mechanisms inherited from the setting by explicitly splitting the treatment of the learning and tracking aspects of the problem.

**Abstract:** Predictive human models often need to adapt their parameters online from human data. This raises previously ignored safety-related questions for robots relying on these models such as what the model could learn online and how quickly could it learn it. For instance, when will the robot have a confident estimate in a nearby human's goal? Or, what parameter initializations guarantee that the robot can learn the human's preferences in a finite number of observations? To answer such analysis questions, our key idea is to model the robot's learning algorithm as a dynamical system where the state is the current model parameter estimate and the control is the human data the robot observes. This enables us to leverage tools from reachability analysis and optimal control to compute the set of hypotheses the robot could learn in finite time, as well as the worst and best-case time it takes to learn them. We demonstrate the utility of our analysis tool in four human-robot domains, including autonomous driving and indoor navigation.

Although ray-tracing based methods have shown promising results, obtaining realistic images requires substantial modeling effort and manual parameter tuning. In addition, current techniques still result in a significant appearance gap between simulated images and real clinical scans. Herein we introduce a novel content-preserving image translation framework (ConPres) to bridge this appearance gap, while maintaining the simulated anatomical layout. We achieve this goal by leveraging both simulated images with semantic segmentations and unpaired in-vivo ultrasound scans. Our framework is based on recent contrastive unpaired translation techniques and we propose a regularization approach by learning an auxiliary segmentation-to-real image translation task, which encourages the disentanglement of content and style. In addition, we extend the generator to be class-conditional, which enables the incorporation of additional losses, in particular a cyclic consistency loss, to further improve the translation quality. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art unpaired translation methods demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.

**Abstract:** Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is the task of estimating the expected reward of a given policy based on offline data previously collected under different policies. Therefore, OPE is a key step in applying reinforcement learning to real-world domains such as medical treatment, where interactive data collection is expensive or even unsafe. As the observed data tends to be noisy and limited, it is essential to provide rigorous uncertainty quantification, not just a point estimation, when applying OPE to make high stakes decisions. This work considers the problem of constructing non-asymptotic confidence intervals in infinite-horizon off-policy evaluation, which remains a challenging open question. We develop a practical algorithm through a primal-dual optimization-based approach, which leverages the kernel Bellman loss (KBL) of Feng et al.(2019) and a new martingale concentration inequality of KBL applicable to time-dependent data with unknown mixing conditions. Our algorithm makes minimum assumptions on the data and the function class of the Q-function, and works for the behavior-agnostic settings where the data is collected under a mix of arbitrary unknown behavior policies. We present empirical results that clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing methods.

**Abstract:** Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have resulted in recent breakthroughs in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) across many different domains. An emerging landscape of development environments is making powerful RL techniques more accessible for a growing community of researchers. However, most existing frameworks do not directly address the problem of learning in complex operating environments, such as dense urban settings or defense-related scenarios, that incorporate distributed, heterogeneous teams of agents. To help enable AI research for this important class of applications, we introduce the AI Arena: a scalable framework with flexible abstractions for distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning. The AI Arena extends the OpenAI Gym interface to allow greater flexibility in learning control policies across multiple agents with heterogeneous learning strategies and localized views of the environment. To illustrate the utility of our framework, we present experimental results that demonstrate performance gains due to a distributed multi-agent learning approach over commonly-used RL techniques in several different learning environments.

**Abstract:** Facial expressions play a fundamental role in human communication. Indeed, they typically reveal the real emotional status of people beyond the spoken language. Moreover, the comprehension of human affect based on visual patterns is a key ingredient for any human-machine interaction system and, for such reasons, the task of Facial Expression Recognition (FER) draws both scientific and industrial interest. In the recent years, Deep Learning techniques reached very high performance on FER by exploiting different architectures and learning paradigms. In such a context, we propose a multi-resolution approach to solve the FER task. We ground our intuition on the observation that often faces images are acquired at different resolutions. Thus, directly considering such property while training a model can help achieve higher performance on recognizing facial expressions. To our aim, we use a ResNet-like architecture, equipped with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, trained on the Affect-in-the-Wild 2 dataset. Not being available a test set, we conduct tests and models selection by employing the validation set only on which we achieve more than 90\% accuracy on classifying the seven expressions that the dataset comprises.

**Abstract:** We use differentiable programming and gradient descent to find unitary matrices that can be used in the period finding algorithm to extract period information from the state of a quantum computer post application of the oracle. The standard procedure is to use the inverse quantum Fourier transform. Our findings suggest that that this is not the only unitary matrix appropriate for the period finding algorithm, There exist several unitary matrices that can affect out the same transformation and they are significantly different from each other as well. These unitary matrices can be learned by an algorithm. Neural networks can be applied to differentiate such unitary matrices from randomly generated ones indicating that these unitaries do have characteristic features that cannot otherwise be discerned easily.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of chance constrained optimization where it is sought to optimize a function and satisfy constraints, both of which are affected by uncertainties. The real world declinations of this problem are particularly challenging because of their inherent computational cost.
  To tackle such problems, we propose a new Bayesian optimization method. It applies to the situation where the uncertainty comes from some of the inputs, so that it becomes possible to define an acquisition criterion in the joint controlled-uncontrolled input space. The main contribution of this work is an acquisition criterion that accounts for both the average improvement in objective function and the constraint reliability. The criterion is derived following the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction logic and its maximization provides both optimal controlled and uncontrolled parameters. Analytical expressions are given to efficiently calculate the criterion. Numerical studies on test functions are presented. It is found through experimental comparisons with alternative sampling criteria that the adequation between the sampling criterion and the problem contributes to the efficiency of the overall optimization. As a side result, an expression for the variance of the improvement is given.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a novel iterative algorithm which carries out $Î±$-divergence minimisation by ensuring a systematic decrease in the $Î±$-divergence at each step. In its most general form, our framework allows us to simultaneously optimise the weights and components parameters of a given mixture model. Notably, our approach permits to build on various methods previously proposed for $Î±$-divergence minimisation such as gradient or power descent schemes. Furthermore, we shed a new light on an integrated Expectation Maximization algorithm. We provide empirical evidence that our methodology yields improved results, all the while illustrating the numerical benefits of having introduced some flexibility through the parameter $Î±$ of the $Î±$-divergence.

**Abstract:** Since their inception, transformer-based language models have led to impressive performance gains across multiple natural language processing tasks. For Arabic, the current state-of-the-art results on most datasets are achieved by the AraBERT language model. Notwithstanding these recent advancements, sarcasm and sentiment detection persist to be challenging tasks in Arabic, given the language's rich morphology, linguistic disparity and dialectal variations. This paper proffers team SPPU-AASM's submission for the WANLP ArSarcasm shared-task 2021, which centers around the sarcasm and sentiment polarity detection of Arabic tweets. The study proposes a hybrid model, combining sentence representations from AraBERT with static word vectors trained on Arabic social media corpora. The proposed system achieves a F1-sarcastic score of 0.62 and a F-PN score of 0.715 for the sarcasm and sentiment detection tasks, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed system outperforms multiple existing approaches for both the tasks, suggesting that the amalgamation of context-free and context-dependent text representations can help capture complementary facets of word meaning in Arabic. The system ranked second and tenth in the respective sub-tasks of sarcasm detection and sentiment identification.

**Abstract:** State estimation is critical to control systems, especially when the states cannot be directly measured. This paper presents an approximate optimal filter, which enables to use policy iteration technique to obtain the steady-state gain in linear Gaussian time-invariant systems. This design transforms the optimal filtering problem with minimum mean square error into an optimal control problem, called Approximate Optimal Filtering (AOF) problem. The equivalence holds given certain conditions about initial state distributions and policy formats, in which the system state is the estimation error, control input is the filter gain, and control objective function is the accumulated estimation error. We present a policy iteration algorithm to solve the AOF problem in steady-state. A classic vehicle state estimation problem finally evaluates the approximate filter. The results show that the policy converges to the steady-state Kalman gain, and its accuracy is within 2 %.

**Abstract:** Learning cross-view consistent feature representation is the key for accurate vehicle Re-identification (ReID), since the visual appearance of vehicles changes significantly under different viewpoints. To this end, most existing approaches resort to the supervised cross-view learning using extensive extra viewpoints annotations, which however, is difficult to deploy in real applications due to the expensive labelling cost and the continous viewpoint variation that makes it hard to define discrete viewpoint labels. In this study, we present a pluggable Weakly-supervised Cross-View Learning (WCVL) module for vehicle ReID. Through hallucinating the cross-view samples as the hardest positive counterparts in feature domain, we can learn the consistent feature representation via minimizing the cross-view feature distance based on vehicle IDs only without using any viewpoint annotation. More importantly, the proposed method can be seamlessly plugged into most existing vehicle ReID baselines for cross-view learning without re-training the baselines. To demonstrate its efficacy, we plug the proposed method into a bunch of off-the-shelf baselines and obtain significant performance improvement on four public benchmark datasets, i.e., VeRi-776, VehicleID, VRIC and VRAI.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a model-based framework to automatically and efficiently design understandable and verifiable behaviors for swarms of robots. The framework is based on the automatic extraction of two distinct models: 1) a neural network model trained to estimate the relationship between the robots' sensor readings and the global performance of the swarm, and 2) a probabilistic state transition model that explicitly models the local state transitions (i.e., transitions in observations from the perspective of a single robot in the swarm) given a policy. The models can be trained from a data set of simulated runs featuring random policies. The first model is used to automatically extract a set of local states that are expected to maximize the global performance. These local states are referred to as desired local states. The second model is used to optimize a stochastic policy so as to increase the probability that the robots in the swarm observe one of the desired local states. Following these steps, the framework proposed in this paper can efficiently lead to effective controllers. This is tested on four case studies, featuring aggregation and foraging tasks. Importantly, thanks to the models, the framework allows us to understand and inspect a swarm's behavior. To this end, we propose verification checks to identify some potential issues that may prevent the swarm from achieving the desired global objective. In addition, we explore how the framework can be used in combination with a "standard" evolutionary robotics strategy (i.e., where performance is measured via simulation), or with online learning.

**Abstract:** In this paper, the circle formation control problem is addressed for a group of cooperative underactuated fish-like robots involving unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances. Based on the reinforcement learning and cognitive consistency theory, we propose a decentralized controller without the knowledge of the dynamics of the fish-like robots. The proposed controller can be transferred from simulation to reality. It is only trained in our established simulation environment, and the trained controller can be deployed to real robots without any manual tuning. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model-free robust formation control method is scalable with respect to the group size of the robots and outperforms other representative RL algorithms. Several experiments in the real world verify the effectiveness of our RL-based approach for circle formation control.

**Abstract:** In online applications with streaming data, awareness of how far the training or test set has shifted away from the original dataset can be crucial to the performance of the model. However, we may not have access to historical samples in the data stream. To cope with such situations, we propose a novel method, Continual Density Ratio Estimation (CDRE), for estimating density ratios between the initial and current distributions ($p/q_t$) of a data stream in an iterative fashion without the need of storing past samples, where $q_t$ is shifting away from $p$ over time $t$. We demonstrate that CDRE can be more accurate than standard DRE in terms of estimating divergences between distributions, despite not requiring samples from the original distribution. CDRE can be applied in scenarios of online learning, such as importance weighted covariate shift, tracing dataset changes for better decision making. In addition, (CDRE) enables the evaluation of generative models under the setting of continual learning. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing method that can evaluate generative models in continual learning without storing samples from the original distribution.

**Abstract:** High image resolution is critical to obtain a good performance in many computer vision applications. Computational complexity of CNNs, however, grows significantly with the increase in input image size. Here, we show that it is almost always possible to modify a network such that it achieves higher accuracy at a higher input resolution while having the same number of parameters or/and FLOPS. The idea is similar to the EfficientNet paper but instead of optimizing network width, depth and resolution simultaneously, here we focus only on input resolution. This makes the search space much smaller which is more suitable for low computational budget regimes. More importantly, by controlling for the number of model parameters (and hence model capacity), we show that the additional benefit in accuracy is indeed due to the higher input resolution. Preliminary empirical investigation over MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the generalization performance of min $\ell_2$-norm overfitting solutions for the neural tangent kernel (NTK) model of a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation that has no bias term. We show that, depending on the ground-truth function, the test error of overfitted NTK models exhibits characteristics that are different from the "double-descent" of other overparameterized linear models with simple Fourier or Gaussian features. Specifically, for a class of learnable functions, we provide a new upper bound of the generalization error that approaches a small limiting value, even when the number of neurons $p$ approaches infinity. This limiting value further decreases with the number of training samples $n$. For functions outside of this class, we provide a lower bound on the generalization error that does not diminish to zero even when $n$ and $p$ are both large.

**Abstract:** NystrÃ¶m approximation is a fast randomized method that rapidly solves kernel ridge regression (KRR) problems through sub-sampling the n-by-n empirical kernel matrix appearing in the objective function. However, the performance of such a sub-sampling method heavily relies on correctly estimating the statistical leverage scores for forming the sampling distribution, which can be as costly as solving the original KRR. In this work, we propose a linear time (modulo poly-log terms) algorithm to accurately approximate the statistical leverage scores in the stationary-kernel-based KRR with theoretical guarantees. Particularly, by analyzing the first-order condition of the KRR objective, we derive an analytic formula, which depends on both the input distribution and the spectral density of stationary kernels, for capturing the non-uniformity of the statistical leverage scores. Numerical experiments demonstrate that with the same prediction accuracy our method is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing methods in selecting the representative sub-samples in the NystrÃ¶m approximation.

However, it is difficult to use graphs tocapture non-binary relations such as communitiesof vertices. These kinds of complex relations areexpressed more naturally as hypergraphs.

We apply here meta-learning to a simple Deep Learning BCI architecture and compare it to transfer learning on the same architecture. Our Meta-learning strategy operates by finding optimal parameters for the BCI decoder so that it can quickly generalise between different users and recording sessions -- thereby also generalising to new users or new sessions quickly. We tested our algorithm on the Physionet EEG motor imagery dataset. Our approach increased motor imagery classification accuracy between 60% to 80%, outperforming other algorithms under the little-data condition. We believe that establishing the meta-learning or learning-to-learn approach will help neural engineering and human interfacing with the challenges of quickly setting up decoders of neural signals to make them more suitable for daily-life.

Our pipeline utilizes 3D ConvNet for a variable number of input hypotheses to select the optimal slice from the input stack. We use random shuffle and Gumbel-softmax to improve network performance. We also propose to generate synthetic defocused images with various asymmetric coded apertures to facilitate training. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

As this task is challenging and time-consuming, we present the Sketch2aia approach that automates this process. Sketch2aia employs deep learning to detect the most frequent user interface components and their position on a hand-drawn sketch creating an intermediate representation of the user interface and then automatically generates the App Inventor code of the wireframe. The approach achieves an average user interface component classification accuracy of 87,72% and results of a preliminary user evaluation indicate that it generates wireframes that closely mirror the sketches in terms of visual similarity. The approach has been implemented as a web tool and can be used to support the end-user development of mobile applications effectively and efficiently as well as the teaching of user interface design in K-12.

**Abstract:** Deep learning techniques are one of the most significant elements of any Artificial Intelligence (AI) services. Recently, these Machine Learning (ML) methods, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presented exceptional achievement in implementing human-level capabilities for various predicaments, such as Natural Processing Language (NLP), voice recognition, and image processing, etc. Training these models are expensive in terms of computational power and the existence of enough labelled data. Thus, ML-based models such as DNNs establish genuine business value and intellectual property (IP) for their owners. Therefore the trained models need to be protected from any adversary attacks such as illegal redistribution, reproducing, and derivation. Watermarking can be considered as an effective technique for securing a DNN model. However, so far, most of the watermarking algorithm focuses on watermarking the DNN by adding noise to an image. To this end, we propose a framework for watermarking a DNN model designed for a textual domain. The watermark generation scheme provides a secure watermarking method by combining Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a particular word. The proposed embedding procedure takes place in the model's training time, making the watermark verification stage straightforward by sending the watermarked document to the trained model. The experimental results show that watermarked models have the same accuracy as the original ones. The proposed framework accurately verifies the ownership of all surrogate models without impairing the performance. The proposed algorithm is robust against well-known attacks such as parameter pruning and brute force attack.

Chest CT is essential in prognostication, diagnosing this disease, and assessing the complication. In this paper, a multi-class COVID-19 CT segmentation is proposed aiming at helping radiologists estimate the extent of effected lung volume. We utilized four augmented pyramid networks on an encoder-decoder segmentation framework. Quadruple Augmented Pyramid Network (QAP-Net) not only enable CNN capture features from variation size of CT images, but also act as spatial interconnections and down-sampling to transfer sufficient feature information for semantic segmentation. Experimental results achieve competitive performance in segmentation with the Dice of 0.8163, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the proposed framework can segments of consolidation as well as glass, ground area via COVID-19 chest CT efficiently and accurately.

**Abstract:** A sequential decision process in which an adaptive radar system repeatedly interacts with a finite-state target channel is studied. The radar is capable of passively sensing the spectrum at regular intervals, which provides side information for the waveform selection process. The radar transmitter uses the sequence of spectrum observations as well as feedback from a collocated receiver to select waveforms which accurately estimate target parameters. It is shown that the waveform selection problem can be effectively addressed using a linear contextual bandit formulation in a manner that is both computationally feasible and sample efficient. Stochastic and adversarial linear contextual bandit models are introduced, allowing the radar to achieve effective performance in broad classes of physical environments. Simulations in a radar-communication coexistence scenario, as well as in an adversarial radar-jammer scenario, demonstrate that the proposed formulation provides a substantial improvement in target detection performance when Thompson Sampling and EXP3 algorithms are used to drive the waveform selection process. Further, it is shown that the harmful impacts of pulse-agile behavior on coherently processed radar data can be mitigated by adopting a time-varying constraint on the radar's waveform catalog.

**Abstract:** Conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) used in industry settings can be trained to closely mimic human behaviors, including lying and deception. However, lying is often a necessary part of negotiation. To address this, we develop a normative framework for when it is ethical or unethical for a conversational AI to lie to humans, based on whether there is what we call "invitation of trust" in a particular scenario. Importantly, cultural norms play an important role in determining whether there is invitation of trust across negotiation settings, and thus an AI trained in one culture may not be generalizable to others. Moreover, individuals may have different expectations regarding the invitation of trust and propensity to lie for human vs. AI negotiators, and these expectations may vary across cultures as well. Finally, we outline how a conversational chatbot can be trained to negotiate ethically by applying autoregressive models to large dialog and negotiations datasets.

**Abstract:** Malicious applications (especially in the Android platform) are a serious threat to developers and end-users. Many research efforts have hence been devoted to developing effective approaches to defend Android malware. However, with the explosive growth of Android malware and the continuous advancement of malicious evasion technologies like obfuscation and reflection, android malware defenses based on manual rules or traditional machine learning may not be effective due to limited apriori knowledge. In recent years, a dominant research field of deep learning (DL) with the powerful feature abstraction ability has demonstrated a compelling and promising performance in various fields, like Nature Language processing and image processing. To this end, employing deep learning techniques to thwart the attack of Android malware has recently gained considerable research attention. Yet, there exists no systematic literature review that focuses on deep learning approaches for Android Malware defenses. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to search and analyze how deep learning approaches have been applied in the context of malware defenses in the Android environment. As a result, a total of 104 studies were identified over the period 2014-2020. The results of our investigation show that even though most of these studies still mainly consider DL-based on Android malware detection, 35 primary studies (33.7\%) design the defenses approaches based on other scenarios. This review also describes research trends, research focuses, challenges, and future research directions in DL-based Android malware defenses.

**Abstract:** Cytoarchitecture describes the spatial organization of neuronal cells in the brain, including their arrangement into layers and columns with respect to cell density, orientation, or presence of certain cell types. It allows to segregate the brain into cortical areas and subcortical nuclei, links structure with connectivity and function, and provides a microstructural reference for human brain atlases. Mapping boundaries between areas requires to scan histological sections at microscopic resolution. While recent high-throughput scanners allow to scan a complete human brain in the order of a year, it is practically impossible to delineate regions at the same pace using the established gold standard method. Researchers have recently addressed cytoarchitectonic mapping of cortical regions with deep neural networks, relying on image patches from individual 2D sections for classification. However, the 3D context, which is needed to disambiguate complex or obliquely cut brain regions, is not taken into account. In this work, we combine 2D histology with 3D topology by reformulating the mapping task as a node classification problem on an approximate 3D midsurface mesh through the isocortex. We extract deep features from cortical patches in 2D histological sections which are descriptive of cytoarchitecture, and assign them to the corresponding nodes on the 3D mesh to construct a large attributed graph. By solving the brain mapping problem on this graph using graph neural networks, we obtain significantly improved classification results. The proposed framework lends itself nicely to integration of additional neuroanatomical priors for mapping.

**Abstract:** One of the central puzzles in modern machine learning is the ability of heavily overparametrized models to generalize well. Although the low-dimensional structure of typical datasets is key to this behavior, most theoretical studies of overparametrization focus on isotropic inputs. In this work, we instead consider an analytically tractable model of structured data, where the input covariance is built from independent blocks allowing us to tune the saliency of low-dimensional structures and their alignment with respect to the target function. Using methods from statistical physics, we derive a precise asymptotic expression for the train and test error achieved by random feature models trained to classify such data, which is valid for any convex loss function. We study in detail how the data structure affects the double descent curve, and show that in the over-parametrized regime, its impact is greater for logistic loss than for mean-squared loss: the easier the task, the wider the gap in performance at the advantage of the logistic loss. Our insights are confirmed by numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10.

**Abstract:** Integrated task and motion planning (TAMP) is desirable for generalized autonomy robots but it is challenging at the same time. TAMP requires the planner to not only search in both the large symbolic task space and the high-dimension motion space but also deal with the infeasible task actions due to its intrinsic hierarchical process. We propose a novel decision-making framework for TAMP by constructing an extended decision tree for both symbolic task planning and high-dimension motion variable binding. We integrate top-k planning for generating explicitly a skeleton space where a variety of candidate skeleton plans are at disposal. Moreover, we effectively combine this skeleton space with the resultant motion variable spaces into a single extended decision space. Accordingly, we use Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to ensure an exploration-exploitation balance at each decision node and optimize globally to produce optimal solutions. The proposed seamless combination of symbolic top-k planning with streams, with the proved optimality of MCTS, leads to a powerful planning algorithm that can handle the combinatorial complexity of long-horizon manipulation tasks. We empirically evaluate our proposed algorithm in challenging robot tasks with different domains that require multi-stage decisions and show how our method can overcome the large task space and motion space through its effective tree search compared to its most competitive baseline method.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a novel approach for mining different program features by analysing the internal behaviour of a deep neural network trained on source code. Using an unlabelled dataset of Java programs and three different embedding strategies for the methods in the dataset, we train an autoencoder for each program embedding and then we test the emerging ability of the internal neurons in autonomously building internal representations for different program features. We defined three binary classification labelling policies inspired by real programming issues, so to test the performance of each neuron in classifying programs accordingly to these classification rules, showing that some neurons can actually detect different program properties. We also analyse how the program representation chosen as input affects the performance on the aforementioned tasks. On the other hand, we are interested in finding the overall most informative neurons in the network regardless of a given task. To this aim, we propose and evaluate two methods for ranking neurons independently of any property. Finally, we discuss how these ideas can be applied in different settings for simplifying the programmers' work, for instance if included in environments such as software repositories or code editors.

**Abstract:** Many efforts have been made to discover tumor-specific microenvironment elements (TMEs) from immunostained tissue sections. However, the identification of yet unknown but relevant TMEs from multiplex immunostained tissues remains a challenge, due to the number of markers involved (tens) and the complexity of their spatial interactions. We present NaroNet, which uses machine learning to identify and annotate known as well as novel TMEs from self-supervised embeddings of cells, organized at different levels (local cell phenotypes and cellular neighborhoods). Then it uses the abundance of TMEs to classify patients based on biological or clinical features. We validate NaroNet using synthetic patient cohorts with adjustable incidence of different TMEs and two cancer patient datasets. In both synthetic and real datasets, NaroNet unsupervisedly identifies novel TMEs, relevant for the user-defined classification task. As NaroNet requires only patient-level information, it renders state-of-the-art computational methods accessible to a broad audience, accelerating the discovery of biomarker signatures.

**Abstract:** Security-sensitive applications that rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to small perturbations that are crafted to generate Adversarial Examples(AEs). The AEs are imperceptible to humans and cause DNN to misclassify them. Many defense and detection techniques have been proposed. Model's confidences and Dropout, as a popular way to estimate the model's uncertainty, have been used for AE detection but they showed limited success against black- and gray-box attacks. Moreover, the state-of-the-art detection techniques have been designed for specific attacks or broken by others, need knowledge about the attacks, are not consistent, increase model parameters overhead, are time-consuming, or have latency in inference time. To trade off these factors, we revisit the model's uncertainty and confidences and propose a novel unsupervised ensemble AE detection mechanism that 1) uses the uncertainty method called SelectiveNet, 2) processes model layers outputs, i.e.feature maps, to generate new confidence probabilities. The detection method is called Selective and Feature based Adversarial Detection (SFAD). Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves better performance against black- and gray-box attacks than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable performance against white-box attacks. Moreover, results show that SFAD is fully robust against High Confidence Attacks (HCAs) for MNIST and partially robust for CIFAR10 datasets.

**Abstract:** Artifacts are a common occurrence in Diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans. Identifying and removing them is essential to ensure the accuracy and viability of any post processing carried out on these scans. This makes QC (quality control) a crucial first step prior to any analysis of dMRI data. Several QC methods for artifact detection exist, however they suffer from problems like requiring manual intervention and the inability to generalize across different artifacts and datasets. In this paper, we propose an automated deep learning (DL) pipeline that utilizes a 3D-Densenet architecture to train a model on diffusion volumes for automatic artifact detection. Our method is applied on a vast dataset consisting of 9000 volumes sourced from 7 large clinical datasets. These datasets comprise scans from multiple scanners with different gradient directions, high and low b values, single shell and multi shell acquisitions. Additionally, they represent diverse subject demographics like the presence or absence of pathologies. Our QC method is found to accurately generalize across this heterogenous data by correctly detecting 92% artifacts on average across our test set. This consistent performance over diverse datasets underlines the generalizability of our method, which currently is a significant barrier hindering the widespread adoption of automated QC techniques. For these reasons, we believe that 3D-QCNet can be integrated in diffusion pipelines to effectively automate the arduous and time-intensive process of artifact detection.

**Abstract:** Computed tomography (CT) reconstruction from X-ray projections acquired within a limited angle range is challenging, especially when the angle range is extremely small. Both analytical and iterative models need more projections for effective modeling. Deep learning methods have gained prevalence due to their excellent reconstruction performances, but such success is mainly limited within the same dataset and does not generalize across datasets with different distributions. Hereby we propose ExtraPolationNetwork for limited-angle CT reconstruction via the introduction of a sinogram extrapolation module, which is theoretically justified. The module complements extra sinogram information and boots model generalizability. Extensive experimental results show that our reconstruction model achieves state-of-the-art performance on NIH-AAPM dataset, similar to existing approaches. More importantly, we show that using such a sinogram extrapolation module significantly improves the generalization capability of the model on unseen datasets (e.g., COVID-19 and LIDC datasets) when compared to existing approaches.
