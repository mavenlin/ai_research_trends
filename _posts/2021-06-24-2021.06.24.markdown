**Abstract:** The vision community is witnessing a modeling shift from CNNs to Transformers, where pure Transformer architectures have attained top accuracy on the major video recognition benchmarks. These video models are all built on Transformer layers that globally connect patches across the spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we instead advocate an inductive bias of locality in video Transformers, which leads to a better speed-accuracy trade-off compared to previous approaches which compute self-attention globally even with spatial-temporal factorization. The locality of the proposed video architecture is realized by adapting the Swin Transformer designed for the image domain, while continuing to leverage the power of pre-trained image models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a broad range of video recognition benchmarks, including on action recognition (84.9 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and 86.1 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-600 with ~20x less pre-training data and ~3x smaller model size) and temporal modeling (69.6 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2). The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Video-Swin-Transformer.

**Abstract:** Federated learning has emerged as an important paradigm for training machine learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph classification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples, which can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different sets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID regarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a graph clustered federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity among graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of GNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering, and design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time warping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.

**Abstract:** An agent that is capable of predicting what happens next can perform a variety of tasks through planning with no additional training. Furthermore, such an agent can internally represent the complex dynamics of the real-world and therefore can acquire a representation useful for a variety of visual perception tasks. This makes predicting the future frames of a video, conditioned on the observed past and potentially future actions, an interesting task which remains exceptionally challenging despite many recent advances. Existing video prediction models have shown promising results on simple narrow benchmarks but they generate low quality predictions on real-life datasets with more complicated dynamics or broader domain. There is a growing body of evidence that underfitting on the training data is one of the primary causes for the low quality predictions. In this paper, we argue that the inefficient use of parameters in the current video models is the main reason for underfitting. Therefore, we introduce a new architecture, named FitVid, which is capable of severe overfitting on the common benchmarks while having similar parameter count as the current state-of-the-art models. We analyze the consequences of overfitting, illustrating how it can produce unexpected outcomes such as generating high quality output by repeating the training data, and how it can be mitigated using existing image augmentation techniques. As a result, FitVid outperforms the current state-of-the-art models across four different video prediction benchmarks on four different metrics.

**Abstract:** In the past, the rapidly evolving field of sound classification greatly benefited from the application of methods from other domains. Today, we observe the trend to fuse domain-specific tasks and approaches together, which provides the community with new outstanding models.
  In this work, we present an extension of the CLIP model that handles audio in addition to text and images. Our proposed model incorporates the ESResNeXt audio-model into the CLIP framework using the AudioSet dataset. Such a combination enables the proposed model to perform bimodal and unimodal classification and querying, while keeping CLIP's ability to generalize to unseen datasets in a zero-shot inference fashion.
  AudioCLIP achieves new state-of-the-art results in the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) task, out-performing other approaches by reaching accuracies of 90.07% on the UrbanSound8K and 97.15% on the ESC-50 datasets. Further it sets new baselines in the zero-shot ESC-task on the same datasets 68.78% and 69.40%, respectively).
  Finally, we also assess the cross-modal querying performance of the proposed model as well as the influence of full and partial training on the results. For the sake of reproducibility, our code is published.

**Abstract:** Breakthroughs in machine learning in the last decade have led to `digital intelligence', i.e. machine learning models capable of learning from vast amounts of labeled data to perform several digital tasks such as speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation and so on. The goal of this thesis is to make progress towards designing algorithms capable of `physical intelligence', i.e. building intelligent autonomous navigation agents capable of learning to perform complex navigation tasks in the physical world involving visual perception, natural language understanding, reasoning, planning, and sequential decision making. Despite several advances in classical navigation methods in the last few decades, current navigation agents struggle at long-term semantic navigation tasks. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss our work on short-term navigation using end-to-end reinforcement learning to tackle challenges such as obstacle avoidance, semantic perception, language grounding, and reasoning. In the second part, we present a new class of navigation methods based on modular learning and structured explicit map representations, which leverage the strengths of both classical and end-to-end learning methods, to tackle long-term navigation tasks. We show that these methods are able to effectively tackle challenges such as localization, mapping, long-term planning, exploration and learning semantic priors. These modular learning methods are capable of long-term spatial and semantic understanding and achieve state-of-the-art results on various navigation tasks.

**Abstract:** The astounding success made by artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and other fields proves that AI can achieve human-like performance. However, success always comes with challenges. Deep learning algorithms are data-dependent and require large datasets for training. The lack of data in the medical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning to medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis are costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also require many resources, such as human expertise and funding. That makes it difficult for non-medical researchers to have access to useful and large medical data. Thus, as comprehensive as possible, this paper provides a collection of medical image datasets with their associated challenges for deep learning research. We have collected information of around three hundred datasets and challenges mainly reported between 2013 and 2020 and categorized them into four categories: head & neck, chest & abdomen, pathology & blood, and ``others''. Our paper has three purposes: 1) to provide a most up to date and complete list that can be used as a universal reference to easily find the datasets for clinical image analysis, 2) to guide researchers on the methodology to test and evaluate their methods' performance and robustness on relevant datasets, 3) to provide a ``route'' to relevant algorithms for the relevant medical topics, and challenge leaderboards.

**Abstract:** Prompting language models (LMs) with training examples and task descriptions has been seen as critical to recent successes in few-shot learning. In this work, we show that finetuning LMs in the few-shot setting can considerably reduce the need for prompt engineering. In fact, one can use null prompts, prompts that contain neither task-specific templates nor training examples, and achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of tasks. While finetuning LMs does introduce new parameters for each downstream task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced: finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than standard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters. All in all, we recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust to different prompts, and can be made nearly as efficient as using frozen LMs.

**Abstract:** Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs), we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower, bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in shallow DoF rendering.

**Abstract:** Modeling the joint distribution of high-dimensional data is a central task in unsupervised machine learning. In recent years, many interests have been attracted to developing learning models based on tensor networks, which have advantages of theoretical understandings of the expressive power using entanglement properties, and as a bridge connecting the classical computation and the quantum computation. Despite the great potential, however, existing tensor-network-based unsupervised models only work as a proof of principle, as their performances are much worse than the standard models such as the restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this work, we present the Autoregressive Matrix Product States (AMPS), a tensor-network-based model combining the matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and the autoregressive models from machine learning. The model enjoys exact calculation of normalized probability and unbiased sampling, as well as a clear theoretical understanding of expressive power. We demonstrate the performance of our model using two applications, the generative modeling on synthetic and real-world data, and the reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive numerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing tensor-network-based models and the restricted Boltzmann machines, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural network models.

**Abstract:** Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications, such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.

**Abstract:** We present Brax, an open source library for rigid body simulation with a focus on performance and parallelism on accelerators, written in JAX. We present results on a suite of tasks inspired by the existing reinforcement learning literature, but remade in our engine. Additionally, we provide reimplementations of PPO, SAC, ES, and direct policy optimization in JAX that compile alongside our environments, allowing the learning algorithm and the environment processing to occur on the same device, and to scale seamlessly on accelerators. Finally, we include notebooks that facilitate training of performant policies on common OpenAI Gym MuJoCo-like tasks in minutes.

**Abstract:** The ability to plan into the future while utilizing only raw high-dimensional observations, such as images, can provide autonomous agents with broad capabilities. Visual model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that plan future actions directly have shown impressive results on tasks that require only short-horizon reasoning, however, these methods struggle on temporally extended tasks. We argue that it is easier to solve long-horizon tasks by planning sequences of states rather than just actions, as the effects of actions greatly compound over time and are harder to optimize. To achieve this, we draw on the idea of collocation, which has shown good results on long-horizon tasks in optimal control literature, and adapt it to the image-based setting by utilizing learned latent state space models. The resulting latent collocation method (LatCo) optimizes trajectories of latent states, which improves over previously proposed shooting methods for visual model-based RL on tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals.

**Abstract:** Recently, vision transformers and MLP-based models have been developed in order to address some of the prevalent weaknesses in convolutional neural networks. Due to the novelty of transformers being used in this domain along with the self-attention mechanism, it remains unclear to what degree these architectures are robust to corruptions. Despite some works proposing that data augmentation remains essential for a model to be robust against corruptions, we propose to explore the impact that the architecture has on corruption robustness. We find that vision transformer architectures are inherently more robust to corruptions than the ResNet-50 and MLP-Mixers. We also find that vision transformers with 5 times fewer parameters than a ResNet-50 have more shape bias. Our code is available to reproduce.

**Abstract:** Learning new tasks continuously without forgetting on a constantly changing data distribution is essential for real-world problems but extremely challenging for modern deep learning. In this work we propose HCL, a Hybrid generative-discriminative approach to Continual Learning for classification. We model the distribution of each task and each class with a normalizing flow. The flow is used to learn the data distribution, perform classification, identify task changes, and avoid forgetting, all leveraging the invertibility and exact likelihood which are uniquely enabled by the normalizing flow model. We use the generative capabilities of the flow to avoid catastrophic forgetting through generative replay and a novel functional regularization technique. For task identification, we use state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques based on measuring the typicality of the model's statistics. We demonstrate the strong performance of HCL on a range of continual learning benchmarks such as split-MNIST, split-CIFAR, and SVHN-MNIST.

**Abstract:** Detection of semantic data types is a very crucial task in data science for automated data cleaning, schema matching, data discovery, semantic data type normalization and sensitive data identification. Existing methods include regular expression-based or dictionary lookup-based methods that are not robust to dirty as well unseen data and are limited to a very less number of semantic data types to predict. Existing Machine Learning methods extract large number of engineered features from data and build logistic regression, random forest or feedforward neural network for this purpose. In this paper, we introduce DCoM, a collection of multi-input NLP-based deep neural networks to detect semantic data types where instead of extracting large number of features from the data, we feed the raw values of columns (or instances) to the model as texts. We train DCoM on 686,765 data columns extracted from VizNet corpus with 78 different semantic data types. DCoM outperforms other contemporary results with a quite significant margin on the same dataset.

**Abstract:** Although the tailored metal active sites and porous architectures of MOFs hold great promise for engineering challenges ranging from gas separations to catalysis, a lack of understanding of how to improve their stability limits their use in practice. To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of published reports of the key aspects of MOF stability necessary for their practical application: the ability to withstand high temperatures without degrading and the capacity to be activated by removal of solvent molecules. From nearly 4,000 manuscripts, we use natural language processing and automated image analysis to obtain over 2,000 solvent-removal stability measures and 3,000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between stability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to identify limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By training predictive machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial neural network) models to encode the structure-property relationships with graph- and pore-structure-based representations, we are able to make predictions of stability orders of magnitude faster than conventional physics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of important features in ML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies to engineer increased stability into typically unstable 3d-containing MOFs that are frequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach to accelerate the time to discovery of stable, practical MOF materials for a wide range of applications.

**Abstract:** Despite the remarkable performance, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) behave as black-boxes hindering user trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Research on opening black-box DNN can be broadly categorized into post-hoc methods and inherently interpretable DNNs. While many surveys have been conducted on post-hoc interpretation methods, little effort is devoted to inherently interpretable DNNs. This paper provides a review of existing methods to develop DNNs with intrinsic interpretability, with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The aim is to understand the current progress towards fully interpretable DNNs that can cater to different interpretation requirements. Finally, we identify gaps in current work and suggest potential research directions.

**Abstract:** Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined over many correlated outcomes (or "tasks"). For example, scientists may want to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization. However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.

**Abstract:** As machine learning methods are deployed in real-world settings such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it is crucial to recognize how they shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making processes. Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting undesirable representational biases - harmful biases resulting from stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards improving the fairness of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational biases before proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our empirical results and human evaluation demonstrate effectiveness in mitigating bias while retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text generation, thereby pushing forward the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

**Abstract:** Radiographs are used as the most important imaging tool for identifying spine anomalies in clinical practice. The evaluation of spinal bone lesions, however, is a challenging task for radiologists. This work aims at developing and evaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the classification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we build a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies, each of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding boxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then train a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal and a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The VinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies, which is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%, 90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task. These results serve as a proof of concept and set a baseline for future research in this direction. To encourage advances, the dataset, codes, and trained deep learning models are made publicly available.

**Abstract:** The interplay between exploration and exploitation in competitive multi-agent learning is still far from being well understood. Motivated by this, we study smooth Q-learning, a prototypical learning model that explicitly captures the balance between game rewards and exploration costs. We show that Q-learning always converges to the unique quantal-response equilibrium (QRE), the standard solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted zero-sum polymatrix games with heterogeneous learning agents using positive exploration rates. Complementing recent results about convergence in weighted potential games, we show that fast convergence of Q-learning in competitive settings is obtained regardless of the number of agents and without any need for parameter fine-tuning. As showcased by our experiments in network zero-sum games, these theoretical results provide the necessary guarantees for an algorithmic approach to the currently open problem of equilibrium selection in competitive multi-agent settings.

**Abstract:** Implementing embedded neural network processing at the edge requires efficient hardware acceleration that couples high computational performance with low power consumption. Driven by the rapid evolution of network architectures and their algorithmic features, accelerator designs are constantly updated and improved. To evaluate and compare hardware design choices, designers can refer to a myriad of accelerator implementations in the literature. Surveys provide an overview of these works but are often limited to system-level and benchmark-specific performance metrics, making it difficult to quantitatively compare the individual effect of each utilized optimization technique. This complicates the evaluation of optimizations for new accelerator designs, slowing-down the research progress. This work provides a survey of neural network accelerator optimization approaches that have been used in recent works and reports their individual effects on edge processing performance. It presents the list of optimizations and their quantitative effects as a construction kit, allowing to assess the design choices for each building block separately. Reported optimizations range from up to 10'000x memory savings to 33x energy reductions, providing chip designers an overview of design choices for implementing efficient low power neural network accelerators.

**Abstract:** We revisit the problem of tolerant distribution testing. That is, given samples from an unknown distribution $p$ over $\{1, \dots, n\}$, is it $\varepsilon_1$-close to or $\varepsilon_2$-far from a reference distribution $q$ (in total variation distance)? Despite significant interest over the past decade, this problem is well understood only in the extreme cases. In the noiseless setting (i.e., $\varepsilon_1 = 0$) the sample complexity is $Î(\sqrt{n})$, strongly sublinear in the domain size. At the other end of the spectrum, when $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2/2$, the sample complexity jumps to the barely sublinear $Î(n/\log n)$. However, very little is known about the intermediate regime. We fully characterize the price of tolerance in distribution testing as a function of $n$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$, up to a single $\log n$ factor. Specifically, we show the sample complexity to be \[\tilde Î\left(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\varepsilon_2^{2}} + \frac{n}{\log n} \cdot \max \left\{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2},\left(\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2}\right)^{\!\!2}\right\}\right),\] providing a smooth tradeoff between the two previously known cases. We also provide a similar characterization for the problem of tolerant equivalence testing, where both $p$ and $q$ are unknown. Surprisingly, in both cases, the main quantity dictating the sample complexity is the ratio $\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2^2$, and not the more intuitive $\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2$. Of particular technical interest is our lower bound framework, which involves novel approximation-theoretic tools required to handle the asymmetry between $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$, a challenge absent from previous works.

**Abstract:** Recent contrastive representation learning methods rely on estimating mutual information (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can derive multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can split a sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the sequence. Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a strong underestimation bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose decomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation problems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed subviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between the decomposed views. This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our general approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show that DEMI can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed contrastive bounds in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in a vision domain and for dialogue generation.

**Abstract:** It is well-documented that word embeddings trained on large public corpora consistently exhibit known human social biases. Although many methods for debiasing exist, almost all fixate on completely eliminating biased information from the embeddings and often diminish training set size in the process. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for debiasing GloVe word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) which works by incorporating explicit information about training set bias rather than removing biased data outright. Our method runs quickly and efficiently with the help of a fast bias gradient approximation method from Brunet et al. (2019). As our approach is akin to the notion of 'source criticism' in the humanities, we term our method Source-Critical GloVe (SC-GloVe). We show that SC-GloVe reduces the effect size on Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) sets without sacrificing training data or TOP-1 performance.

**Abstract:** The ability to perform causal and counterfactual reasoning are central properties of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g., confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core component of our work is to introduce \textit{agency}, such that it is simple to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges and opportunities for future work.

**Abstract:** Identifying similar mutual funds with respect to the underlying portfolios has found many applications in financial services ranging from fund recommender systems, competitors analysis, portfolio analytics, marketing and sales, etc. The traditional methods are either qualitative, and hence prone to biases and often not reproducible, or, are known not to capture all the nuances (non-linearities) among the portfolios from the raw data. We propose a radically new approach to identify similar funds based on the weighted bipartite network representation of funds and their underlying assets data using a sophisticated machine learning method called Node2Vec which learns an embedded low-dimensional representation of the network. We call the embedding \emph{Fund2Vec}. Ours is the first ever study of the weighted bipartite network representation of the funds-assets network in its original form that identifies structural similarity among portfolios as opposed to merely portfolio overlaps.

**Abstract:** Visual Information Extraction (VIE) task aims to extract key information from multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout. But simply introducing multimodal features couldn't work well when faced with numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities. Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the existing methods.

<p>

**Abstract:** The ability to combine known skills to create new ones may be crucial in the solution of complex reinforcement learning problems that unfold over extended periods. We argue that a robust way of combining skills is to define and manipulate them in the space of pseudo-rewards (or "cumulants"). Based on this premise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of options. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously represented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this insight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to approximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of known options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a set of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any linear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this framework provides a hierarchical interface to the environment whose abstract actions correspond to combinations of basic skills. We demonstrate the practical benefits of our approach in a resource management problem and a navigation task involving a quadrupedal simulated robot.

**Abstract:** End-to-end optimization capability offers neural image compression (NIC) superior lossy compression performance. However, distinct models are required to be trained to reach different points in the rate-distortion (R-D) space. In this paper, we consider the problem of R-D characteristic analysis and modeling for NIC. We make efforts to formulate the essential mathematical functions to describe the R-D behavior of NIC using deep network and statistical modeling. Thus continuous bit-rate points could be elegantly realized by leveraging such model via a single trained network. In this regard, we propose a plugin-in module to learn the relationship between the target bit-rate and the binary representation for the latent variable of auto-encoder. Furthermore, we model the rate and distortion characteristic of NIC as a function of the coding parameter $Î»$ respectively. Our experiments show our proposed method is easy to adopt and obtains competitive coding performance with fixed-rate coding approaches, which would benefit the practical deployment of NIC. In addition, the proposed model could be applied to NIC rate control with limited bit-rate error using a single network.

**Abstract:** We analyze the process of creating word embedding feature representations designed for a learning task when annotated data is scarce, for example, in depressive language detection from Tweets. We start with a rich word embedding pre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with embeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through a simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other more sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder based and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding representations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar semantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations better capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the semantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the general language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our word embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known sentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word embedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine learning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets identification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations achieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied to a high quality dataset. Also, we present several data ablation tests which confirm the efficacy of our augmentation techniques.

**Abstract:** Shapley values provide model agnostic feature attributions for model outcome at a particular instance by simulating feature absence under a global population distribution. The use of a global population can lead to potentially misleading results when local model behaviour is of interest. Hence we consider the formulation of neighbourhood reference distributions that improve the local interpretability of Shapley values. By doing so, we find that the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, a well-studied kernel regressor, can be expressed as a self-normalised importance sampling estimator. Empirically, we observe that Neighbourhood Shapley values identify meaningful sparse feature relevance attributions that provide insight into local model behaviour, complimenting conventional Shapley analysis. They also increase on-manifold explainability and robustness to the construction of adversarial classifiers.

**Abstract:** Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) questionnaire has frequently been used for efficient depression preliminary screening. However, the uncontrollable self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically, facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity. Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling methods.

**Abstract:** Whilst recent neural text-to-speech (TTS) approaches produce high-quality speech, they typically require a large amount of recordings from the target speaker. In previous work, a 3-step method was proposed to generate high-quality TTS while greatly reducing the amount of data required for training. However, we have observed a ceiling effect in the level of naturalness achievable for highly expressive voices when using this approach. In this paper, we present a method for building highly expressive TTS voices with as little as 15 minutes of speech data from the target speaker. Compared to the current state-of-the-art approach, our proposed improvements close the gap to recordings by 23.3% for naturalness of speech and by 16.3% for speaker similarity. Further, we match the naturalness and speaker similarity of a Tacotron2-based full-data (~10 hours) model using only 15 minutes of target speaker data, whereas with 30 minutes or more, we significantly outperform it. The following improvements are proposed: 1) changing from an autoregressive, attention-based TTS model to a non-autoregressive model replacing attention with an external duration model and 2) an additional Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) based fine-tuning step.

**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) collaboratively aggregates a shared global model depending on multiple local clients, while keeping the training data decentralized in order to preserve data privacy. However, standard FL methods ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the aggregated model. In this paper, we first analyze the noisy client statement, and then model noisy clients with different noise distributions (e.g., Bernoulli and truncated Gaussian distributions). To learn with noisy clients, we propose a simple yet effective FL framework, named Federated Noisy Client Learning (Fed-NCL), which is a plug-and-play algorithm and contains two main components: a data quality measurement (DQM) to dynamically quantify the data quality of each participating client, and a noise robust aggregation (NRA) to adaptively aggregate the local models of each client by jointly considering the amount of local training data and the data quality of each client. Our Fed-NCL can be easily applied in any standard FL workflow to handle the noisy client issue. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm boosts the performances of different state-of-the-art systems with noisy clients.

**Abstract:** Super-resolution microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy in spatial resolution. By providing novel spatial or spatio-temporal information on biological processes at nanometer resolution with molecular specificity, it plays an increasingly important role in life sciences. However, its technical limitations require trade-offs to balance its spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and light exposure of samples. Recently, deep learning has achieved breakthrough performance in many image processing and computer vision tasks. It has also shown great promise in pushing the performance envelope of super-resolution microscopy. In this brief Review, we survey recent advances in using deep learning to enhance performance of super-resolution microscopy. We focus primarily on how deep learning ad-vances reconstruction of super-resolution images. Related key technical challenges are discussed. Despite the challenges, deep learning is set to play an indispensable and transformative role in the development of super-resolution microscopy. We conclude with an outlook on how deep learning could shape the future of this new generation of light microscopy technology.

**Abstract:** Leveraging the framework of Optimal Transport, we introduce a new family of generative autoencoders with a learnable prior, called Symmetric Wasserstein Autoencoders (SWAEs). We propose to symmetrically match the joint distributions of the observed data and the latent representation induced by the encoder and the decoder. The resulting algorithm jointly optimizes the modelling losses in both the data and the latent spaces with the loss in the data space leading to the denoising effect. With the symmetric treatment of the data and the latent representation, the algorithm implicitly preserves the local structure of the data in the latent space. To further improve the quality of the latent representation, we incorporate a reconstruction loss into the objective, which significantly benefits both the generation and reconstruction. We empirically show the superior performance of SWAEs over the state-of-the-art generative autoencoders in terms of classification, reconstruction, and generation.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for training monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons: abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al. Secondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations, in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets with no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex environments.

**Abstract:** Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control and generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models, however, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning. This motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot dynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of many robots, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, are described in terms of their SE(3) pose and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation of energy principles. This paper proposes a Hamiltonian formulation over the SE(3) manifold of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) network to approximate the dynamics of a rigid body. In contrast to a black-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees total energy conservation by construction. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the learned, potentially under-actuated SE(3) Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a unified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various platforms, including pendulum, rigid-body, and quadrotor systems.

**Abstract:** Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However, there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models (BERT, GPT-2) as well as current state-of-the-art multimodal causality models.

**Abstract:** Mental health conditions remain underdiagnosed even in countries with common access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications for the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable information) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we study behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile behaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using computational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of mobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app usage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to predict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate representations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate user identity while remaining predictive. By combining multimodal representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward the performance-privacy frontier.

**Abstract:** Current deep learning approaches for diffusion MRI modeling circumvent the need for densely-sampled diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) by directly predicting microstructural indices from sparsely-sampled DWIs. However, they implicitly make unrealistic assumptions of static $q$-space sampling during training and reconstruction. Further, such approaches can restrict downstream usage of variably sampled DWIs for usages including the estimation of microstructural indices or tractography. We propose a generative adversarial translation framework for high-quality DWI synthesis with arbitrary $q$-space sampling given commonly acquired structural images (e.g., B0, T1, T2). Our translation network linearly modulates its internal representations conditioned on continuous $q$-space information, thus removing the need for fixed sampling schemes. Moreover, this approach enables downstream estimation of high-quality microstructural maps from arbitrarily subsampled DWIs, which may be particularly important in cases with sparsely sampled DWIs. Across several recent methodologies, the proposed approach yields improved DWI synthesis accuracy and fidelity with enhanced downstream utility as quantified by the accuracy of scalar microstructure indices estimated from the synthesized images. Code is available at https://github.com/mengweiren/q-space-conditioned-dwi-synthesis.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a shoebox room simulator able to systematically generate synthetic datasets of binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) given an arbitrary set of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The evaluation of machine hearing algorithms frequently requires BRIR datasets in order to simulate the acoustics of any environment. However, currently available solutions typically consider only HRTFs measured on dummy heads, which poorly characterize the high variability in spatial sound perception. Our solution allows to integrate a room impulse response (RIR) simulator with different HRTF sets represented in Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics (SOFA). The source code and the compiled binaries for different operating systems allow to both advanced and non-expert users to benefit from our toolbox, see https://github.com/spatialaudiotools/sofamyroom/ .

**Abstract:** Anime is quite well-received today, especially among the younger generations. With many genres of available shows, more and more people are increasingly getting attracted to this niche section of the entertainment industry. As anime has recently garnered mainstream attention, we have insufficient information regarding users' penchant and watching habits. Therefore, it is an uphill task to build a recommendation engine for this relatively obscure entertainment medium. In this attempt, we have built a novel hybrid recommendation system that could act both as a recommendation system and as a means of exploring new anime genres and titles. We have analyzed the general trends in this field and the users' watching habits for coming up with our efficacious solution. Our solution employs deep autoencoders for the tasks of predicting ratings and generating embeddings. Following this, we formed clusters using the embeddings of the anime titles. These clusters form the search space for anime with similarities and are used to find anime similar to the ones liked and disliked by the user. This method, combined with the predicted ratings, forms the novel hybrid filter. In this article, we have demonstrated this idea and compared the performance of our implemented model with the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

**Abstract:** We study the frontier between learnable and unlearnable hidden Markov models (HMMs). HMMs are flexible tools for clustering dependent data coming from unknown populations. The model parameters are known to be fully identifiable (up to label-switching) without any modeling assumption on the distributions of the populations as soon as the clusters are distinct and the hidden chain is ergodic with a full rank transition matrix. In the limit as any one of these conditions fails, it becomes impossible in general to identify parameters. For a chain with two hidden states we prove nonasymptotic minimax upper and lower bounds, matching up to constants, which exhibit thresholds at which the parameters become learnable. We also provide an upper bound on the relative entropy rate for parameters in a neighbourhood of the unlearnable region which may have interest in itself.

**Abstract:** Low rank matrix recovery problems, including matrix completion and matrix sensing, appear in a broad range of applications. In this work we present GNMR -- an extremely simple iterative algorithm for low rank matrix recovery, based on a Gauss-Newton linearization. On the theoretical front, we derive recovery guarantees for GNMR in both the matrix sensing and matrix completion settings. A key property of GNMR is that it implicitly keeps the factor matrices approximately balanced throughout its iterations. On the empirical front, we show that for matrix completion with uniform sampling, GNMR performs better than several popular methods, especially when given very few observations close to the information limit.

**Abstract:** Recent years have seen stagnating improvements to branch predictor (BP) efficacy and a dearth of fresh ideas in branch predictor design, calling for fresh thinking in this area. This paper argues that looking at BP from the viewpoint of Reinforcement Learning (RL) facilitates systematic reasoning about, and exploration of, BP designs. We describe how to apply the RL formulation to branch predictors, show that existing predictors can be succinctly expressed in this formulation, and study two RL-based variants of conventional BPs.

**Abstract:** Smart Contracts (SCs) in Ethereum can automate tasks and provide different functionalities to a user. Such automation is enabled by the `Turing-complete' nature of the programming language (Solidity) in which SCs are written. This also opens up different vulnerabilities and bugs in SCs that malicious actors exploit to carry out malicious or illegal activities on the cryptocurrency platform. In this work, we study the correlation between malicious activities and the vulnerabilities present in SCs and find that some malicious activities are correlated with certain types of vulnerabilities. We then develop and study the feasibility of a scoring mechanism that corresponds to the severity of the vulnerabilities present in SCs to determine if it is a relevant feature to identify suspicious SCs. We analyze the utility of severity score towards detection of suspicious SCs using unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms across different temporal granularities and identify behavioral changes. In our experiments with on-chain SCs, we were able to find a total of 1094 benign SCs across different granularities which behave similar to malicious SCs, with the inclusion of the smart contract vulnerability scores in the feature set.

**Abstract:** Many modern time-series datasets contain large numbers of output response variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience, the activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations between the output response variables are invariant in the input space. Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint amongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational burden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output dependence. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedures for both SLMM and OSLMM and demonstrate superior model scalability and reduced prediction error of OSLMM compared with state-of-the-art methods on several real-world applications. In neurophysiology recordings, we use the inferred latent functions for compact visualization of population responses to auditory stimuli, and demonstrate superior results compared to a competing method (GPFA). Together, these results demonstrate that OSLMM will be useful for the analysis of diverse, large-scale time-series datasets.

**Abstract:** In situations where explanations of black-box models may be useful, the fairness of the black-box is also often a relevant concern. However, the link between the fairness of the black-box model and the behavior of explanations for the black-box is unclear. We focus on explanations applied to tabular datasets, suggesting that explanations do not necessarily preserve the fairness properties of the black-box algorithm. In other words, explanation algorithms can ignore or obscure critical relevant properties, creating incorrect or misleading explanations. More broadly, we propose future research directions for evaluating and generating explanations such that they are informative and relevant from a fairness perspective.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models that incorporate concept learning as an intermediate step in their decision making process can match the performance of black-box predictive models while retaining the ability to explain outcomes in human understandable terms. However, we demonstrate that the concept representations learned by these models encode information beyond the pre-defined concepts, and that natural mitigation strategies do not fully work, rendering the interpretation of the downstream prediction misleading. We describe the mechanism underlying the information leakage and suggest recourse for mitigating its effects.

**Abstract:** Hypergraphs are used to model higher-order interactions amongst agents and there exist many practically relevant instances of hypergraph datasets. To enable efficient processing of hypergraph-structured data, several hypergraph neural network platforms have been proposed for learning hypergraph properties and structure, with a special focus on node classification. However, almost all existing methods use heuristic propagation rules and offer suboptimal performance on many datasets. We propose AllSet, a new hypergraph neural network paradigm that represents a highly general framework for (hyper)graph neural networks and for the first time implements hypergraph neural network layers as compositions of two multiset functions that can be efficiently learned for each task and each dataset. Furthermore, AllSet draws on new connections between hypergraph neural networks and recent advances in deep learning of multiset functions. In particular, the proposed architecture utilizes Deep Sets and Set Transformer architectures that allow for significant modeling flexibility and offer high expressive power. To evaluate the performance of AllSet, we conduct the most extensive experiments to date involving ten known benchmarking datasets and three newly curated datasets that represent significant challenges for hypergraph node classification. The results demonstrate that AllSet has the unique ability to consistently either match or outperform all other hypergraph neural networks across the tested datasets. Our implementation and dataset will be released upon acceptance.

**Abstract:** Structural features are important features in a geometrical graph. Although there are some correlation analysis of features based on covariance, there is no relevant research on structural feature correlation analysis with graph neural networks. In this paper, we introuduce graph feature to feature (Fea2Fea) prediction pipelines in a low dimensional space to explore some preliminary results on structural feature correlation, which is based on graph neural network. The results show that there exists high correlation between some of the structural features. An irredundant feature combination with initial node features, which is filtered by graph neural network has improved its classification accuracy in some graph-based tasks. We compare differences between concatenation methods on connecting embeddings between features and show that the simplest is the best. We generalize on the synthetic geometric graphs and certify the results on prediction difficulty between structural features.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like Ernie or Bert are currently used in many applications. These models come with a set of pre-trained weights typically obtained in unsupervised/self-supervised modality on a huge amount of data. After that, they are fine-tuned on a specific task. Applications then use these models for inference, and often some additional constraints apply, like low power-budget or low latency between input and output. The main avenue to meet these additional requirements for the inference settings, is to use low precision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost of deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some approaches have been developed to tackle the problem and go beyond the limitations of the PTO (Post-Training Quantization), more specifically the QAT (Quantization Aware Training, see [4]) is a procedure that interferes with the training process in order to make it affected (or simply disturbed) by the quantization phase during the training itself. Besides QAT, recently Intel-Habana Labs have proposed an additional and more direct way to make the training results more robust to subsequent quantization which uses a regularizer, therefore changing the loss function that drives the training procedure. But their proposal does not work out-of-the-box for pre-trained models like Ernie, for example. In this short paper we show why this is not happening (for the Ernie case) and we propose a very basic way to deal with it, sharing as well some initial results (increase in final INT8 accuracy) that might be of interest to practitioners willing to use Ernie in their applications, in low precision regime.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in transformers have enabled Table Question Answering (Table QA) systems to achieve high accuracy and SOTA results on open domain datasets like WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL. Such transformers are frequently pre-trained on open-domain content such as Wikipedia, where they effectively encode questions and corresponding tables from Wikipedia as seen in Table QA dataset. However, web tables in Wikipedia are notably flat in their layout, with the first row as the sole column header. The layout lends to a relational view of tables where each row is a tuple. Whereas, tables in domain-specific business or scientific documents often have a much more complex layout, including hierarchical row and column headers, in addition to having specialized vocabulary terms from that domain.
  To address this problem, we introduce the domain-specific Table QA dataset AIT-QA (Airline Industry Table QA). The dataset consists of 515 questions authored by human annotators on 116 tables extracted from public U.S. SEC filings (publicly available at: https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) of major airline companies for the fiscal years 2017-2019. We also provide annotations pertaining to the nature of questions, marking those that require hierarchical headers, domain-specific terminology, and paraphrased forms. Our zero-shot baseline evaluation of three transformer-based SOTA Table QA methods - TaPAS (end-to-end), TaBERT (semantic parsing-based), and RCI (row-column encoding-based) - clearly exposes the limitation of these methods in this practical setting, with the best accuracy at just 51.8\% (RCI). We also present pragmatic table preprocessing steps used to pivot and project these complex tables into a layout suitable for the SOTA Table QA models.

**Abstract:** The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an efficient simulation technique for computational fluid mechanics and beyond. It is based on a simple stream-and-collide algorithm on Cartesian grids, which is easily compatible with modern machine learning architectures. While it is becoming increasingly clear that deep learning can provide a decisive stimulus for classical simulation techniques, recent studies have not addressed possible connections between machine learning and LBM. Here, we introduce Lettuce, a PyTorch-based LBM code with a threefold aim. Lettuce enables GPU accelerated calculations with minimal source code, facilitates rapid prototyping of LBM models, and enables integrating LBM simulations with PyTorch's deep learning and automatic differentiation facility. As a proof of concept for combining machine learning with the LBM, a neural collision model is developed, trained on a doubly periodic shear layer and then transferred to a different flow, a decaying turbulence. We also exemplify the added benefit of PyTorch's automatic differentiation framework in flow control and optimization. To this end, the spectrum of a forced isotropic turbulence is maintained without further constraining the velocity field. The source code is freely available from https://github.com/lettucecfd/lettuce.

**Abstract:** Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential of utilizing near-term quantum machines to gain certain computational advantages over classical methods. Nevertheless, modern VQAs suffer from cumbersome computational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary quantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the superiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime efficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called QUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central server partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate them to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor and a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes proceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes optimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a sublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration under the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent optimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO can surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the number of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced VQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and applications with quantum advantage.

This work compares three manually created text representations and text embeddings automatically created by AutoML tools. Our benchmark includes four popular open-source AutoML tools and eight datasets for text classification purposes. The results show that straightforward text representations perform better than AutoML tools with automatically created text embeddings.

**Abstract:** Pseudo-normality synthesis, which computationally generates a pseudo-normal image from an abnormal one (e.g., with lesions), is critical in many perspectives, from lesion detection, data augmentation to clinical surgery suggestion. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality pseudo-normal images in the absence of the lesion information. Thus, expensive lesion segmentation data have been introduced to provide lesion information for the generative models and improve the quality of the synthetic images. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the need of a large amount of lesion segmentation data when generating pseudo-normal images. We propose a Semi-supervised Medical Image generative LEarning network (SMILE) which not only utilizes limited medical images with segmentation masks, but also leverages massive medical images without segmentation masks to generate realistic pseudo-normal images. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the best state-of-the-art model by up to 6% for data augmentation task and 3% in generating high-quality images. Moreover, the proposed semi-supervised learning achieves comparable medical image synthesis quality with supervised learning model, using only 50 of segmentation data.

**Abstract:** The use of machine learning algorithms to model user behavior and drive business decisions has become increasingly commonplace, specifically providing intelligent recommendations to automated decision making. This has led to an increase in the use of customers personal data to analyze customer behavior and predict their interests in a companys products. Increased use of this customer personal data can lead to better models but also to the potential of customer data being leaked, reverse engineered, and mishandled. In this paper, we assess differential privacy as a solution to address these privacy problems by building privacy protections into the data engineering and model training stages of predictive model development. Our interest is a pragmatic implementation in an operational environment, which necessitates a general purpose differentially private modeling framework, and we evaluate one such tool from LeapYear as applied to the Credit Risk modeling domain. Credit Risk Model is a major modeling methodology in banking and finance where user data is analyzed to determine the total Expected Loss to the bank.

**Abstract:** The rise in the adoption of blockchain technology has led to increased illegal activities by cyber-criminals costing billions of dollars. Many machine learning algorithms are applied to detect such illegal behavior. These algorithms are often trained on the transaction behavior and, in some cases, trained on the vulnerabilities that exist in the system. In our approach, we study the feasibility of using metadata such as Domain Name (DN) associated with the account in the blockchain and identify whether an account should be tagged malicious or not. Here, we leverage the temporal aspects attached to the DNs. Our results identify 144930 DNs that show malicious behavior, and out of these, 54114 DNs show persistent malicious behavior over time. Nonetheless, none of these identified malicious DNs were reported in new officially tagged malicious blockchain DNs.

**Abstract:** Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS) applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate independent crop growth drivers and capture their varying importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa for the period 2003-2019, with USDA crop progress reports used as ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutfliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.

**Abstract:** The application of infrared hyperspectral imagery to geological problems is becoming more popular as data become more accessible and cost-effective. Clustering and classifying spectrally similar materials is often a first step in applications ranging from economic mineral exploration on Earth to planetary exploration on Mars. Semi-manual classification guided by expertly developed spectral parameters can be time consuming and biased, while supervised methods require abundant labeled data and can be difficult to generalize. Here we develop a fully unsupervised workflow for feature extraction and clustering informed by both expert spectral geologist input and quantitative metrics. Our pipeline uses a lightweight autoencoder followed by Gaussian mixture modeling to map the spectral diversity within any image. We validate the performance of our pipeline at submillimeter-scale with expert-labelled data from the Oman ophiolite drill core and evaluate performance at meters-scale with partially classified orbital data of Jezero Crater on Mars (the landing site for the Perseverance rover). We additionally examine the effects of various preprocessing techniques used in traditional analysis of hyperspectral imagery. This pipeline provides a fast and accurate clustering map of similar geological materials and consistently identifies and separates major mineral classes in both laboratory imagery and remote sensing imagery. We refer to our pipeline as "Generalized Pipeline for Spectroscopic Unsupervised clustering of Minerals (GyPSUM)."

**Abstract:** This article introduces byteSteady -- a fast model for classification using byte-level n-gram embeddings. byteSteady assumes that each input comes as a sequence of bytes. A representation vector is produced using the averaged embedding vectors of byte-level n-grams, with a pre-defined set of n. The hashing trick is used to reduce the number of embedding vectors. This input representation vector is then fed into a linear classifier. A straightforward application of byteSteady is text classification. We also apply byteSteady to one type of non-language data -- DNA sequences for gene classification. For both problems we achieved competitive classification results against strong baselines, suggesting that byteSteady can be applied to both language and non-language data. Furthermore, we find that simple compression using Huffman coding does not significantly impact the results, which offers an accuracy-speed trade-off previously unexplored in machine learning.

**Abstract:** Physics perception very often faces the problem that only limited data or partial measurements on the scene are available. In this work, we propose a strategy to learn the full state of sloshing liquids from measurements of the free surface. Our approach is based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) that project the limited information available to a reduced-order manifold so as to not only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of performing fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain physically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the reduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the fulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the required hidden information to correlate the limited information with the latent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back to the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful information in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a computer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with real information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting future states of the observed fluid in real-time.

**Abstract:** We compare variational image registration in consectutive and re-stained sections from histopathology. We present a fully-automatic algorithm for non-parametric (nonlinear) image registration and apply it to a previously existing dataset from the ANHIR challenge (230 slide pairs, consecutive sections) and a new dataset (hybrid re-stained and consecutive, 81 slide pairs, ca. 3000 landmarks) which is made publicly available. Registration hyperparameters are obtained in the ANHIR dataset and applied to the new dataset without modification. In the new dataset, landmark errors after registration range from 13.2 micrometers for consecutive sections to 1 micrometer for re-stained sections. We observe that non-parametric registration leads to lower landmark errors in both cases, even though the effect is smaller in re-stained sections. The nucleus-level alignment after non-parametric registration of re-stained sections provides a valuable tool to generate automatic ground-truth for machine learning applications in histopathology.

**Abstract:** Since the first coronavirus case was identified in the U.S. on Jan. 21, more than 1 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of COVID-19. This infectious respiratory disease has spread rapidly across more than 3000 counties and 50 states in the U.S. and have exhibited evolutionary clustering and complex triggering patterns. It is essential to understand the complex spacetime intertwined propagation of this disease so that accurate prediction or smart external intervention can be carried out. In this paper, we model the propagation of the COVID-19 as spatio-temporal point processes and propose a generative and intensity-free model to track the spread of the disease. We further adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn the model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based learning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover, the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more scalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning performance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social distancing policy based on the learned generative model.

**Abstract:** The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during the past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning from the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been built to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto diagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population that satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This study presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic pre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset, followed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The semantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage, and the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter modification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data scarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small patient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with more than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic pre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving more than 10\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In addition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer learned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future healthcare model pre-training across institutions.

**Abstract:** Federated learning is emerging as a machine learning technique that trains a model across multiple decentralized parties. It is renowned for preserving privacy as the data never leaves the computational devices, and recent approaches further enhance its privacy by hiding messages transferred in encryption. However, we found that despite the efforts, federated learning remains privacy-threatening, due to its interactive nature across different parties. In this paper, we analyze the privacy threats in industrial-level federated learning frameworks with secure computation, and reveal such threats widely exist in typical machine learning models such as linear regression, logistic regression and decision tree. For the linear and logistic regression, we show through theoretical analysis that it is possible for the attacker to invert the entire private input of the victim, given very few information. For the decision tree model, we launch an attack to infer the range of victim's private inputs. All attacks are evaluated on popular federated learning frameworks and real-world datasets.

**Abstract:** We present a new, stochastic variant of the projective splitting (PS) family of algorithms for monotone inclusion problems. It can solve min-max and noncooperative game formulations arising in applications such as robust ML without the convergence issues associated with gradient descent-ascent, the current de facto standard approach in such situations. Our proposal is the first version of PS able to use stochastic (as opposed to deterministic) gradient oracles. It is also the first stochastic method that can solve min-max games while easily handling multiple constraints and nonsmooth regularizers via projection and proximal operators. We close with numerical experiments on a distributionally robust sparse logistic regression problem.

**Abstract:** Shared feature spaces for actor-critic methods aims to capture generalized latent representations to be used by the policy and value function with the hopes for a more stable and sample-efficient optimization. However, such a paradigm present a number of challenges in practice, as parameters generating a shared representation must learn off two distinct objectives, resulting in competing updates and learning perturbations. In this paper, we present a novel feature-sharing framework to address these difficulties by introducing the mix and mask mechanisms and the distributional scalarization technique. These mechanisms behaves dynamically to couple and decouple connected latent features variably between the policy and value function, while the distributional scalarization standardizes the two objectives using a probabilistic standpoint. From our experimental results, we demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to alternative methods using separate networks and networks with a shared backbone.

**Abstract:** Motivated by cutting-edge applications like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $Ï$. Despite significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime $Ï\gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $Ï^6$ for certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast to the traditional $Ï^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this paper, we show that \emph{sparse} signals exhibit an intermediate $Ï^4$ sample complexity even in the classical MRA model. Our results explore and exploit connections of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in applied mathematics: the \textit{beltway problem} from combinatorial optimization, and \textit{uniform uncertainty principles} from harmonic analysis.

**Abstract:** The significant increase in the number of individuals with chronic ailments (including the elderly and disabled) has dictated an urgent need for an innovative model for healthcare systems. The evolved model will be more personalized and less reliant on traditional brick-and-mortar healthcare institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, and long-term healthcare centers. The smart healthcare system is a topic of recently growing interest and has become increasingly required due to major developments in modern technologies, especially in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This paper is aimed to discuss the current state-of-the-art smart healthcare systems highlighting major areas like wearable and smartphone devices for health monitoring, machine learning for disease diagnosis, and the assistive frameworks, including social robots developed for the ambient assisted living environment. Additionally, the paper demonstrates software integration architectures that are very significant to create smart healthcare systems, integrating seamlessly the benefit of data analytics and other tools of AI. The explained developed systems focus on several facets: the contribution of each developed framework, the detailed working procedure, the performance as outcomes, and the comparative merits and limitations. The current research challenges with potential future directions are addressed to highlight the drawbacks of existing systems and the possible methods to introduce novel frameworks, respectively. This review aims at providing comprehensive insights into the recent developments of smart healthcare systems to equip experts to contribute to the field.

**Abstract:** Multifidelity simulation methodologies are often used in an attempt to judiciously combine low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation results in an accuracy-increasing, cost-saving way. Candidates for this approach are simulation methodologies for which there are fidelity differences connected with significant computational cost differences. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are candidates for these types of approaches due to the significant difference in training times required when different fidelities (expressed in terms of architecture width and depth as well as optimization criteria) are employed. In this paper, we propose a particular multifidelity approach applied to PINNs that exploits low-rank structure. We demonstrate that width, depth, and optimization criteria can be used as parameters related to model fidelity, and show numerical justification of cost differences in training due to fidelity parameter choices. We test our multifidelity scheme on various canonical forward PDE models that have been presented in the emerging PINNs literature.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a perception-action-communication loop design using Vision-based Graph Aggregation and Inference (VGAI). This multi-agent decentralized learning-to-control framework maps raw visual observations to agent actions, aided by local communication among neighboring agents. Our framework is implemented by a cascade of a convolutional and a graph neural network (CNN / GNN), addressing agent-level visual perception and feature learning, as well as swarm-level communication, local information aggregation and agent action inference, respectively. By jointly training the CNN and GNN, image features and communication messages are learned in conjunction to better address the specific task. We use imitation learning to train the VGAI controller in an offline phase, relying on a centralized expert controller. This results in a learned VGAI controller that can be deployed in a distributed manner for online execution. Additionally, the controller exhibits good scaling properties, with training in smaller teams and application in larger teams. Through a multi-agent flocking application, we demonstrate that VGAI yields performance comparable to or better than other decentralized controllers, using only the visual input modality and without accessing precise location or motion state information.

**Abstract:** Previous blind or No Reference (NR) video quality assessment (VQA) models largely rely on features drawn from natural scene statistics (NSS), but under the assumption that the image statistics are stationary in the spatial domain. Several of these models are quite successful on standard pictures. However, in Virtual Reality (VR) applications, foveated video compression is regaining attention, and the concept of space-variant quality assessment is of interest, given the availability of increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution contents and practical ways of measuring gaze direction. Distortions from foveated video compression increase with increased eccentricity, implying that the natural scene statistics are space-variant. Towards advancing the development of foveated compression / streaming algorithms, we have devised a no-reference (NR) foveated video quality assessment model, called FOVQA, which is based on new models of space-variant natural scene statistics (NSS) and natural video statistics (NVS). Specifically, we deploy a space-variant generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-GGD) model and a space-variant asynchronous generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-AGGD) model of mean subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficients and products of neighboring MSCN coefficients, respectively. We devise a foveated video quality predictor that extracts radial basis features, and other features that capture perceptually annoying rapid quality fall-offs. We find that FOVQA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the new 2D LIVE-FBT-FCVR database, as compared with other leading FIQA / VQA models. we have made our implementation of FOVQA available at: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/Quality/FOVQA.zip.

**Abstract:** We present our entry into the 2021 3C Shared Task Citation Context Classification based on Purpose competition. The goal of the competition is to classify a citation in a scientific article based on its purpose. This task is important because it could potentially lead to more comprehensive ways of summarizing the purpose and uses of scientific articles, but it is also difficult, mainly due to the limited amount of available training data in which the purposes of each citation have been hand-labeled, along with the subjectivity of these labels. Our entry in the competition is a multi-task model that combines multiple modules designed to handle the problem from different perspectives, including hand-generated linguistic features, TF-IDF features, and an LSTM-with-attention model. We also provide an ablation study and feature analysis whose insights could lead to future work.

**Abstract:** One-class learning is the classic problem of fitting a model to the data for which annotations are available only for a single class. In this paper, we explore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to as Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to learn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data distribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the classifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the other. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier decision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame and seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting objectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii) to maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal frames will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows for efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a minimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing the data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under different constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized feature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via experiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as anomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We also explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via experiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** This paper describes a new library for learning Bayesian networks from data containing discrete and continuous variables (mixed data). In addition to the classical learning methods on discretized data, this library proposes its algorithm that allows structural learning and parameters learning from mixed data without discretization since data discretization leads to information loss. This algorithm based on mixed MI score function for structural learning, and also linear regression and Gaussian distribution approximation for parameters learning. The library also offers two algorithms for enumerating graph structures - the greedy Hill-Climbing algorithm and the evolutionary algorithm. Thus the key capabilities of the proposed library are as follows: (1) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on discretized data, (2) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on mixed data using the MI mixed score function and Gaussian approximation, (3) launching learning algorithms on one of two algorithms for enumerating graph structures - Hill-Climbing and the evolutionary algorithm. Since the need for mixed data representation comes from practical necessity, the advantages of our implementations are evaluated in the context of solving approximation and gap recovery problems on synthetic data and real datasets.

**Abstract:** On any given day, tens of millions of people find themselves trapped in instances of modern slavery. The terms "human trafficking," "trafficking in persons," and "modern slavery" are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to both sex trafficking and forced labor. Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker compels someone to provide labor or services through the use of force, fraud, and/or coercion. The wide range of stakeholders in human trafficking presents major challenges. Direct stakeholders are law enforcement, NGOs and INGOs, businesses, local/planning government authorities, and survivors. Viewed from a very high level, all stakeholders share in a rich network of interactions that produce and consume enormous amounts of information. The problems of making efficient use of such information for the purposes of fighting trafficking while at the same time adhering to community standards of privacy and ethics are formidable. At the same time they help us, technologies that increase surveillance of populations can also undermine basic human rights.
  In early March 2020, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), in collaboration with the Code 8.7 Initiative, brought together over fifty members of the computing research community along with anti-slavery practitioners and survivors to lay out a research roadmap. The primary goal was to explore ways in which long-range research in artificial intelligence (AI) could be applied to the fight against human trafficking. Building on the kickoff Code 8.7 conference held at the headquarters of the United Nations in February 2019, the focus for this workshop was to link the ambitious goals outlined in the A 20-Year Community Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Research in the US (AI Roadmap) to challenges vital in achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7, the elimination of modern slavery.

**Abstract:** Computational virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) with density functional theory (DFT) and machine-learning (ML)-acceleration is essential in rapid materials discovery. By necessity, efficient DFT-based workflows are carried out with a single density functional approximation (DFA). Nevertheless, properties evaluated with different DFAs can be expected to disagree for the cases with challenging electronic structure (e.g., open shell transition metal complexes, TMCs) for which rapid screening is most needed and accurate benchmarks are often unavailable. To quantify the effect of DFA bias, we introduce an approach to rapidly obtain property predictions from 23 representative DFAs spanning multiple families and "rungs" (e.g., semi-local to double hybrid) and basis sets on over 2,000 TMCs. Although computed properties (e.g., spin-state ordering and frontier orbital gap) naturally differ by DFA, high linear correlations persist across all DFAs. We train independent ML models for each DFA and observe convergent trends in feature importance; these features thus provide DFA-invariant, universal design rules. We devise a strategy to train ML models informed by all 23 DFAs and use them to predict properties (e.g., spin-splitting energy) of over 182k TMCs. By requiring consensus of the ANN-predicted DFA properties, we improve correspondence of these computational lead compounds with literature-mined, experimental compounds over the single-DFA approach typically employed. Both feature analysis and consensus-based ML provide efficient, alternative paths to overcome accuracy limitations of practical DFT.

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning algorithms require large and diverse datasets in order to learn successful policies for perception-based mobile navigation. However, gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively expensive. Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with possibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data collection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot at test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms conventional hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.

**Abstract:** Ambiguity is a characteristic of natural language, which makes expression ideas flexible. However, in a domain that requires accurate statements, it becomes a barrier. Specifically, a single word can have many meanings and multiple words can have the same meaning. When translating a text into a foreign language, the translator needs to determine the exact meaning of each element in the original sentence to produce the correct translation sentence. From that observation, in this paper, we propose ParaLaw Nets, a pretrained model family using sentence-level cross-lingual information to reduce ambiguity and increase the performance in legal text processing. This approach achieved the best result in the Question Answering task of COLIEE-2021.

**Abstract:** The phenomenon of adversarial examples in deep learning models has caused substantial concern over their reliability. While many deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in terms of predictive accuracy, it has been shown that in many instances an imperceptible perturbation can falsely flip the network's prediction. Most research has then focused on developing defenses against adversarial attacks or learning under a worst-case adversarial loss. In this work, we take a step back and aim to provide a framework for determining whether a model's label change under small perturbation is justified (and when it is not). We carefully argue that adversarial robustness should be defined as a locally adaptive measure complying with the underlying distribution. We then suggest a definition for an adaptive robust loss, derive an empirical version of it, and develop a resulting data-augmentation framework. We prove that our adaptive data-augmentation maintains consistency of 1-nearest neighbor classification under deterministic labels and provide illustrative empirical evaluations.

**Abstract:** We introduce a neural relighting algorithm for captured indoors scenes, that allows interactive free-viewpoint navigation. Our method allows illumination to be changed synthetically, while coherently rendering cast shadows and complex glossy materials. We start with multiple images of the scene and a 3D mesh obtained by multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction. We assume that lighting is well-explained as the sum of a view-independent diffuse component and a view-dependent glossy term concentrated around the mirror reflection direction. We design a convolutional network around input feature maps that facilitate learning of an implicit representation of scene materials and illumination, enabling both relighting and free-viewpoint navigation. We generate these input maps by exploiting the best elements of both image-based and physically-based rendering. We sample the input views to estimate diffuse scene irradiance, and compute the new illumination caused by user-specified light sources using path tracing. To facilitate the network's understanding of materials and synthesize plausible glossy reflections, we reproject the views and compute mirror images. We train the network on a synthetic dataset where each scene is also reconstructed with MVS. We show results of our algorithm relighting real indoor scenes and performing free-viewpoint navigation with complex and realistic glossy reflections, which so far remained out of reach for view-synthesis techniques.

**Abstract:** Warming oceans due to climate change are leading to increased numbers of ectoparasitic copepods, also known as sea lice, which can cause significant ecological loss to wild salmon populations and major economic loss to aquaculture sites. The main transport mechanism driving the spread of sea lice populations are near-surface ocean currents. Present strategies to estimate the distribution of sea lice larvae are computationally complex and limit full-scale analysis. Motivated to address this challenge, we propose SALT: Sea lice Adaptive Lattice Tracking approach for efficient estimation of sea lice dispersion and distribution in space and time. Specifically, an adaptive spatial mesh is generated by merging nodes in the lattice graph of the Ocean Model based on local ocean properties, thus enabling highly efficient graph representation. SALT demonstrates improved efficiency while maintaining consistent results with the standard method, using near-surface current data for Hardangerfjord, Norway. The proposed SALT technique shows promise for enhancing proactive aquaculture management through predictive modelling of sea lice infestation pressure maps in a changing climate.
