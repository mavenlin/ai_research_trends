**Abstract:** Machine learning is a modern approach to problem-solving and task automation. In particular, machine learning is concerned with the development and applications of algorithms that can recognize patterns in data and use them for predictive modeling. Artificial neural networks are a particular class of machine learning algorithms and models that evolved into what is now described as deep learning. Given the computational advances made in the last decade, deep learning can now be applied to massive data sets and in innumerable contexts. Therefore, deep learning has become its own subfield of machine learning. In the context of biological research, it has been increasingly used to derive novel insights from high-dimensional biological data. To make the biological applications of deep learning more accessible to scientists who have some experience with machine learning, we solicited input from a community of researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests. These individuals collaboratively contributed to this manuscript's writing using the GitHub version control platform and the Manubot manuscript generation toolset. The goal was to articulate a practical, accessible, and concise set of guidelines and suggestions to follow when using deep learning. In the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying machine learning fundamentals as a baseline for utilizing deep learning, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated by deep learning, among others.

**Abstract:** In the past decade the mathematical theory of machine learning has lagged far behind the triumphs of deep neural networks on practical challenges. However, the gap between theory and practice is gradually starting to close. In this paper I will attempt to assemble some pieces of the remarkable and still incomplete mathematical mosaic emerging from the efforts to understand the foundations of deep learning. The two key themes will be interpolation, and its sibling, over-parameterization. Interpolation corresponds to fitting data, even noisy data, exactly. Over-parameterization enables interpolation and provides flexibility to select a right interpolating model.
  As we will see, just as a physical prism separates colors mixed within a ray of light, the figurative prism of interpolation helps to disentangle generalization and optimization properties within the complex picture of modern Machine Learning. This article is written with belief and hope that clearer understanding of these issues brings us a step closer toward a general theory of deep learning and machine learning.

**Abstract:** Tables present important information concisely in many scientific documents. Visual features like mathematical symbols, equations, and spanning cells make structure and content extraction from tables embedded in research documents difficult. This paper discusses the dataset, tasks, participants' methods, and results of the ICDAR 2021 Competition on Scientific Table Image Recognition to LaTeX. Specifically, the task of the competition is to convert a tabular image to its corresponding LaTeX source code. We proposed two subtasks. In Subtask 1, we ask the participants to reconstruct the LaTeX structure code from an image. In Subtask 2, we ask the participants to reconstruct the LaTeX content code from an image. This report describes the datasets and ground truth specification, details the performance evaluation metrics used, presents the final results, and summarizes the participating methods. Submission by team VCGroup got the highest Exact Match accuracy score of 74% for Subtask 1 and 55% for Subtask 2, beating previous baselines by 5% and 12%, respectively. Although improvements can still be made to the recognition capabilities of models, this competition contributes to the development of fully automated table recognition systems by challenging practitioners to solve problems under specific constraints and sharing their approaches; the platform will remain available for post-challenge submissions at https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/26979 .

**Abstract:** We study a theory of reinforcement learning (RL) in which the learner receives binary feedback only once at the end of an episode. While this is an extreme test case for theory, it is also arguably more representative of real-world applications than the traditional requirement in RL practice that the learner receive feedback at every time step. Indeed, in many real-world applications of reinforcement learning, such as self-driving cars and robotics, it is easier to evaluate whether a learner's complete trajectory was either "good" or "bad," but harder to provide a reward signal at each step. To show that learning is possible in this more challenging setting, we study the case where trajectory labels are generated by an unknown parametric model, and provide a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sub-linear regret.

**Abstract:** Injecting external domain-specific knowledge (e.g., UMLS) into pretrained language models (LMs) advances their capability to handle specialised in-domain tasks such as biomedical entity linking (BEL). However, such abundant expert knowledge is available only for a handful of languages (e.g., English). In this work, by proposing a novel cross-lingual biomedical entity linking task (XL-BEL) and establishing a new XL-BEL benchmark spanning 10 typologically diverse languages, we first investigate the ability of standard knowledge-agnostic as well as knowledge-enhanced monolingual and multilingual LMs beyond the standard monolingual English BEL task. The scores indicate large gaps to English performance. We then address the challenge of transferring domain-specific knowledge in resource-rich languages to resource-poor ones. To this end, we propose and evaluate a series of cross-lingual transfer methods for the XL-BEL task, and demonstrate that general-domain bitext helps propagate the available English knowledge to languages with little to no in-domain data. Remarkably, we show that our proposed domain-specific transfer methods yield consistent gains across all target languages, sometimes up to 20 Precision@1 points, without any in-domain knowledge in the target language, and without any in-domain parallel data.

**Abstract:** Translation between natural language and source code can help software development by enabling developers to comprehend, ideate, search, and write computer programs in natural language. Despite growing interest from the industry and the research community, this task is often difficult due to the lack of large standard datasets suitable for training deep neural models, standard noise removal methods, and evaluation benchmarks. This leaves researchers to collect new small-scale datasets, resulting in inconsistencies across published works. In this study, we present CoDesc -- a large parallel dataset composed of 4.2 million Java methods and natural language descriptions. With extensive analysis, we identify and remove prevailing noise patterns from the dataset. We demonstrate the proficiency of CoDesc in two complementary tasks for code-description pairs: code summarization and code search. We show that the dataset helps improve code search by up to 22\% and achieves the new state-of-the-art in code summarization. Furthermore, we show CoDesc's effectiveness in pre-training--fine-tuning setup, opening possibilities in building pretrained language models for Java. To facilitate future research, we release the dataset, a data processing tool, and a benchmark at \url{https://github.com/csebuetnlp/CoDesc}.

**Abstract:** Following procedural texts written in natural languages is challenging. We must read the whole text to identify the relevant information or identify the instruction flows to complete a task, which is prone to failures. If such texts are structured, we can readily visualize instruction-flows, reason or infer a particular step, or even build automated systems to help novice agents achieve a goal. However, this structure recovery task is a challenge because of such texts' diverse nature. This paper proposes to identify relevant information from such texts and generate information flows between sentences. We built a large annotated procedural text dataset (CTFW) in the cybersecurity domain (3154 documents). This dataset contains valuable instructions regarding software vulnerability analysis experiences. We performed extensive experiments on CTFW with our LM-GNN model variants in multiple settings. To show the generalizability of both this task and our method, we also experimented with procedural texts from two other domains (Maintenance Manual and Cooking), which are substantially different from cybersecurity. Our experiments show that Graph Convolution Network with BERT sentence embeddings outperforms BERT in all three domains

**Abstract:** To help individuals express themselves better, quotation recommendation is receiving growing attention. Nevertheless, most prior efforts focus on modeling quotations and queries separately and ignore the relationship between the quotations and the queries. In this work, we introduce a transformation matrix that directly maps the query representations to quotation representations. To better learn the mapping relationship, we employ a mapping loss that minimizes the distance of two semantic spaces (one for quotation and another for mapped-query). Furthermore, we explore using the words in history queries to interpret the figurative language of quotations, where quotation-aware attention is applied on top of history queries to highlight the indicator words. Experiments on two datasets in English and Chinese show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.

**Abstract:** Ensembles of independently trained neural networks are a state-of-the-art approach to estimate predictive uncertainty in Deep Learning, and can be interpreted as an approximation of the posterior distribution via a mixture of delta functions. The training of ensembles relies on non-convexity of the loss landscape and random initialization of their individual members, making the resulting posterior approximation uncontrolled. This paper proposes a novel and principled method to tackle this limitation, minimizing an $f$-divergence between the true posterior and a kernel density estimator in a function space. We analyze this objective from a combinatorial point of view, and show that it is submodular with respect to mixture components for any $f$. Subsequently, we consider the problem of ensemble construction, and from the marginal gain of the total objective, we derive a novel diversity term for training ensembles greedily. The performance of our approach is demonstrated on computer vision out-of-distribution detection benchmarks in a range of architectures trained on multiple datasets. The source code of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/MIPT-Oulu/greedy_ensembles_training.

**Abstract:** To effectively perform the task of next-word prediction, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) must keep track of many types of information. Some information is directly related to the next word's identity, but some is more secondary (e.g. discourse-level features or features of downstream words). Correlates of secondary information appear in LSTM representations even though they are not part of an \emph{explicitly} supervised prediction task. In contrast, in reinforcement learning (RL), techniques that explicitly supervise representations to predict secondary information have been shown to be beneficial. Inspired by that success, we propose Predictive Representation Learning (PRL), which explicitly constrains LSTMs to encode specific predictions, like those that might need to be learned implicitly. We show that PRL 1) significantly improves two strong language modeling methods, 2) converges more quickly, and 3) performs better when data is limited. Our work shows that explicitly encoding a simple predictive task facilitates the search for a more effective language model.

**Abstract:** Finding parameters in a deep neural network (NN) that fit training data is a nonconvex optimization problem, but a basic first-order optimization method (gradient descent) finds a global optimizer with perfect fit (zero-loss) in many practical situations. We examine this phenomenon for the case of Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) with smooth activation functions in a limiting regime in which both the number of layers (depth) and the number of weights in each layer (width) go to infinity. First, we use a mean-field-limit argument to prove that the gradient descent for parameter training becomes a gradient flow for a probability distribution that is characterized by a partial differential equation (PDE) in the large-NN limit. Next, we show that under certain assumptions, the solution to the PDE converges in the training time to a zero-loss solution. Together, these results suggest that the training of the ResNet gives a near-zero loss if the ResNet is large enough. We give estimates of the depth and width needed to reduce the loss below a given threshold, with high probability.

**Abstract:** Measuring public opinion is a key focus during democratic elections, enabling candidates to gauge their popularity and alter their campaign strategies accordingly. Traditional survey polling remains the most popular estimation technique, despite its cost and time intensity, measurement errors, lack of real-time capabilities and lagged representation of public opinion. In recent years, Twitter opinion mining has attempted to combat these issues. Despite achieving promising results, it experiences its own set of shortcomings such as an unrepresentative sample population and a lack of long term stability. This paper aims to merge data from both these techniques using Bayesian data assimilation to arrive at a more accurate estimate of true public opinion for the Brexit referendum. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach using Twitter opinion data and survey data from trusted pollsters. Firstly, the possible existence of a time gap of 16 days between the two data sets is identified. This gap is subsequently incorporated into a proposed assimilation architecture. This method was found to adequately incorporate information from both sources and measure a strong upward trend in Leave support leading up to the Brexit referendum. The proposed technique provides useful estimates of true opinion, which is essential to future opinion measurement and forecasting research.

**Abstract:** Recent researches show that deep learning model is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Many defenses against backdoor attacks have been proposed. However, existing defense works require high computational overhead or backdoor attack information such as the trigger size, which is difficult to satisfy in realistic scenarios. In this paper, a novel backdoor detection method based on adversarial examples is proposed. The proposed method leverages intentional adversarial perturbations to detect whether an image contains a trigger, which can be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage (sanitize the training set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference stage). Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is added to the image intentionally. If the prediction of the model on the perturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image, the input image will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing defense works, the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low computational resources and maintains the visual quality of the images. Experimental results show that, the backdoor detection rate of the proposed defense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively. Besides, the proposed method maintains the visual quality of the image as the l2 norm of the added perturbation are as low as 2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively. In addition, it is also demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different attack settings (trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern). Compared with the existing defense work (STRIP), the proposed method has better detection performance on all the three datasets, and is more efficient than STRIP.

**Abstract:** Common compartmental modeling for COVID-19 is based on a priori knowledge and numerous assumptions. Additionally, they do not systematically incorporate asymptomatic cases. Our study aimed at providing a framework for data-driven approaches, by leveraging the strengths of the grey-box system theory or grey-box identification, known for its robustness in problem solving under partial, incomplete, or uncertain data. Empirical data on confirmed cases and deaths, extracted from an open source repository were used to develop the SEAIRD compartment model. Adjustments were made to fit current knowledge on the COVID-19 behavior. The model was implemented and solved using an Ordinary Differential Equation solver and an optimization tool. A cross-validation technique was applied, and the coefficient of determination $R^2$ was computed in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. %to the data. Key epidemiological parameters were finally estimated and we provided the rationale for the construction of SEAIRD model. When applied to Brazil's cases, SEAIRD produced an excellent agreement to the data, with an %coefficient of determination $R^2$ $\geq 90\%$. The probability of COVID-19 transmission was generally high ($\geq 95\%$). On the basis of a 20-day modeling data, the incidence rate of COVID-19 was as low as 3 infected cases per 100,000 exposed persons in Brazil and France. Within the same time frame, the fatality rate of COVID-19 was the highest in France (16.4\%) followed by Brazil (6.9\%), and the lowest in Russia ($\leq 1\%$). SEAIRD represents an asset for modeling infectious diseases in their dynamical stable phase, especially for new viruses when pathophysiology knowledge is very limited.

**Abstract:** We posit a new mechanism for cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based upon any nonlinear function of the team's long-term state-action occupancy measure, i.e., a \emph{general utility}. This subsumes the cumulative return but also allows one to incorporate risk-sensitivity, exploration, and priors. % We derive the {\bf D}ecentralized {\bf S}hadow Reward {\bf A}ctor-{\bf C}ritic (DSAC) in which agents alternate between policy evaluation (critic), weighted averaging with neighbors (information mixing), and local gradient updates for their policy parameters (actor). DSAC augments the classic critic step by requiring agents to (i) estimate their local occupancy measure in order to (ii) estimate the derivative of the local utility with respect to their occupancy measure, i.e., the "shadow reward". DSAC converges to $Îµ$-stationarity in $\mathcal{O}(1/Îµ^{2.5})$ (Theorem \ref{theorem:final}) or faster $\mathcal{O}(1/Îµ^{2})$ (Corollary \ref{corollary:communication}) steps with high probability, depending on the amount of communications. We further establish the non-existence of spurious stationary points for this problem, that is, DSAC finds the globally optimal policy (Corollary \ref{corollary:global}). Experiments demonstrate the merits of goals beyond the cumulative return in cooperative MARL.

**Abstract:** How do social networks differ across platforms? How do information networks change over time? Answering questions like these requires us to compare two or more graphs. This task is commonly treated as a measurement problem, but numerical answers give limited insight. Here, we argue that if the goal is to gain understanding, we should treat graph similarity assessment as a description problem instead. We formalize this problem as a model selection task using the Minimum Description Length principle, capturing the similarity of the input graphs in a common model and the differences between them in transformations to individual models. To discover good models, we propose Momo, which breaks the problem into two parts and introduces efficient algorithms for each. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world graphs, we confirm that Momo works well in practice.

**Abstract:** Dynamical systems in which local interactions among agents give rise to complex emerging phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society. This work explores the problem of inferring the unknown interaction structure (represented as a graph) of such a system from measurements of its constituent agents or individual components (represented as nodes). We consider a setting where the underlying dynamical model is unknown and where different measurements (i.e., snapshots) may be independent (e.g., may stem from different experiments). We propose GINA (Graph Inference Network Architecture), a graph neural network (GNN) to simultaneously learn the latent interaction graph and, conditioned on the interaction graph, the prediction of a node's observable state based on adjacent vertices. GINA is based on the hypothesis that the ground truth interaction graph -- among all other potential graphs -- allows to predict the state of a node, given the states of its neighbors, with the highest accuracy. We test this hypothesis and demonstrate GINA's effectiveness on a wide range of interaction graphs and dynamical processes.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study multi-dimensional image recovery. Recently, transform-based tensor nuclear norm minimization methods are considered to capture low-rank tensor structures to recover third-order tensors in multi-dimensional image processing applications. The main characteristic of such methods is to perform the linear transform along the third mode of third-order tensors, and then compute tensor nuclear norm minimization on the transformed tensor so that the underlying low-rank tensors can be recovered. The main aim of this paper is to propose a nonlinear multilayer neural network to learn a nonlinear transform via the observed tensor data under self-supervision. The proposed network makes use of low-rank representation of transformed tensors and data-fitting between the observed tensor and the reconstructed tensor to construct the nonlinear transformation. Extensive experimental results on tensor completion, background subtraction, robust tensor completion, and snapshot compressive imaging are presented to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** The bandit problem with graph feedback, proposed in [Mannor and Shamir, NeurIPS 2011], is modeled by a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ where $V$ is the collection of bandit arms, and once an arm is triggered, all its incident arms are observed. A fundamental question is how the structure of the graph affects the min-max regret. We propose the notions of the fractional weak domination number $Î´^*$ and the $k$-packing independence number capturing upper bound and lower bound for the regret respectively. We show that the two notions are inherently connected via aligning them with the linear program of the weakly dominating set and its dual -- the fractional vertex packing set respectively. Based on this connection, we utilize the strong duality theorem to prove a general regret upper bound $O\left(\left( Î´^*\log |V|\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$ and a lower bound $Î©\left(\left(Î´^*/Î±\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)$ where $Î±$ is the integrality gap of the dual linear program. Therefore, our bounds are tight up to a $\left(\log |V|\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ factor on graphs with bounded integrality gap for the vertex packing problem including trees and graphs with bounded degree. Moreover, we show that for several special families of graphs, we can get rid of the $\left(\log |V|\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$ factor and establish optimal regret.

**Abstract:** Photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT) shows great potentials in various preclinical and clinical applications. A great number of measurements are the premise that obtains a high-quality image, which implies a low imaging rate or a high system cost. The artifacts or sidelobes could pollute the image if we decrease the number of measured channels or limit the detected view. In this paper, a novel compressed sensing method for PACT using an untrained neural network is proposed, which decreases half number of the measured channels and recoveries enough details. This method uses a neural network to reconstruct without the requirement for any additional learning based on the deep image prior. The model can reconstruct the image only using a few detections with gradient descent. Our method can cooperate with other existing regularization, and further improve the quality. In addition, we introduce a shape prior to easily converge the model to the image. We verify the feasibility of untrained network based compressed sensing in PA image reconstruction, and compare this method with a conventional method using total variation minimization. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms 32.72% (SSIM) with the traditional compressed sensing method in the same regularization. It could dramatically reduce the requirement for the number of transducers, by sparsely sampling the raw PA data, and improve the quality of PA image significantly.

**Abstract:** Orienting objects is a critical component in the automation of many packing and assembly tasks. We present an algorithm to orient novel objects given a depth image of the object in its current and desired orientation. We formulate a self-supervised objective for this problem and train a deep neural network to estimate the 3D rotation as parameterized by a quaternion, between these current and desired depth images. We then use the trained network in a proportional controller to re-orient objects based on the estimated rotation between the two depth images. Results suggest that in simulation we can rotate unseen objects with unknown geometries by up to 30Â° with a median angle error of 1.47Â° over 100 random initial/desired orientations each for 22 novel objects. Experiments on physical objects suggest that the controller can achieve a median angle error of 4.2Â° over 10 random initial/desired orientations each for 5 objects.

**Abstract:** Graphon is a nonparametric model that generates graphs with arbitrary sizes and can be induced from graphs easily. Based on this model, we propose a novel algorithmic framework called \textit{graphon autoencoder} to build an interpretable and scalable graph generative model. This framework treats observed graphs as induced graphons in functional space and derives their latent representations by an encoder that aggregates Chebshev graphon filters. A linear graphon factorization model works as a decoder, leveraging the latent representations to reconstruct the induced graphons (and the corresponding observed graphs). We develop an efficient learning algorithm to learn the encoder and the decoder, minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the model and data distributions. This algorithm takes the KL divergence of the graph distributions conditioned on different graphons as the underlying distance and leads to a reward-augmented maximum likelihood estimation. The graphon autoencoder provides a new paradigm to represent and generate graphs, which has good generalizability and transferability.

**Abstract:** Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to improve model robustness against adversarial examples. However, previous works mainly focus on the overall robustness of the model, and the in-depth analysis on the role of each class involved in adversarial training is still missing. In this paper, we propose to analyze the class-wise robustness in adversarial training. First, we provide a detailed diagnosis of adversarial training on six benchmark datasets, i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet. Surprisingly, we find that there are remarkable robustness discrepancies among classes, leading to unbalance/unfair class-wise robustness in the robust models. Furthermore, we keep investigating the relations between classes and find that the unbalanced class-wise robustness is pretty consistent among different attack and defense methods. Moreover, we observe that the stronger attack methods in adversarial learning achieve performance improvement mainly from a more successful attack on the vulnerable classes (i.e., classes with less robustness). Inspired by these interesting findings, we design a simple but effective attack method based on the traditional PGD attack, named Temperature-PGD attack, which proposes to enlarge the robustness disparity among classes with a temperature factor on the confidence distribution of each image. Experiments demonstrate our method can achieve a higher attack rate than the PGD attack. Furthermore, from the defense perspective, we also make some modifications in the training and inference phase to improve the robustness of the most vulnerable class, so as to mitigate the large difference in class-wise robustness. We believe our work can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of adversarial training as well as rethinking the class-wise properties in robust models.

**Abstract:** The identification of protein-ligand interaction plays a key role in biochemical research and drug discovery. Although deep learning has recently shown great promise in discovering new drugs, there remains a gap between deep learning-based and experimental approaches. Here we propose a novel framework, named AIMEE, integrating AI Model and Enzymology Experiments, to identify inhibitors against 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2, which has taken a significant toll on people across the globe. From a bioactive chemical library, we have conducted two rounds of experiments and identified six novel inhibitors with a hit rate of 29.41%, and four of them showed an IC50 value less than 3 Î¼M. Moreover, we explored the interpretability of the central model in AIMEE, mapping the deep learning extracted features to domain knowledge of chemical properties. Based on this knowledge, a commercially available compound was selected and proven to be an activity-based probe of 3CLpro. This work highlights the great potential of combining deep learning models and biochemical experiments for intelligent iteration and expanding the boundaries of drug discovery.

**Abstract:** With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-empowered communications, industry, academia, and standardization organizations are progressing on the definition of mechanisms and procedures to address the increasing complexity of future 5G and beyond communications. In this context, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) organized the first AI for 5G Challenge to bring industry and academia together to introduce and solve representative problems related to the application of Machine Learning (ML) to networks. In this paper, we present the results gathered from Problem Statement~13 (PS-013), organized by Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), which primary goal was predicting the performance of next-generation Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) applying Channel Bonding (CB) techniques. In particular, we overview the ML models proposed by participants (including Artificial Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Random Forest regression, and gradient boosting) and analyze their performance on an open dataset generated using the IEEE 802.11ax-oriented Komondor network simulator. The accuracy achieved by the proposed methods demonstrates the suitability of ML for predicting the performance of WLANs. Moreover, we discuss the importance of abstracting WLAN interactions to achieve better results, and we argue that there is certainly room for improvement in throughput prediction through ML.

**Abstract:** In this survey, we systematically summarize the current literature on studies that apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the motion planning and control of autonomous vehicles. Many existing contributions can be attributed to the pipeline approach, which consists of many hand-crafted modules, each with a functionality selected for the ease of human interpretation. However, this approach does not automatically guarantee maximal performance due to the lack of a system-level optimization. Therefore, this paper also presents a growing trend of work that falls into the end-to-end approach, which typically offers better performance and smaller system scales. However, their performance also suffers from the lack of expert data and generalization issues. Finally, the remaining challenges applying deep RL algorithms on autonomous driving are summarized, and future research directions are also presented to tackle these challenges.

**Abstract:** Today's large-scale algorithms have become immensely influential, as they recommend and moderate the content that billions of humans are exposed to on a daily basis. They are the de-facto regulators of our societies' information diet, from shaping opinions on public health to organizing groups for social movements. This creates serious concerns, but also great opportunities to promote quality information. Addressing the concerns and seizing the opportunities is a challenging, enormous and fabulous endeavor, as intuitively appealing ideas often come with unwanted {\it side effects}, and as it requires us to think about what we deeply prefer.
  Understanding how today's large-scale algorithms are built is critical to determine what interventions will be most effective. Given that these algorithms rely heavily on {\it machine learning}, we make the following key observation: \emph{any algorithm trained on uncontrolled data must not be trusted}. Indeed, a malicious entity could take control over the data, poison it with dangerously manipulative fabricated inputs, and thereby make the trained algorithm extremely unsafe. We thus argue that the first step towards safe and ethical large-scale algorithms must be the collection of a large, secure and trustworthy dataset of reliable human judgments.
  To achieve this, we introduce \emph{Tournesol}, an open source platform available at \url{https://tournesol.app}. Tournesol aims to collect a large database of human judgments on what algorithms ought to widely recommend (and what they ought to stop widely recommending). We outline the structure of the Tournesol database, the key features of the Tournesol platform and the main hurdles that must be overcome to make it a successful project. Most importantly, we argue that, if successful, Tournesol may then serve as the essential foundation for any safe and ethical large-scale algorithm.

**Abstract:** We consider the sequential decision optimization on the periodic environment, that occurs in a wide variety of real-world applications when the data involves seasonality, such as the daily demand of drivers in ride-sharing and dynamic traffic patterns in transportation. In this work, we focus on learning the stochastic periodic world by leveraging this seasonal law. To deal with the general action space, we use the bandit based on Gaussian process (GP) as the base model due to its flexibility and generality, and propose the Periodic-GP method with a temporal periodic kernel based on the upper confidence bound. Theoretically, we provide a new regret bound of the proposed method, by explicitly characterizing the periodic kernel in the periodic stationary model. Empirically, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing methods in both synthetic data experiments and a real data application on Madrid traffic pollution.

**Abstract:** The internet of things devices suffer of low memory while good accuracy is needed. Designing suitable algorithms is vital in this subject. This paper proposes a feed forward LogNNet neural network which uses a semi-linear Henon type discrete chaotic map to classify MNIST-10 dataset. The model is composed of reservoir part and trainable classifier. The aim of reservoir part is transforming the inputs to maximize the classification accuracy using a special matrix filing method and a time series generated by the chaotic map. The parameters of the chaotic map are optimized using particle swarm optimization with random immigrants. The results show that the proposed LogNNet/Henon classifier has higher accuracy and same RAM saving comparable to the original version of LogNNet and has broad prospects for implementation in IoT devices. In addition, the relation between the entropy and accuracy of the classification is investigated. It is shown that there exists a direct relation between the value of entropy and accuracy of the classification.

**Abstract:** As the roadside perception plays an increasingly significant role in the Connected Automated Vehicle Highway(CAVH) technologies, there are immediate needs of challenging real-world roadside datasets for bench marking and training various computer vision tasks such as 2D/3D object detection and multi-sensor fusion. In this paper, we firstly introduce a challenging BAAI-VANJEE roadside dataset which consist of LiDAR data and RGB images collected by VANJEE smart base station placed on the roadside about 4.5m high. This dataset contains 2500 frames of LiDAR data, 5000 frames of RGB images, including 20% collected at the same time. It also contains 12 classes of objects, 74K 3D object annotations and 105K 2D object annotations. By providing a real complex urban intersections and highway scenes, we expect the BAAI-VANJEE roadside dataset will actively assist the academic and industrial circles to accelerate the innovation research and achievement transformation in the field of intelligent transportation in big data era.

**Abstract:** We investigate the predictive performance of two novel CNN-DNN machine learning ensemble models in predicting county-level corn yields across the US Corn Belt (12 states). The developed data set is a combination of management, environment, and historical corn yields from 1980-2019. Two scenarios for ensemble creation are considered: homogenous and heterogeneous ensembles. In homogenous ensembles, the base CNN-DNN models are all the same, but they are generated with a bagging procedure to ensure they exhibit a certain level of diversity. Heterogenous ensembles are created from different base CNN-DNN models which share the same architecture but have different levels of depth. Three types of ensemble creation methods were used to create several ensembles for either of the scenarios: Basic Ensemble Method (BEM), Generalized Ensemble Method (GEM), and stacked generalized ensembles. Results indicated that both designed ensemble types (heterogenous and homogenous) outperform the ensembles created from five individual ML models (linear regression, LASSO, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM). Furthermore, by introducing improvements over the heterogeneous ensembles, the homogenous ensembles provide the most accurate yield predictions across US Corn Belt states. This model could make 2019 yield predictions with a root mean square error of 866 kg/ha, equivalent to 8.5% relative root mean square, and could successfully explain about 77% of the spatio-temporal variation in the corn grain yields. The significant predictive power of this model can be leveraged for designing a reliable tool for corn yield prediction which will, in turn, assist agronomic decision-makers.

**Abstract:** Sluice resolution is a problem where a system needs to output the corresponding antecedents of wh-ellipses. The antecedents are elided contents behind the wh-words but are implicitly referred to using contexts. Previous work frames sluice resolution as question answering where this setting outperforms all its preceding works by large margins. Ellipsis and questions are referentially dependent expressions (anaphoras) and retrieving the corresponding antecedents are like answering questions to output pieces of clarifying information. However, the task is not fully solved. Therefore, we want to further investigate what makes sluice resolution differ to question answering and fill in the error gaps. We also present some results using recent state-of-the-art question answering systems which improve the previous work (86.01 to 90.39 F1).

**Abstract:** Corona virus or COVID-19 is a pandemic illness, which has influenced more than million of causalities worldwide and infected a few large number of individuals .Innovative instrument empowering quick screening of the COVID-19 contamination with high precision can be critically useful to the medical care experts. The primary clinical device presently being used for the analysis of COVID-19 is the Reverse record polymerase chain response as known as RT-PCR, which is costly, less-delicate and requires specific clinical work force. X-Ray imaging is an effectively available apparatus that can be a great option in the COVID-19 conclusion. This exploration was taken to examine the utility of computerized reasoning in the quick and exact recognition of COVID-19 from chest X-Ray pictures. The point of this paper is to propose a procedure for programmed recognition of COVID-19 from advanced chest X-Ray images applying pre-prepared profound learning calculations while boosting the discovery exactness. The point is to give over-focused on clinical experts a second pair of eyes through a learning picture characterization models. We distinguish an appropriate Convolutional Neural Network-CNN model through beginning similar investigation of a few mainstream CNN models.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present results of processing Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) recordings of visual patterns with a retinal model based on foveal-pit inspired Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filters. A DVS sensor was stimulated with varying number of vertical white and black bars of different spatial frequencies moving horizontally at a constant velocity. The output spikes generated by the DVS sensor were applied as input to a set of DoG filters inspired by the receptive field structure of the primate visual pathway. In particular, these filters mimic the receptive fields of the midget and parasol ganglion cells (spiking neurons of the retina) that sub-serve the photo-receptors of the foveal-pit. The features extracted with the foveal-pit model are used for further classification using a spiking convolutional neural network trained with a backpropagation variant adapted for spiking neural networks.

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the transfer learning problem under high-dimensional generalized linear models (GLMs), which aim to improve the fit on target data by borrowing information from useful source data. Given which sources to transfer, we propose an oracle algorithm and derive its $\ell_2$-estimation error bounds. The theoretical analysis shows that under certain conditions, when the target and source are sufficiently close to each other, the estimation error bound could be improved over that of the classical penalized estimator using only target data. When we don't know which sources to transfer, an algorithm-free transferable source detection approach is introduced to detect informative sources. The detection consistency is proved under the high-dimensional GLM transfer learning setting. Extensive simulations and a real-data experiment verify the effectiveness of our algorithms.

**Abstract:** We have presented a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) that incorporates retinal foveal-pit inspired Difference of Gaussian filters and rank-order encoding. The model is trained using a variant of the backpropagation algorithm adapted to work with spiking neurons, as implemented in the Nengo library. We have evaluated the performance of our model on two publicly available datasets - one for digit recognition task, and the other for vehicle recognition task. The network has achieved up to 90% accuracy, where loss is calculated using the cross-entropy function. This is an improvement over around 57% accuracy obtained with the alternate approach of performing the classification without any kind of neural filtering. Overall, our proof-of-concept study indicates that introducing biologically plausible filtering in existing SCNN architecture will work well with noisy input images such as those in our vehicle recognition task. Based on our results, we plan to enhance our SCNN by integrating lateral inhibition-based redundancy reduction prior to rank-ordering, which will further improve the classification accuracy by the network.

**Abstract:** Estimating health benefits of reducing fossil fuel use from improved air quality provides important rationales for carbon emissions abatement. Simulating pollution concentration is a crucial step of the estimation, but traditional approaches often rely on complicated chemical transport models that require extensive expertise and computational resources. In this study, we develop a novel and succinct machine learning framework that is able to provide precise and robust annual average fine particle (PM2.5) concentration estimations directly from a high-resolution fossil energy use data set. The accessibility and applicability of this framework show great potentials of machine learning approaches for integrated assessment studies. Applications of the framework with Chinese data reveal highly heterogeneous health benefits of reducing fossil fuel use in different sectors and regions in China with a mean of \$34/tCO2 and a standard deviation of \$84/tCO2. Reducing rural and residential coal use offers the highest co-benefits with a mean of \$360/tCO2. Our findings prompt careful policy designs to maximize cost-effectiveness in the transition towards a carbon-neutral energy system.

**Abstract:** Neural network (NN) training and generalization in the infinite-width limit are well-characterized by kernel methods with a neural tangent kernel (NTK) that is stationary in time. However, finite-width NNs consistently outperform corresponding kernel methods, suggesting the importance of feature learning, which manifests as the time evolution of NTKs. Here, we analyze the phenomenon of kernel alignment of the NTK with the target functions during gradient descent. We first provide a mechanistic explanation for why alignment between task and kernel occurs in deep linear networks. We then show that this behavior occurs more generally if one optimizes the feature map over time to accelerate learning while constraining how quickly the features evolve. Empirically, gradient descent undergoes a feature learning phase, during which top eigenfunctions of the NTK quickly align with the target function and the loss decreases faster than power law in time; it then enters a kernel gradient descent (KGD) phase where the alignment does not improve significantly and the training loss decreases in power law. We show that feature evolution is faster and more dramatic in deeper networks. We also found that networks with multiple output nodes develop separate, specialized kernels for each output channel, a phenomenon we termed kernel specialization. We show that this class-specific alignment is does not occur in linear networks.

**Abstract:** Epileptic seizures are a type of neurological disorder that affect many people worldwide. Specialist physicians and neurologists take advantage of structural and functional neuroimaging modalities to diagnose various types of epileptic seizures. Neuroimaging modalities assist specialist physicians considerably in analyzing brain tissue and the changes made in it. One method to accelerate the accurate and fast diagnosis of epileptic seizures is to employ computer aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) and functional and structural neuroimaging modalities. AI encompasses a variety of areas, and one of its branches is deep learning (DL). Not long ago, and before the rise of DL algorithms, feature extraction was an essential part of every conventional machine learning method, yet handcrafting features limit these models' performances to the knowledge of system designers. DL methods resolved this issue entirely by automating the feature extraction and classification process; applications of these methods in many fields of medicine, such as the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, have made notable improvements. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of the types of DL methods exploited to diagnose epileptic seizures from various neuroimaging modalities has been studied. Additionally, rehabilitation systems and cloud computing in epileptic seizures diagnosis applications have been exactly investigated using various modalities.

**Abstract:** Stochastic sparse linear bandits offer a practical model for high-dimensional online decision-making problems and have a rich information-regret structure. In this work we explore the use of information-directed sampling (IDS), which naturally balances the information-regret trade-off. We develop a class of information-theoretic Bayesian regret bounds that nearly match existing lower bounds on a variety of problem instances, demonstrating the adaptivity of IDS. To efficiently implement sparse IDS, we propose an empirical Bayesian approach for sparse posterior sampling using a spike-and-slab Gaussian-Laplace prior. Numerical results demonstrate significant regret reductions by sparse IDS relative to several baselines.

**Abstract:** We propose an end-to-end trainable framework that processes large-scale visual data tensors by looking at a fraction of their entries only. Our method combines a neural network encoder with a tensor train decomposition to learn a low-rank latent encoding, coupled with cross-approximation (CA) to learn the representation through a subset of the original samples. CA is an adaptive sampling algorithm that is native to tensor decompositions and avoids working with the full high-resolution data explicitly. Instead, it actively selects local representative samples that we fetch out-of-core and on-demand. The required number of samples grows only logarithmically with the size of the input. Our implicit representation of the tensor in the network enables processing large grids that could not be otherwise tractable in their uncompressed form. The proposed approach is particularly useful for large-scale multidimensional grid data (e.g., 3D tomography), and for tasks that require context over a large receptive field (e.g., predicting the medical condition of entire organs). The code is available at https://github.com/aelphy/c-pic.

**Abstract:** The growing popularity of wearable sensors has generated large quantities of temporal physiological and activity data. Ability to analyze this data offers new opportunities for real-time health monitoring and forecasting. However, temporal physiological data presents many analytic challenges: the data is noisy, contains many missing values, and each series has a different length. Most methods proposed for time series analysis and classification do not handle datasets with these characteristics nor do they offer interpretability and explainability, a critical requirement in the health domain. We propose an unsupervised method for learning representations of time series based on common patterns identified within them. The patterns are, interpretable, variable in length, and extracted using Byte Pair Encoding compression technique. In this way the method can capture both long-term and short-term dependencies present in the data. We show that this method applies to both univariate and multivariate time series and beats state-of-the-art approaches on a real world dataset collected from wearable sensors.

**Abstract:** This is the second paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation (RTE). In our previous work \cite{huang2021gradient}, we proposed an approach to directly learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional $P_N$ closure. However, the ML moment closure model in \cite{huang2021gradient} is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and long time stability. We propose in this paper a method to enforce the global hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. The main idea is to seek a symmetrizer (a symmetric positive definite matrix) for the closure system, and derive constraints such that the system is globally symmetrizable hyperbolic. It is shown that the new ML closure system inherits the dissipativeness of the RTE and preserves the correct diffusion limit as the Knunsden number goes to zero. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, long time stability and generalizability of our globally hyperbolic ML closure model.

Our specialized autoencoder infers a low dimensional manifold embedding for the rs-fMRI correlation matrices that mimics a canonical outer-product decomposition. The embedding is simultaneously used to reconstruct DTI tractography matrices via a second manifold alignment decoder and to predict inter-subject phenotypic variability via an artificial neural network. We validate our framework on a dataset of 275 healthy individuals from the Human Connectome Project database and on a second clinical dataset consisting of 57 subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorder. We demonstrate that the model reliably recovers structural connectivity patterns across individuals, while robustly extracting predictive and interpretable brain biomarkers in a cross-validated setting. Finally, our framework outperforms several baselines at predicting behavioral phenotypes in both real-world datasets.

**Abstract:** Mirror descent (MD) is a powerful first-order optimization technique that subsumes several optimization algorithms including gradient descent (GD). In this work, we study the exact convergence rate of MD in both centralized and distributed cases for strongly convex and smooth problems. We view MD with a dynamical system lens and leverage quadratic constraints (QCs) to provide convergence guarantees based on the Lyapunov stability. For centralized MD, we establish a semi-definite programming (SDP) that certifies exponentially fast convergence of MD subject to a linear matrix inequality (LMI). We prove that the SDP always has a feasible solution that recovers the optimal GD rate. Next, we analyze the exponential convergence of distributed MD and characterize the rate using two LMIs. To the best of our knowledge, the exact (exponential) rate of distributed MD has not been previously explored in the literature. We present numerical results as a verification of our theory and observe that the richness of the Lyapunov function entails better (worst-case) convergence rates compared to existing works on distributed GD.

**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation of breast cancer metastases in histopathological slides is a challenging task. In fact, significant variation in data characteristics of histopathology images (domain shift) make generalization of deep learning to unseen data difficult. Our goal is to address this challenge by using a conditional Fully Convolutional Network (co-FCN) whose output can be conditioned at run time, and which can improve its performance when a properly selected set of reference slides are used to condition the output. We adapted to our task a co-FCN originally applied to organs segmentation in volumetric medical images and we trained it on the Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from three out of five medical centers present in the CAMELYON17 dataset. We tested the performance of the network on the WSIs of the remaining centers. We also developed an automated selection strategy for selecting the conditioning subset, based on an unsupervised clustering process applied to a target-specific set of reference patches, followed by a selection policy that relies on the cluster similarities with the input patch. We benchmarked our proposed method against a U-Net trained on the same dataset with no conditioning. The conditioned network shows better performance that the U-Net on the WSIs with Isolated Tumor Cells and micro-metastases from the medical centers used as test. Our contributions are an architecture which can be applied to the histopathology domain and an automated procedure for the selection of conditioning data.

**Abstract:** Score-based methods represented as stochastic differential equations on a continuous time domain have recently proven successful as a non-adversarial generative model. Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score-matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score-matching objective and thus encodes information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code which achieves improvements of state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. As a side contribution, we show how adversarial training in score-based models can improve sample quality and improve sampling speed using a new approximation of the prior at smaller noise scales.

**Abstract:** Current out-of-distribution detection approaches usually present special requirements (e.g., collecting outlier data and hyperparameter validation) and produce side effects (e.g., classification accuracy drop and slow/inefficient inferences). Recently, entropic out-of-distribution detection has been proposed as a seamless approach (i.e., a solution that avoids all previously mentioned drawbacks). The entropic out-of-distribution detection solution uses the IsoMax loss for training and the entropic score for out-of-distribution detection. The IsoMax loss works as a drop-in replacement of the SoftMax loss (i.e., the combination of the output linear layer, the SoftMax activation, and the cross-entropy loss) because swapping the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax loss requires no changes in the model's architecture or training procedures/hyperparameters. In this paper, we perform what we call an isometrization of the distances used in the IsoMax loss. Additionally, we propose replacing the entropic score with the minimum distance score. Experiments showed that these modifications significantly increase out-of-distribution detection performance while keeping the solution seamless. Besides being competitive with or outperforming all major current approaches, the proposed solution avoids all their current limitations in addition to being much easier to use because only a simple loss replacement for training the neural network is required. The code to replace the SoftMax loss with the IsoMax+ loss and reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/dlmacedo/entropic-out-of-distribution-detection.

**Abstract:** To characterize the "average" of a sample of graphs, one can compute the sample Frechet mean (or median) graph, which provides an interpretable summary of the graph sample. In this paper, we address the following foundational question: does the mean or median graph inherit the structural properties of the graphs in the sample? An important graph property is the edge density. Because sparse graphs provide prototypical models for real networks, one would like to guarantee that the edge density be preserved when computing the sample mean (or median). In this paper, we prove that the edge density is an hereditary property, which can be transmitted from a graph sample to its sample Frechet mean (or median), irrespective of the method used to estimate the mean or the median. Specifically, we prove the following result: the number of edges of the Frechet mean (or median) graph of a set of graphs is bounded by the maximal number of edges amongst all the graphs in the sample. We prove the result for the graph Hamming distance, and the spectral adjacency pseudometric, using very different arguments.

**Abstract:** Conditional density estimation (CDE) is the task of estimating the probability of an event conditioned on some inputs. A neural network (NN) can be used to compute the output distribution for continuous-domain, but it is difficult to explicitly approximate a free-form one without knowing the information of its general form a priori. In order to fit an arbitrary conditional distribution, discretizing the continuous domain into bins is an effective strategy, as long as we have sufficiently narrow bins and very large data. However, collecting enough data is often hard to reach and falls far short of that ideal in many circumstances, especially in multivariate CDE for the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling free-form conditional distributions using a deconvolution-based neural net framework, coping with data deficiency problems in discretization. It has the advantage of being flexible but also takes advantage of the hierarchical smoothness offered by the deconvolution layers. We compare our method to a number of other density-estimation approaches and show that our Deconvolutional Density Network (DDN) outperforms the competing methods on many univariate and multivariate tasks.

**Abstract:** Entropic regularization provides a generalization of the original optimal transport problem. It introduces a penalty term defined by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, making the problem more tractable via the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm. Replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence with a general $f$-divergence leads to a natural generalization. Using convex analysis, we extend the theory developed so far to include $f$-divergences defined by functions of Legendre type, and prove that under some mild conditions, strong duality holds, optimums in both the primal and dual problems are attained, the generalization of the $c$-transform is well-defined, and we give sufficient conditions for the generalized Sinkhorn algorithm to converge to an optimal solution. We propose a practical algorithm for computing the regularized optimal transport cost and its gradient via the generalized Sinkhorn algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results on synthetic 2-dimensional data, demonstrating the effects of using different $f$-divergences for regularization, which influences convergence speed, numerical stability and sparsity of the optimal coupling.
