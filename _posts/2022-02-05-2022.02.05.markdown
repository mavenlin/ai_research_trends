**Abstract:** We propose a method for training ordinary differential equations by using a control-theoretic Lyapunov condition for stability. Our approach, called LyaNet, is based on a novel Lyapunov loss formulation that encourages the inference dynamics to converge quickly to the correct prediction. Theoretically, we show that minimizing Lyapunov loss guarantees exponential convergence to the correct solution and enables a novel robustness guarantee. We also provide practical algorithms, including one that avoids the cost of backpropagating through a solver or using the adjoint method. Relative to standard Neural ODE training, we empirically find that LyaNet can offer improved prediction performance, faster convergence of inference dynamics, and improved adversarial robustness.

**Abstract:** The prediction of quantum mechanical properties is historically plagued by a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Machine learning potentials have previously shown great success in this domain, reaching increasingly better accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency comparable with classical force fields. In this work we propose TorchMD-NET, a novel equivariant transformer (ET) architecture, outperforming state-of-the-art on MD17, ANI-1, and many QM9 targets in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Through an extensive attention weight analysis, we gain valuable insights into the black box predictor and show differences in the learned representation of conformers versus conformations sampled from molecular dynamics or normal modes. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of datasets including off-equilibrium conformations for the evaluation of molecular potentials.

**Abstract:** Learning from unlabeled or partially labeled data to alleviate human labeling remains a challenging research topic in 3D modeling. Along this line, unsupervised representation learning is a promising direction to auto-extract features without human intervention. This paper proposes a general unsupervised approach, named \textbf{ConClu}, to perform the learning of point-wise and global features by jointly leveraging point-level clustering and instance-level contrasting. Specifically, for one thing, we design an Expectation-Maximization (EM) like soft clustering algorithm that provides local supervision to extract discriminating local features based on optimal transport. We show that this criterion extends standard cross-entropy minimization to an optimal transport problem, which we solve efficiently using a fast variant of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. For another, we provide an instance-level contrasting method to learn the global geometry, which is formulated by maximizing the similarity between two augmentations of one point cloud. Experimental evaluations on downstream applications such as 3D object classification and semantic segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and show that it can outperform state-of-the-art techniques.

**Abstract:** The success of deep neural networks in image classification and learning can be partly attributed to the features they extract from images. It is often speculated about the properties of a low-dimensional manifold that models extract and learn from images. However, there is not sufficient understanding about this low-dimensional space based on theory or empirical evidence. For image classification models, their last hidden layer is the one where images of each class is separated from other classes and it also has the least number of features. Here, we develop methods and formulations to study that feature space for any model. We study the partitioning of the domain in feature space, identify regions guaranteed to have certain classifications, and investigate its implications for the pixel space. We observe that geometric arrangements of decision boundaries in feature space is significantly different compared to pixel space, providing insights about adversarial vulnerabilities, image morphing, extrapolation, ambiguity in classification, and the mathematical understanding of image classification models.

**Abstract:** Recent research has shown the existence of significant redundancy in large Transformer models. One can prune the redundant parameters without significantly sacrificing the generalization performance. However, we question whether the redundant parameters could have contributed more if they were properly trained. To answer this question, we propose a novel training strategy that encourages all parameters to be trained sufficiently. Specifically, we adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter according to its sensitivity, a robust gradient-based measure reflecting this parameter's contribution to the model performance. A parameter with low sensitivity is redundant, and we improve its fitting by increasing its learning rate. In contrast, a parameter with high sensitivity is well-trained, and we regularize it by decreasing its learning rate to prevent further overfitting. We conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding, neural machine translation, and image classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schedule. Analysis shows that the proposed schedule indeed reduces the redundancy and improves generalization performance.

**Abstract:** Human pose estimation in two-dimensional images videos has been a hot topic in the computer vision problem recently due to its vast benefits and potential applications for improving human life, such as behaviors recognition, motion capture and augmented reality, training robots, and movement tracking. Many state-of-the-art methods implemented with Deep Learning have addressed several challenges and brought tremendous remarkable results in the field of human pose estimation. Approaches are classified into two kinds: the two-step framework (top-down approach) and the part-based framework (bottom-up approach). While the two-step framework first incorporates a person detector and then estimates the pose within each box independently, detecting all body parts in the image and associating parts belonging to distinct persons is conducted in the part-based framework. This paper aims to provide newcomers with an extensive review of deep learning methods-based 2D images for recognizing the pose of people, which only focuses on top-down approaches since 2016. The discussion through this paper presents significant detectors and estimators depending on mathematical background, the challenges and limitations, benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and comparison between methods.

**Abstract:** Internet of Things devices are expanding rapidly and generating huge amount of data. There is an increasing need to explore data collected from these devices. Collaborative learning provides a strategic solution for the Internet of Things settings but also raises public concern over data privacy. In recent years, large amount of privacy preserving techniques have been developed based on differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. A major challenge of collaborative learning is to balance disclosure risk and data utility while maintaining high computation efficiency. In this paper, we proposed privacy preserving logistic regression model using matrix encryption approach. The secure scheme achieves local differential privacy and can be implemented for both vertical and horizontal partitioning scenarios. Moreover, cross validation is investigated to generate robust model results without increasing the communication cost. Simulation illustrates the high efficiency of proposed scheme to analyze dataset with millions of records. Experimental evaluations further demonstrate high model accuracy while achieving privacy protection.

**Abstract:** Random pruning is arguably the most naive way to attain sparsity in neural networks, but has been deemed uncompetitive by either post-training pruning or sparse training. In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight a perhaps counter-intuitive finding, that random pruning at initialization can be quite powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without any delicate pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, we empirically demonstrate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network from scratch can match the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two key factors that contribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as the original dense networks grow wider and deeper, the performance of training a randomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its dense equivalent, even at high sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsity ratios can be pre-chosen for sparse training, which shows to be another important performance booster. Simple as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetwork of Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperforming a dense Wide ResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also observed such randomly pruned networks outperform dense counterparts in other favorable aspects, such as out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and adversarial robustness. Overall, our results strongly suggest there is larger-than-expected room for sparse training at scale, and the benefits of sparsity might be more universal beyond carefully designed pruning.

**Abstract:** We address the problem of learning a machine learning model from training data that originates at multiple data owners while providing formal privacy guarantees regarding the protection of each owner's data. Existing solutions based on Differential Privacy (DP) achieve this at the cost of a drop in accuracy. Solutions based on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) do not incur such accuracy loss but leak information when the trained model is made publicly available. We propose an MPC solution for training DP models. Our solution relies on an MPC protocol for model training, and an MPC protocol for perturbing the trained model coefficients with Laplace noise in a privacy-preserving manner. The resulting MPC+DP approach achieves higher accuracy than a pure DP approach while providing the same formal privacy guarantees. Our work obtained first place in the iDASH2021 Track III competition on confidential computing for secure genome analysis.

**Abstract:** Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) refers to the recognition of human emotions from natural speech. If done accurately, it can offer a number of benefits in building human-centered context-aware intelligent systems. Existing SER approaches are largely centralized, without considering users' privacy. Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm dealing with decentralization of privacy-sensitive personal data. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving and data-efficient SER approach by utilizing the concept of FL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated SER approach, which utilizes self-training learning in conjunction with federated learning to exploit both labeled and unlabeled on-device data. Our experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP dataset shows that our federated approach can learn generalizable SER models even under low availability of data labels and highly non-i.i.d. distributions. We show that our approach with as few as 10% labeled data, on average, can improve the recognition rate by 8.67% compared to the fully-supervised federated counterparts.

**Abstract:** Nowadays, fast delivery services have created the need for high-density warehouses. The puzzle-based storage system is a practical way to enhance the storage density, however, facing difficulties in the retrieval process. In this work, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, specifically the Double&Dueling Deep Q Network, is developed to solve the multi-item retrieval problem in the system with general settings, where multiple desired items, escorts, and I/O points are placed randomly. Additionally, we propose a general compact integer programming model to evaluate the solution quality. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the reinforcement learning approach can yield high-quality solutions and outperforms three related state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms. Furthermore, a conversion algorithm and a decomposition framework are proposed to handle simultaneous movement and large-scale instances respectively, thus improving the applicability of the PBS system.

**Abstract:** Predicting vulnerable source code helps to focus attention on those parts of the code that need to be examined with more scrutiny. Recent work proposed the use of function names as semantic cues that can be learned by a deep neural network (DNN) to aid in the hunt for vulnerability of functions.
  Combining identifier splitting, which splits each function name into its constituent words, with a novel frequency-based algorithm, we explore the extent to which the words that make up a function's name can predict potentially vulnerable functions. In contrast to *lightweight* predictions by a DNN that considers only function names, avoiding the use of a DNN provides *featherweight* predictions. The underlying idea is that function names that contain certain "dangerous" words are more likely to accompany vulnerable functions. Of course, this assumes that the frequency-based algorithm can be properly tuned to focus on truly dangerous words.
  Because it is more transparent than a DNN, the frequency-based algorithm enables us to investigate the inner workings of the DNN. If successful, this investigation into what the DNN does and does not learn will help us train more effective future models.
  We empirically evaluate our approach on a heterogeneous dataset containing over 73000 functions labeled vulnerable, and over 950000 functions labeled benign. Our analysis shows that words alone account for a significant portion of the DNN's classification ability. We also find that words are of greatest value in the datasets with a more homogeneous vocabulary. Thus, when working within the scope of a given project, where the vocabulary is unavoidably homogeneous, our approach provides a cheaper, potentially complementary, technique to aid in the hunt for source-code vulnerabilities. Finally, this approach has the advantage that it is viable with orders of magnitude less training data.

<p>

**Abstract:** We study the problem of finding fair and efficient allocations of a set of indivisible items to a set of agents, where each item may be a good (positively valued) for some agents and a bad (negatively valued) for others, i.e., a mixed manna. As fairness notions, we consider arguably the strongest possible relaxations of envy-freeness and proportionality, namely envy-free up to any item (EFX and EFX$_0$), and proportional up to the maximin good or any bad (PropMX and PropMX$_0$). Our efficiency notion is Pareto-optimality (PO).
  We study two types of instances:
  (i) Separable, where the item set can be partitioned into goods and bads, and (ii) Restricted mixed goods (RMG), where for each item $j$, every agent has either a non-positive value for $j$, or values $j$ at the same $v_j>0$. We obtain polynomial-time algorithms for the following:
  (i) Separable instances: PropMX$_0$ allocation.
  (ii) RMG instances: Let pure bads be the set of items that everyone values negatively.
  - PropMX allocation for general pure bads.
  - EFX+PropMX allocation for identically-ordered pure bads.
  - EFX+PropMX+PO allocation for identical pure bads.
  Finally, if the RMG instances are further restricted to binary mixed goods where all the $v_j$'s are the same, we strengthen the results to guarantee EFX$_0$ and PropMX$_0$ respectively.

**Abstract:** Annotating objects with 3D bounding boxes in LiDAR pointclouds is a costly human driven process in an autonomous driving perception system. In this paper, we present a method to semi-automatically annotate real-world pointclouds collected by deployment vehicles using simulated data. We train a 3D object detector model on labeled simulated data from CARLA jointly with real world pointclouds from our target vehicle. The supervised object detection loss is augmented with a CORAL loss term to reduce the distance between labeled simulated and unlabeled real pointcloud feature representations. The goal here is to learn representations that are invariant to simulated (labeled) and real-world (unlabeled) target domains. We also provide an updated survey on domain adaptation methods for pointclouds.

**Abstract:** Autonomous driving (AD) datasets have progressively grown in size in the past few years to enable better deep representation learning. Active learning (AL) has re-gained attention recently to address reduction of annotation costs and dataset size. AL has remained relatively unexplored for AD datasets, especially on point cloud data from LiDARs. This paper performs a principled evaluation of AL based dataset distillation on (1/4th) of the large Semantic-KITTI dataset. Further on, the gains in model performance due to data augmentation (DA) are demonstrated across different subsets of the AL loop. We also demonstrate how DA improves the selection of informative samples to annotate. We observe that data augmentation achieves full dataset accuracy using only 60\% of samples from the selected dataset configuration. This provides faster training time and subsequent gains in annotation costs.

**Abstract:** This paper formally models the strategic repeated interactions between a system, comprising of a machine learning (ML) model and associated explanation method, and an end-user who is seeking a prediction/label and its explanation for a query/input, by means of game theory. In this game, a malicious end-user must strategically decide when to stop querying and attempt to compromise the system, while the system must strategically decide how much information (in the form of noisy explanations) it should share with the end-user and when to stop sharing, all without knowing the type (honest/malicious) of the end-user. This paper formally models this trade-off using a continuous-time stochastic Signaling game framework and characterizes the Markov perfect equilibrium state within such a framework.

**Abstract:** As robotic systems become more and more capable of assisting humans in their everyday lives, we must consider the opportunities for these artificial agents to make their human collaborators feel unsafe or to treat them unfairly. Robots can exhibit antisocial behavior causing physical harm to people or reproduce unfair behavior replicating and even amplifying historical and societal biases which are detrimental to humans they interact with. In this paper, we discuss these issues considering sociable robotic manipulation and fair robotic decision making. We propose a novel approach to learning fair and sociable behavior, not by reproducing positive behavior, but rather by avoiding negative behavior. In this study, we highlight the importance of incorporating sociability in robot manipulation, as well as the need to consider fairness in human-robot interactions.

**Abstract:** Renovating the memories in old photos is an intriguing research topic in computer vision fields. These legacy images often suffer from severe and commingled degradations such as cracks, noise, and color-fading, while lack of large-scale paired old photo datasets makes this restoration task very challenging. In this work, we present a novel reference-based end-to-end learning framework that can jointly repair and colorize the degraded legacy pictures. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three modules: a restoration sub-network for degradation restoration, a similarity sub-network for color histogram matching and transfer, and a colorization subnet that learns to predict the chroma elements of the images conditioned on chromatic reference signals. The whole system takes advantage of the color histogram priors in a given reference image, which vastly reduces the dependency on large-scale training data. Apart from the proposed method, we also create, to our knowledge, the first public and real-world old photo dataset with paired ground truth for evaluating old photo restoration models, wherein each old photo is paired with a manually restored pristine image by PhotoShop experts. Our extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts both quantitatively and qualitatively.

<p>

**Abstract:** Many deep neural networks are susceptible to minute perturbations of images that have been carefully crafted to cause misclassification. Ideally, a robust classifier would be immune to small variations in input images, and a number of defensive approaches have been created as a result. One method would be to discern a latent representation which could ignore small changes to the input. However, typical autoencoders easily mingle inter-class latent representations when there are strong similarities between classes, making it harder for a decoder to accurately project the image back to the original high-dimensional space. We propose a novel framework, Memory Defense, an augmented classifier with a memory-masking autoencoder to counter this challenge. By masking other classes, the autoencoder learns class-specific independent latent representations. We test the model's robustness against four widely used attacks. Experiments on the Fashion-MNIST & CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model. We make available our source code at GitHub repository: https://github.com/eashanadhikarla/MemDefense

**Abstract:** Cybersecurity is now at the forefront of most organisational digital transformative agendas and National economic, social and political programmes. Hence its impact to society can no longer be seen to be one dimensional. The rise in National cybersecurity laws and regulations is a good indicator of its perceived importance to nations. And the recent awakening for social and ethical transparency in society and coupled with sustainability issues demonstrate the need for a paradigm shift in how cybersecurity discourses can now happen. In response to this shift, a multidimensional cybersecurity framework for strategic foresight underpinned on situational awareness is proposed. The conceptual cybersecurity framework comprising six domains such as Physical, Cultural, Economic, Social, Political and Cyber, is discussed. The guiding principles underpinning the framework are outlined, followed by in-depth reflection on the Business, Operational, Technological and Human (BOTH) factors and their implications for strategic foresight for cybersecurity.

**Abstract:** Facing the challenge of statistical diversity in client local data distribution, personalized federated learning (PFL) has become a growing research hotspot. Although the state-of-the-art methods with model similarity-based pairwise collaboration have achieved promising performance, they neglect the fact that model aggregation is essentially a collaboration process within the coalition, where the complex multiwise influences take place among clients. In this paper, we first apply Shapley value (SV) from coalition game theory into the PFL scenario. To measure the multiwise collaboration among a group of clients on the personalized learning performance, SV takes their marginal contribution to the final result as a metric. We propose a novel personalized algorithm: pFedSV, which can 1. identify each client's optimal collaborator coalition and 2. perform personalized model aggregation based on SV. Extensive experiments on various datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10) are conducted with different Non-IID data settings (Pathological and Dirichlet). The results show that pFedSV can achieve superior personalized accuracy for each client, compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

**Abstract:** The presence of sarcasm in conversational systems and social media like chatbots, Facebook, Twitter, etc. poses several challenges for downstream NLP tasks. This is attributed to the fact that the intended meaning of a sarcastic text is contrary to what is expressed. Further, the use of code-mix language to express sarcasm is increasing day by day. Current NLP techniques for code-mix data have limited success due to the use of different lexicon, syntax, and scarcity of labeled corpora. To solve the joint problem of code-mixing and sarcasm detection, we propose the idea of capturing incongruity through sub-word level embeddings learned via fastText. Empirical results shows that our proposed model achieves F1-score on code-mix Hinglish dataset comparable to pretrained multilingual models while training 10x faster and using a lower memory footprint

**Abstract:** Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a value-network that predicts the full distribution of the returns for a given state, often modeled via a quantile-based critic. This approach has been successfully integrated into common RL methods for continuous control, giving rise to algorithms such as Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC). In this paper, we introduce multi-sample target values (MTV) for distributional RL, as a principled replacement for single-sample target value estimation, as commonly employed in current practice. The improved distributional estimates further lend themselves to UCB-based exploration. These two ideas are combined to yield our distributional RL algorithm, E2DC (Extra Exploration with Distributional Critics). We evaluate our approach on a range of continuous control tasks and demonstrate state-of-the-art model-free performance on difficult tasks such as Humanoid control. We provide further insight into the method via visualization and analysis of the learned distributions and their evolution during training.

**Abstract:** Signal measurements appearing in the form of time series are one of the most common types of data used in medical machine learning applications. However, such datasets are often small, making the training of deep neural network architectures ineffective. For time-series, the suite of data augmentation tricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model long sequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle these problems, we introduce TTS-GAN, a transformer-based GAN which can successfully generate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length, similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of the GAN model are built using a pure transformer encoder architecture. We use visualizations and dimensionality reduction techniques to demonstrate the similarity of real and generated time-series data. We also compare the quality of our generated data with the best existing alternative, which is an RNN-based time-series GAN.

**Abstract:** Reservoir simulations are computationally expensive in the well control and well placement optimization. Generally, numerous simulation runs (realizations) are needed in order to achieve the optimal well locations. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) framework to build a surrogate feed-forward model which replaces simulation runs to accelerate the optimization process. Our GNN framework includes an encoder, a process, and a decoder which takes input from the processed graph data designed and generated from the simulation raw data. We train the GNN model with 6000 samples (equivalent to 40 well configurations) with each containing the previous step state variable and the next step state variable. We test the GNN model with another 6000 samples and after model tuning, both one-step prediction and rollout prediction achieve a close match with the simulation results. Our GNN framework shows great potential in the application of well-related subsurface optimization including oil and gas as well as carbon capture sequestration (CCS).

**Abstract:** The problem of determining if a military unit has correctly understood an order and is properly executing on it is one that has bedeviled military planners throughout history. The advent of advanced language models such as OpenAI's GPT-series offers new possibilities for addressing this problem. This paper presents a mechanism to harness the narrative output of large language models and produce diagrams or "maps" of the relationships that are latent in the weights of such models as the GPT-3. The resulting "Neural Narrative Maps" (NNMs), are intended to provide insight into the organization of information, opinion, and belief in the model, which in turn provide means to understand intent and response in the context of physical distance. This paper discusses the problem of mapping information spaces in general, and then presents a concrete implementation of this concept in the context of OpenAI's GPT-3 language model for determining if a subordinate is following a commander's intent in a high-risk situation. The subordinate's locations within the NNM allow a novel capability to evaluate the intent of the subordinate with respect to the commander. We show that is is possible not only to determine if they are nearby in narrative space, but also how they are oriented, and what "trajectory" they are on. Our results show that our method is able to produce high-quality maps, and demonstrate new ways of evaluating intent more generally.

**Abstract:** Data poisoning attacks aim at manipulating model behaviors through distorting training data. Previously, an aggregation-based certified defense, Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA), was proposed to mitigate this threat. DPA predicts through an aggregation of base classifiers trained on disjoint subsets of data, thus restricting its sensitivity to dataset distortions. In this work, we propose an improved certified defense against general poisoning attacks, namely Finite Aggregation. In contrast to DPA, which directly splits the training set into disjoint subsets, our method first splits the training set into smaller disjoint subsets and then combines duplicates of them to build larger (but not disjoint) subsets for training base classifiers. This reduces the worst-case impacts of poison samples and thus improves certified robustness bounds. In addition, we offer an alternative view of our method, bridging the designs of deterministic and stochastic aggregation-based certified defenses. Empirically, our proposed Finite Aggregation consistently improves certificates on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB, boosting certified fractions by up to 3.05%, 3.87% and 4.77%, respectively, while keeping the same clean accuracies as DPA's, effectively establishing a new state of the art in (pointwise) certified robustness against data poisoning.

**Abstract:** The current standard approach for fine-tuning transformer-based language models includes a fixed number of training epochs and a linear learning rate schedule. In order to obtain a near-optimal model for the given downstream task, a search in optimization hyperparameter space is usually required. In particular, the number of training epochs needs to be adjusted to the dataset size. In this paper, we introduce adaptive fine-tuning, which is an alternative approach that uses early stopping and a custom learning rate schedule to dynamically adjust the number of training epochs to the dataset size. For the example use case of named entity recognition, we show that our approach not only makes hyperparameter search with respect to the number of training epochs redundant, but also leads to improved results in terms of performance, stability and efficiency. This holds true especially for small datasets, where we outperform the state-of-the-art fine-tuning method by a large margin.

**Abstract:** Human intention is an internal, mental characterization for acquiring desired information. From interactive interfaces containing either textual or graphical information, intention to perceive desired information is subjective and strongly connected with eye gaze. In this work, we determine such intention by analyzing real-time eye gaze data with a low-cost regular webcam. We extracted unique features (e.g., Fixation Count, Eye Movement Ratio) from the eye gaze data of 31 participants to generate a dataset containing 124 samples of visual intention for perceiving textual or graphical information, labeled as either TEXT or IMAGE, having 48.39% and 51.61% distribution, respectively. Using this dataset, we analyzed 5 classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Accuracy: 92.19%). Using the trained SVM, we investigated the variation of visual intention among 30 participants, distributed in 3 age groups, and found out that young users were more leaned towards graphical contents whereas older adults felt more interested in textual ones. This finding suggests that real-time eye gaze data can be a potential source of identifying visual intention, analyzing which intention aware interactive interfaces can be designed and developed to facilitate human cognition.

<p>

**Abstract:** The challenge of communication-efficient distributed optimization has attracted attention in recent years. In this paper, a communication efficient algorithm, called ordering-based alternating direction method of multipliers (OADMM) is devised in a general fully decentralized network setting where a worker can only exchange messages with neighbors. Compared to the classical ADMM, a key feature of OADMM is that transmissions are ordered among workers at each iteration such that a worker with the most informative data broadcasts its local variable to neighbors first, and neighbors who have not transmitted yet can update their local variables based on that received transmission. In OADMM, we prohibit workers from transmitting if their current local variables are not sufficiently different from their previously transmitted value. A variant of OADMM, called SOADMM, is proposed where transmissions are ordered but transmissions are never stopped for each node at each iteration. Numerical results demonstrate that given a targeted accuracy, OADMM can significantly reduce the number of communications compared to existing algorithms including ADMM. We also show numerically that SOADMM can accelerate convergence, resulting in communication savings compared to the classical ADMM.

**Abstract:** We present a novel real-time visual odometry framework for a stereo setup of a depth and high-resolution event camera. Our framework balances accuracy and robustness against computational efficiency towards strong performance in challenging scenarios. We extend conventional edge-based semi-dense visual odometry towards time-surface maps obtained from event streams. Semi-dense depth maps are generated by warping the corresponding depth values of the extrinsically calibrated depth camera. The tracking module updates the camera pose through efficient, geometric semi-dense 3D-2D edge alignment. Our approach is validated on both public and self-collected datasets captured under various conditions. We show that the proposed method performs comparable to state-of-the-art RGB-D camera-based alternatives in regular conditions, and eventually outperforms in challenging conditions such as high dynamics or low illumination.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Network (GNN) is an emerging technique for graph-based learning tasks such as node classification. In this work, we reveal the vulnerability of GNN to the imbalance of node labels. Traditional solutions for imbalanced classification (e.g. resampling) are ineffective in node classification without considering the graph structure. Worse still, they may even bring overfitting or underfitting results due to lack of sufficient prior knowledge. To solve these problems, we propose a novel graph neural network framework with curriculum learning (GNN-CL) consisting of two modules. For one thing, we hope to acquire certain reliable interpolation nodes and edges through the novel graph-based oversampling based on smoothness and homophily. For another, we combine graph classification loss and metric learning loss which adjust the distance between different nodes associated with minority class in feature space. Inspired by curriculum learning, we dynamically adjust the weights of different modules during training process to achieve better ability of generalization and discrimination. The proposed framework is evaluated via several widely used graph datasets, showing that our proposed model consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Estimating and understanding the surroundings of the vehicle precisely forms the basic and crucial step for the autonomous vehicle. The perception system plays a significant role in providing an accurate interpretation of a vehicle's environment in real-time. Generally, the perception system involves various subsystems such as localization, obstacle (static and dynamic) detection, and avoidance, mapping systems, and others. For perceiving the environment, these vehicles will be equipped with various exteroceptive (both passive and active) sensors in particular cameras, Radars, LiDARs, and others. These systems are equipped with deep learning techniques that transform the huge amount of data from the sensors into semantic information on which the object detection and localization tasks are performed. For numerous driving tasks, to provide accurate results, the location and depth information of a particular object is necessary. 3D object detection methods, by utilizing the additional pose data from the sensors such as LiDARs, stereo cameras, provides information on the size and location of the object. Based on recent research, 3D object detection frameworks performing object detection and localization on LiDAR data and sensor fusion techniques show significant improvement in their performance. In this work, a comparative study of the effect of using LiDAR data for object detection frameworks and the performance improvement seen by using sensor fusion techniques are performed. Along with discussing various state-of-the-art methods in both the cases, performing experimental analysis, and providing future research directions.

In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial detector, which consists of a robust classifier and a plain one, to highly detect adversarial examples. The proposed adversarial detector is carried out in accordance with the logits of plain and robust classifiers. In an experiment, the proposed detector is demonstrated to outperform a state-of-the-art detector without any robust classifier.

**Abstract:** The convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most commonly used architectures for computer vision tasks. The key building block of a CNN is the convolutional kernel that aggregates information from the pixel neighborhood and shares weights across all pixels. A standard CNN's capacity, and thus its performance, is directly related to the number of learnable kernel weights, which is determined by the number of channels and the kernel size (support). In this paper, we present the \textit{hyper-convolution}, a novel building block that implicitly encodes the convolutional kernel using spatial coordinates. Hyper-convolutions decouple kernel size from the total number of learnable parameters, enabling a more flexible architecture design. We demonstrate in our experiments that replacing regular convolutions with hyper-convolutions can improve performance with less parameters, and increase robustness against noise. We provide our code here: \emph{https://github.com/tym002/Hyper-Convolution}

**Abstract:** To speed-up the solution to parametrized differential problems, reduced order models (ROMs) have been developed over the years, including projection-based ROMs such as the reduced-basis (RB) method, deep learning-based ROMs, as well as surrogate models obtained via a machine learning approach. Thanks to its physics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of the full order model (FOM) onto a linear low-dimensional subspace, RB methods yield approximations that fulfill the physical problem at hand. However, to make the assembling of a ROM independent of the FOM dimension, intrusive and expensive hyper-reduction stages are usually required, such as the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), thus making this strategy less feasible for problems characterized by (high-order polynomial or nonpolynomial) nonlinearities. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel strategy for learning nonlinear ROM operators using deep neural networks (DNNs). The resulting hyper-reduced order model enhanced by deep neural networks, to which we refer to as Deep-HyROMnet, is then a physics-based model, still relying on the RB method approach, however employing a DNN architecture to approximate reduced residual vectors and Jacobian matrices once a Galerkin projection has been performed. Numerical results dealing with fast simulations in nonlinear structural mechanics show that Deep-HyROMnets are orders of magnitude faster than POD-Galerkin-DEIM ROMs, keeping the same level of accuracy.

**Abstract:** As we collect additional samples from a data population for which a known density function estimate may have been previously obtained by a black box method, the increased complexity of the data set may result in the true density being deviated from the known estimate by a mixture distribution. To model this phenomenon, we consider the \emph{deviating mixture model} $(1-Œª^{*})h_0 + Œª^{*} (\sum_{i = 1}^{k} p_{i}^{*} f(x|Œ∏_{i}^{*}))$, where $h_0$ is a known density function, while the deviated proportion $Œª^{*}$ and latent mixing measure $G_{*} = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} p_{i}^{*} Œ¥_{Œ∏_i^{*}}$ associated with the mixture distribution are unknown. Via a novel notion of distinguishability between the known density $h_{0}$ and the deviated mixture distribution, we establish rates of convergence for the maximum likelihood estimates of $Œª^{*}$ and $G^{*}$ under Wasserstein metric. Simulation studies are carried out to illustrate the theory.

**Abstract:** Understanding the asymptotic behavior of gradient-descent training of deep neural networks is essential for revealing inductive biases and improving network performance. We derive the infinite-time training limit of a mathematically tractable class of deep nonlinear neural networks, gated linear networks (GLNs), and generalize these results to gated networks described by general homogeneous polynomials. We study the implications of our results, focusing first on two-layer GLNs. We then apply our theoretical predictions to GLNs trained on MNIST and show how architectural constraints and the implicit bias of gradient descent affect performance. Finally, we show that our theory captures a substantial portion of the inductive bias of ReLU networks. By making the inductive bias explicit, our framework is poised to inform the development of more efficient, biologically plausible, and robust learning algorithms.

**Abstract:** Modern machine learning techniques commonly rely on complex, high-dimensional embedding representations to capture underlying structure in the data and improve performance. In order to characterize model flaws and choose a desirable representation, model builders often need to compare across multiple embedding spaces, a challenging analytical task supported by few existing tools. We first interviewed nine embedding experts in a variety of fields to characterize the diverse challenges they face and techniques they use when analyzing embedding spaces. Informed by these perspectives, we developed a novel system called Emblaze that integrates embedding space comparison within a computational notebook environment. Emblaze uses an animated, interactive scatter plot with a novel Star Trail augmentation to enable visual comparison. It also employs novel neighborhood analysis and clustering procedures to dynamically suggest groups of points with interesting changes between spaces. Through a series of case studies with ML experts, we demonstrate how interactive comparison with Emblaze can help gain new insights into embedding space structure.

**Abstract:** Data visualization is a critical component in terms of interacting with floating-point output data from large model simulation codes. Indeed, postprocessing analysis workflows on simulation data often generate a large number of images from the raw data, many of which are then compared to each other or to specified reference images. In this image-comparison scenario, image quality assessment (IQA) measures are quite useful, and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) continues to be a popular choice. However, generating large numbers of images can be costly, and plot-specific (but data independent) choices can affect the SSIM value. A natural question is whether we can apply the SSIM directly to the floating-point simulation data and obtain an indication of whether differences in the data are likely to impact a visual assessment, effectively bypassing the creation of a specific set of images from the data. To this end, we propose an alternative to the popular SSIM that can be applied directly to the floating point data, which we refer to as the Data SSIM (DSSIM). While we demonstrate the usefulness of the DSSIM in the context of evaluating differences due to lossy compression on large volumes of simulation data from a popular climate model, the DSSIM may prove useful for many other applications involving simulation or image data.

**Abstract:** Traditional recommendation models trained on observational interaction data have generated large impacts in a wide range of applications, it faces bias problems that cover users' true intent and thus deteriorate the recommendation effectiveness. Existing methods tracks this problem as eliminating bias for the robust recommendation, e.g., by re-weighting training samples or learning disentangled representation. The disentangled representation methods as the state-of-the-art eliminate bias through revealing cause-effect of the bias generation. However, how to design the semantics-aware and unbiased representation for users true intents is largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, we are the first to propose an unbiased and semantics-aware disentanglement learning called CaDSI (Causal Disentanglement for Semantics-Aware Intent Learning) from a causal perspective. Particularly, CaDSI explicitly models the causal relations underlying recommendation task, and thus produces semantics-aware representations via disentangling users true intents aware of specific item context. Moreover, the causal intervention mechanism is designed to eliminate confounding bias stemmed from context information, which further to align the semantics-aware representation with users true intent. Extensive experiments and case studies both validate the robustness and interpretability of our proposed model.

**Abstract:** Although shape correspondence is a central problem in geometry processing, most methods for this task apply only to two-dimensional surfaces. The neglected task of volumetric correspondence--a natural extension relevant to shapes extracted from simulation, medical imaging, volume rendering, and even improving surface maps of boundary representations--presents unique challenges that do not appear in the two-dimensional case. In this work, we propose a method for mapping between volumes represented as tetrahedral meshes. Our formulation minimizes a distortion energy designed to extract maps symmetrically, i.e., without dependence on the ordering of the source and target domains. We accompany our method with theoretical discussion describing the consequences of this symmetry assumption, leading us to select a symmetrized ARAP energy that favors isometric correspondences. Our final formulation optimizes for near-isometry while matching the boundary. We demonstrate our method on a diverse geometric dataset, producing low-distortion matchings that align to the boundary.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as machine learning algorithms, have allowed scientists, marketers and governments to shed light on correlations that remained invisible until now. Beforehand, the dots that we had to connect in order to imagine a new knowledge were either too numerous, too sparse or not even detected. Sometimes, the information was not stored in the same data lake or format and was not able to communicate. But in creating new bridges with AI, many problems appeared such as bias reproduction, unfair inferences or mass surveillance. Our aim is to show that, on one hand, the AI's deep ethical problem lays essentially in these new connections made possible by systems interoperability. In connecting the spheres of our life, these systems undermine the notion of justice particular to each of them, because the new interactions create dominances of social goods from a sphere to another. These systems make therefore spheres permeable to one another and, in doing so, they open to progress as well as to tyranny. On another hand, however, we would like to emphasize that the act to connect what used to seem a priori disjoint is a necessary move of knowledge and scientific progress.

**Abstract:** With the continuous extension of the Industrial Internet, cyber incidents caused by software vulnerabilities have been increasing in recent years. However, software vulnerabilities detection is still heavily relying on code review done by experts, and how to automatedly detect software vulnerabilities is an open problem so far. In this paper, we propose a novel solution named GraphEye to identify whether a function of C/C++ code has vulnerabilities, which can greatly alleviate the burden of code auditors. GraphEye is originated from the observation that the code property graph of a non-vulnerable function naturally differs from the code property graph of a vulnerable function with the same functionality. Hence, detecting vulnerable functions is attributed to the graph classification problem.GraphEye is comprised of VecCPG and GcGAT. VecCPG is a vectorization for the code property graph, which is proposed to characterize the key syntax and semantic features of the corresponding source code. GcGAT is a deep learning model based on the graph attention graph, which is proposed to solve the graph classification problem according to VecCPG. Finally, GraphEye is verified by the SARD Stack-based Buffer Overflow, Divide-Zero, Null Pointer Deference, Buffer Error, and Resource Error datasets, the corresponding F1 scores are 95.6%, 95.6%,96.1%,92.6%, and 96.1% respectively, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
