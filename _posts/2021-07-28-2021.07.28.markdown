**Abstract:** We consider control from the perspective of competitive analysis. Unlike much prior work on learning-based control, which focuses on minimizing regret against the best controller selected in hindsight from some specific class, we focus on designing an online controller which competes against a clairvoyant offline optimal controller. A natural performance metric in this setting is competitive ratio, which is the ratio between the cost incurred by the online controller and the cost incurred by the offline optimal controller. Using operator-theoretic techniques from robust control, we derive a computationally efficient state-space description of the the controller with optimal competitive ratio in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings. We extend competitive control to nonlinear systems using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and present numerical experiments which show that our competitive controller can significantly outperform standard $H_2$ and $H_{\infty}$ controllers in the MPC setting.

**Abstract:** The expanding adoption of digital pathology has enabled the curation of large repositories of histology whole slide images (WSIs), which contain a wealth of information. Similar pathology image search offers the opportunity to comb through large historical repositories of gigapixel WSIs to identify cases with similar morphological features and can be particularly useful for diagnosing rare diseases, identifying similar cases for predicting prognosis, treatment outcomes, and potential clinical trial success. A critical challenge in developing a WSI search and retrieval system is scalability, which is uniquely challenging given the need to search a growing number of slides that each can consist of billions of pixels and are several gigabytes in size. Such systems are typically slow and retrieval speed often scales with the size of the repository they search through, making their clinical adoption tedious and are not feasible for repositories that are constantly growing. Here we present Fast Image Search for Histopathology (FISH), a histology image search pipeline that is infinitely scalable and achieves constant search speed that is independent of the image database size while being interpretable and without requiring detailed annotations. FISH uses self-supervised deep learning to encode meaningful representations from WSIs and a Van Emde Boas tree for fast search, followed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm to retrieve similar WSIs. We evaluated FISH on multiple tasks and datasets with over 22,000 patient cases spanning 56 disease subtypes. We additionally demonstrate that FISH can be used to assist with the diagnosis of rare cancer types where sufficient cases may not be available to train traditional supervised deep models. FISH is available as an easy-to-use, open-source software package (https://github.com/mahmoodlab/FISH).

**Abstract:** This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub "prompt-based learning". Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.

**Abstract:** Collaborative filtering models based on matrix factorization and learned similarities using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained significant attention in recent years. This is, in part, because ANNs have demonstrated good results in a wide variety of recommendation tasks. The introduction of ANNs within the recommendation ecosystem has been recently questioned, raising several comparisons in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. One aspect most of these comparisons have in common is their focus on accuracy, neglecting other evaluation dimensions important for the recommendation, such as novelty, diversity, or accounting for biases. We replicate experiments from three papers that compare Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Matrix Factorization (MF), to extend the analysis to other evaluation dimensions. Our contribution shows that the experiments are entirely reproducible, and we extend the study including other accuracy metrics and two statistical hypothesis tests. We investigated the Diversity and Novelty of the recommendations, showing that MF provides a better accuracy also on the long tail, although NCF provides a better item coverage and more diversified recommendations. We discuss the bias effect generated by the tested methods. They show a relatively small bias, but other recommendation baselines, with competitive accuracy performance, consistently show to be less affected by this issue. This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, where several evaluation dimensions have been explored for an array of SOTA algorithms covering recent adaptations of ANNs and MF. Hence, we show the potential these techniques may have on beyond-accuracy evaluation while analyzing the effect on reproducibility these complementary dimensions may spark.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a Simple and effective unsupervised adaptation method for Robust Object Detection (SimROD). To overcome the challenging issues of domain shift and pseudo-label noise, our method integrates a novel domain-centric augmentation method, a gradual self-labeling adaptation procedure, and a teacher-guided fine-tuning mechanism. Using our method, target domain samples can be leveraged to adapt object detection models without changing the model architecture or generating synthetic data. When applied to image corruptions and high-level cross-domain adaptation benchmarks, our method outperforms prior baselines on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks. SimROD achieves new state-of-the-art on standard real-to-synthetic and cross-camera setup benchmarks. On the image corruption benchmark, models adapted with our method achieved a relative robustness improvement of 15-25% AP50 on Pascal-C and 5-6% AP on COCO-C and Cityscapes-C. On the cross-domain benchmark, our method outperformed the best baseline performance by up to 8% AP50 on Comic dataset and up to 4% on Watercolor dataset.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success in natural language processing. Most of PLMs follow the default setting of architecture hyper-parameters (e.g., the hidden dimension is a quarter of the intermediate dimension in feed-forward sub-networks) in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Few studies have been conducted to explore the design of architecture hyper-parameters in BERT, especially for the more efficient PLMs with tiny sizes, which are essential for practical deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we adopt the one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically search architecture hyper-parameters. Specifically, we carefully design the techniques of one-shot learning and the search space to provide an adaptive and efficient development way of tiny PLMs for various latency constraints. We name our method AutoTinyBERT and evaluate its effectiveness on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. The extensive experiments show that our method outperforms both the SOTA search-based baseline (NAS-BERT) and the SOTA distillation-based methods (such as DistilBERT, TinyBERT, MiniLM and MobileBERT). In addition, based on the obtained architectures, we propose a more efficient development method that is even faster than the development of a single PLM.

**Abstract:** Explainability of AI systems is critical for users to take informed actions and hold systems accountable. While "opening the opaque box" is important, understanding who opens the box can govern if the Human-AI interaction is effective. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-methods study of how two different groups of whos--people with and without a background in AI--perceive different types of AI explanations. These groups were chosen to look at how disparities in AI backgrounds can exacerbate the creator-consumer gap. We quantitatively share what the perceptions are along five dimensions: confidence, intelligence, understandability, second chance, and friendliness. Qualitatively, we highlight how the AI background influences each group's interpretations and elucidate why the differences might exist through the lenses of appropriation and cognitive heuristics. We find that (1) both groups had unwarranted faith in numbers, to different extents and for different reasons, (2) each group found explanatory values in different explanations that went beyond the usage we designed them for, and (3) each group had different requirements of what counts as humanlike explanations. Using our findings, we discuss potential negative consequences such as harmful manipulation of user trust and propose design interventions to mitigate them. By bringing conscious awareness to how and why AI backgrounds shape perceptions of potential creators and consumers in XAI, our work takes a formative step in advancing a pluralistic Human-centered Explainable AI discourse.

**Abstract:** Symbolic knowledge can provide crucial inductive bias for training neural models, especially in low data regimes. A successful strategy for incorporating such knowledge involves relaxing logical statements into sub-differentiable losses for optimization. In this paper, we study the question of how best to relax logical expressions that represent labeled examples and knowledge about a problem; we focus on sub-differentiable t-norm relaxations of logic. We present theoretical and empirical criteria for characterizing which relaxation would perform best in various scenarios. In our theoretical study driven by the goal of preserving tautologies, the Lukasiewicz t-norm performs best. However, in our empirical analysis on the text chunking and digit recognition tasks, the product t-norm achieves best predictive performance. We analyze this apparent discrepancy, and conclude with a list of best practices for defining loss functions via logic.

**Abstract:** Respiratory rate (RR) is a clinical metric used to assess overall health and physical fitness. An individual's RR can change from their baseline due to chronic illness symptoms (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure), acute illness (e.g., breathlessness due to infection), and over the course of the day due to physical exhaustion during heightened exertion. Remote estimation of RR can offer a cost-effective method to track disease progression and cardio-respiratory fitness over time. This work investigates a model-driven approach to estimate RR from short audio segments obtained after physical exertion in healthy adults. Data was collected from 21 individuals using microphone-enabled, near-field headphones before, during, and after strenuous exercise. RR was manually annotated by counting perceived inhalations and exhalations. A multi-task Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with convolutional layers was implemented to process mel-filterbank energies, estimate RR in varying background noise conditions, and predict heavy breathing, indicated by an RR of more than 25 breaths per minute. The multi-task model performs both classification and regression tasks and leverages a mixture of loss functions. It was observed that RR can be estimated with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.76 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.2, demonstrating that audio can be a viable signal for approximating RR.

**Abstract:** After an autoencoder (AE) has learnt to reconstruct one dataset, it might be expected that the likelihood on an out-of-distribution (OOD) input would be low. This has been studied as an approach to detect OOD inputs. Recent work showed this intuitive approach can fail for the dataset pairs FashionMNIST vs MNIST. This paper suggests this is due to the use of Bernoulli likelihood and analyses why this is the case, proposing two fixes: 1) Compute the uncertainty of likelihood estimate by using a Bayesian version of the AE. 2) Use alternative distributions to model the likelihood.

**Abstract:** The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been widely adopted to alleviate the data scalability issue, while the existing works usually focus on classifying independently discrete labels. However, in many tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis), the labels are discrete and successively distributed. The UDA for ordinal classification requires inducing non-trivial ordinal distribution prior to the latent space. Target for this, the partially ordered set (poset) is defined for constraining the latent vector. Instead of the typically i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior, in this work, a recursively conditional Gaussian (RCG) set is adapted for ordered constraint modeling, which admits a tractable joint distribution prior. Furthermore, we are able to control the density of content vector that violates the poset constraints by a simple "three-sigma rule". We explicitly disentangle the cross-domain images into a shared ordinal prior induced ordinal content space and two separate source/target ordinal-unrelated spaces, and the self-training is worked on the shared space exclusively for ordinal-aware domain alignment. Extensive experiments on UDA medical diagnoses and facial age estimation demonstrate its effectiveness.

**Abstract:** When developing deep neural networks for segmenting intraoperative ultrasound images, several practical issues are encountered frequently, such as the presence of ultrasound frames that do not contain regions of interest and the high variance in ground-truth labels. In this study, we evaluate the utility of a pre-screening classification network prior to the segmentation network. Experimental results demonstrate that such a classifier, minimising frame classification errors, was able to directly impact the number of false positive and false negative frames. Importantly, the segmentation accuracy on the classifier-selected frames, that would be segmented, remains comparable to or better than those from standalone segmentation networks. Interestingly, the efficacy of the pre-screening classifier was affected by the sampling methods for training labels from multiple observers, a seemingly independent problem. We show experimentally that a previously proposed approach, combining random sampling and consensus labels, may need to be adapted to perform well in our application. Furthermore, this work aims to share practical experience in developing a machine learning application that assists highly variable interventional imaging for prostate cancer patients, to present robust and reproducible open-source implementations, and to report a set of comprehensive results and analysis comparing these practical, yet important, options in a real-world clinical application.

**Abstract:** Bike-sharing systems are a rapidly developing mode of transportation and provide an efficient alternative to passive, motorized personal mobility. The asymmetric nature of bike demand causes the need for rebalancing bike stations, which is typically done during night time. To determine the optimal starting inventory level of a station for a given day, a User Dissatisfaction Function (UDF) models user pickups and returns as non-homogeneous Poisson processes with piece-wise linear rates. In this paper, we devise a deep generative model directly applicable in the UDF by introducing a variational Poisson recurrent neural network model (VP-RNN) to forecast future pickup and return rates. We empirically evaluate our approach against both traditional and learning-based forecasting methods on real trip travel data from the city of New York, USA, and show how our model outperforms benchmarks in terms of system efficiency and demand satisfaction. By explicitly focusing on the combination of decision-making algorithms with learning-based forecasting methods, we highlight a number of shortcomings in literature. Crucially, we show how more accurate predictions do not necessarily translate into better inventory decisions. By providing insights into the interplay between forecasts, model assumptions, and decisions, we point out that forecasts and decision models should be carefully evaluated and harmonized to optimally control shared mobility systems.

**Abstract:** Semi-supervised approaches for crowd counting attract attention, as the fully supervised paradigm is expensive and laborious due to its request for a large number of images of dense crowd scenarios and their annotations. This paper proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student framework focuses on high confident regions' information while addressing the noisy supervision from the unlabeled data in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model's surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time. Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main task and the surrogate task in the student model, which helps the surrogate task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the student model. Experimental results on four challenging crowd counting datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.

**Abstract:** To improve the accessibility of smart devices and to simplify their usage, building models which understand user interfaces (UIs) and assist users to complete their tasks is critical. However, unique challenges are proposed by UI-specific characteristics, such as how to effectively leverage multimodal UI features that involve image, text, and structural metadata and how to achieve good performance when high-quality labeled data is unavailable. To address such challenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model trained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to learn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key intuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e., the image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We propose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different features of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We evaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert outperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.

**Abstract:** OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the richest openly available sources of volunteered geographic information. Although OSM includes various geographical entities, their descriptions are highly heterogeneous, incomplete, and do not follow any well-defined ontology. Knowledge graphs can potentially provide valuable semantic information to enrich OSM entities. However, interlinking OSM entities with knowledge graphs is inherently difficult due to the large, heterogeneous, ambiguous, and flat OSM schema and the annotation sparsity. This paper tackles the alignment of OSM tags with the corresponding knowledge graph classes holistically by jointly considering the schema and instance layers. We propose a novel neural architecture that capitalizes upon a shared latent space for tag-to-class alignment created using linked entities in OSM and knowledge graphs. Our experiments performed to align OSM datasets for several countries with two of the most prominent openly available knowledge graphs, namely, Wikidata and DBpedia, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art schema alignment baselines by up to 53 percentage points in terms of F1-score. The resulting alignment facilitates new semantic annotations for over 10 million OSM entities worldwide, which is more than a 400% increase compared to the existing semantic annotations in OSM.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes teeth-photo, a new biometric modality for human authentication on mobile and hand held devices. Biometrics samples are acquired using the camera mounted on mobile device with the help of a mobile application having specific markers to register the teeth area. Region of interest (RoI) is then extracted using the markers and the obtained sample is enhanced using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) for better visual clarity. We propose a deep learning architecture and novel regularization scheme to obtain highly discriminative embedding for small size RoI. Proposed custom loss function was able to achieve perfect classification for the tiny RoI of $75\times 75$ size. The model is end-to-end and few-shot and therefore is very efficient in terms of time and energy requirements. The system can be used in many ways including device unlocking and secure authentication. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work on teeth-photo based authentication for mobile device. Experiments have been conducted on an in-house teeth-photo database collected using our application. The database is made publicly available. Results have shown that the proposed system has perfect accuracy.

**Abstract:** Bounding the generalization error of a supervised learning algorithm is one of the most important problems in learning theory, and various approaches have been developed. However, existing bounds are often loose and lack of guarantees. As a result, they may fail to characterize the exact generalization ability of a learning algorithm. Our main contribution is an exact characterization of the expected generalization error of the well-known Gibbs algorithm in terms of symmetrized KL information between the input training samples and the output hypothesis. Such a result can be applied to tighten existing expected generalization error bound. Our analysis provides more insight on the fundamental role the symmetrized KL information plays in controlling the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose an adversarial unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approach with the inherent conditional and label shifts, in which we aim to align the distributions w.r.t. both $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$. Since the label is inaccessible in the target domain, the conventional adversarial UDA assumes $p(y)$ is invariant across domains, and relies on aligning $p(x)$ as an alternative to the $p(x|y)$ alignment. To address this, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of the conventional adversarial UDA methods under both conditional and label shifts, and propose a novel and practical alternative optimization scheme for adversarial UDA. Specifically, we infer the marginal $p(y)$ and align $p(x|y)$ iteratively in the training, and precisely align the posterior $p(y|x)$ in testing. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on both classification and segmentation UDA, and partial UDA.

**Abstract:** Radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation remains a major challenge in the search for radio technosignatures. Typical mitigation strategies include a direction-of-origin (DoO) filter, where a signal is classified as RFI if it is detected in multiple directions on the sky. These classifications generally rely on estimates of signal properties, such as frequency and frequency drift rate. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer a promising complement to existing filters because they can be trained to analyze dynamic spectra directly, instead of relying on inferred signal properties. In this work, we compiled several data sets consisting of labeled pairs of images of dynamic spectra, and we designed and trained a CNN that can determine whether or not a signal detected in one scan is also present in another scan. This CNN-based DoO filter outperforms both a baseline 2D correlation model as well as existing DoO filters over a range of metrics, with precision and recall values of 99.15% and 97.81%, respectively. We found that the CNN reduces the number of signals requiring visual inspection after the application of traditional DoO filters by a factor of 6-16 in nominal situations.

**Abstract:** Recent years have seen a surge in research on deep interpretable neural networks with decision trees as one of the most commonly incorporated tools. There are at least three advantages of using decision trees over logistic regression classification models: they are easy to interpret since they are based on binary decisions, they can make decisions faster, and they provide a hierarchy of classes. However, one of the well-known drawbacks of decision trees, as compared to decision graphs, is that decision trees cannot reuse the decision nodes. Nevertheless, decision graphs were not commonly used in deep learning due to the lack of efficient gradient-based training techniques. In this paper, we fill this gap and provide a general paradigm based on Markov processes, which allows for efficient training of the special type of decision graphs, which we call Self-Organizing Neural Graphs (SONG). We provide an extensive theoretical study of SONG, complemented by experiments conducted on Letter, Connect4, MNIST, CIFAR, and TinyImageNet datasets, showing that our method performs on par or better than existing decision models.

**Abstract:** Embeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data, to verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.

**Abstract:** In this demo, we present VirtualConductor, a system that can generate conducting video from any given music and a single user's image. First, a large-scale conductor motion dataset is collected and constructed. Then, we propose Audio Motion Correspondence Network (AMCNet) and adversarial-perceptual learning to learn the cross-modal relationship and generate diverse, plausible, music-synchronized motion. Finally, we combine 3D animation rendering and a pose transfer model to synthesize conducting video from a single given user's image. Therefore, any user can become a virtual conductor through the system.

**Abstract:** In recent years, with the advent of deep-learning, face recognition has achieved exceptional success. However, many of these deep face recognition models perform much better in handling frontal faces compared to profile faces. The major reason for poor performance in handling of profile faces is that it is inherently difficult to learn pose-invariant deep representations that are useful for profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the profile face domain possesses a latent connection with the frontal face domain in a latent feature subspace. We look to exploit this latent connection by projecting the profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent subspace and perform verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a coupled conditional generative adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find the hidden relationship between the profile and frontal images in a latent common embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists of two conditional GAN-based sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the other dedicated to the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a projection that maximizes the pair-wise correlation between the two feature domains in a common embedding feature subspace. The efficacy of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the CFP, CMU Multi-PIE, IJB-A, and IJB-C datasets. Additionally, we have also implemented a coupled convolutional neural network (cpCNN) and an adversarial discriminative domain adaptation network (ADDA) for profile to frontal face recognition. We have evaluated the performance of cpCNN and ADDA and compared it with the proposed cpGAN. Finally, we have also evaluated our cpGAN for reconstruction of frontal faces from input profile faces contained in the VGGFace2 dataset.

**Abstract:** Detecting abnormal activities in real-world surveillance videos is an important yet challenging task as the prior knowledge about video anomalies is usually limited or unavailable. Despite that many approaches have been developed to resolve this problem, few of them can capture the normal spatio-temporal patterns effectively and efficiently. Moreover, existing works seldom explicitly consider the local consistency at frame level and global coherence of temporal dynamics in video sequences. To this end, we propose Convolutional Transformer based Dual Discriminator Generative Adversarial Networks (CT-D2GAN) to perform unsupervised video anomaly detection. Specifically, we first present a convolutional transformer to perform future frame prediction. It contains three key components, i.e., a convolutional encoder to capture the spatial information of the input video clips, a temporal self-attention module to encode the temporal dynamics, and a convolutional decoder to integrate spatio-temporal features and predict the future frame. Next, a dual discriminator based adversarial training procedure, which jointly considers an image discriminator that can maintain the local consistency at frame-level and a video discriminator that can enforce the global coherence of temporal dynamics, is employed to enhance the future frame prediction. Finally, the prediction error is used to identify abnormal video frames. Thoroughly empirical studies on three public video anomaly detection datasets, i.e., UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and Shanghai Tech Campus, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial spatio-temporal modeling framework.

<p>

**Abstract:** In this work we study statistical properties of graph-based algorithms for multi-manifold clustering (MMC). In MMC the goal is to retrieve the multi-manifold structure underlying a given Euclidean data set when this one is assumed to be obtained by sampling a distribution on a union of manifolds $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}_1 \cup\dots \cup \mathcal{M}_N$ that may intersect with each other and that may have different dimensions. We investigate sufficient conditions that similarity graphs on data sets must satisfy in order for their corresponding graph Laplacians to capture the right geometric information to solve the MMC problem. Precisely, we provide high probability error bounds for the spectral approximation of a tensorized Laplacian on $\mathcal{M}$ with a suitable graph Laplacian built from the observations; the recovered tensorized Laplacian contains all geometric information of all the individual underlying manifolds. We provide an example of a family of similarity graphs, which we call annular proximity graphs with angle constraints, satisfying these sufficient conditions. We contrast our family of graphs with other constructions in the literature based on the alignment of tangent planes. Extensive numerical experiments expand the insights that our theory provides on the MMC problem.

**Abstract:** 3D time-of-flight (ToF) imaging is used in a variety of applications such as augmented reality (AR), computer interfaces, robotics and autonomous systems. Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are one of the enabling technologies providing accurate depth data even over long ranges. By developing SPADs in array format with integrated processing combined with pulsed, flood-type illumination, high-speed 3D capture is possible. However, array sizes tend to be relatively small, limiting the lateral resolution of the resulting depth maps, and, consequently, the information that can be extracted from the image for applications such as object detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome through the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high-performance object detection. We present outdoor results from a portable SPAD camera system that outputs 16-bin photon timing histograms with 64x32 spatial resolution. The results, obtained with exposure times down to 2 ms (equivalent to 500 FPS) and in signal-to-background (SBR) ratios as low as 0.05, point to the advantages of providing the CNN with full histogram data rather than point clouds alone. Alternatively, a combination of point cloud and active intensity data may be used as input, for a similar level of performance. In either case, the GPU-accelerated processing time is less than 1 ms per frame, leading to an overall latency (image acquisition plus processing) in the millisecond range, making the results relevant for safety-critical computer vision applications which would benefit from faster than human reaction times.

<p>

**Abstract:** Learning continuous control in high-dimensional sparse reward settings, such as robotic manipulation, is a challenging problem due to the number of samples often required to obtain accurate optimal value and policy estimates. While many deep reinforcement learning methods have aimed at improving sample efficiency through replay or improved exploration techniques, state of the art actor-critic and policy gradient methods still suffer from the hard exploration problem in sparse reward settings. Motivated by recent successes of value-based methods for approximating state-action values, like RBF-DQN, we explore the potential of value-based reinforcement learning for learning continuous robotic manipulation tasks in multi-task sparse reward settings. On robotic manipulation tasks, we empirically show RBF-DQN converges faster than current state of the art algorithms such as TD3, SAC, and PPO. We also perform ablation studies with RBF-DQN and have shown that some enhancement techniques for vanilla Deep Q learning such as Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) can also be applied to RBF-DQN. Our experimental analysis suggests that value-based approaches may be more sensitive to data augmentation and replay buffer sample techniques than policy-gradient methods, and that the benefits of these methods for robot manipulation are heavily dependent on the transition dynamics of generated subgoal states.

**Abstract:** Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal period mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential for the delayed disease progression and the improved quality of patients'life. The emerging computer-aided diagnostic methods that combine deep learning with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) have achieved encouraging results, but some of them are limit of issues such as data leakage and unexplainable diagnosis. In this research, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for automated diagnosis of AD and localization of important brain regions related to the disease from sMRI data. This approach is based on a 2D single model strategy and has the following differences from the current approaches: 1) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of different structures and capacities are evaluated systemically and the most suitable model is adopted for AD diagnosis; 2) a data augmentation strategy named Two-stage Random RandAugment (TRRA) is proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue caused by limited training data and to improve the classification performance in AD diagnosis; 3) an explainable method of Grad-CAM++ is introduced to generate the visually explainable heatmaps that localize and highlight the brain regions that our model focuses on and to make our model more transparent. Our approach has been evaluated on two publicly accessible datasets for two classification tasks of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable MCI (sMCI). The experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, including those using multi-model and 3D CNN methods. The resultant localization heatmaps from our approach also highlight the lateral ventricle and some disease-relevant regions of cortex, coincident with the commonly affected regions during the development of AD.

**Abstract:** Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has shown its strength for a lot of deterministic and stochastic examples, but literature lacks reports of applications to real world industrial processes. Common reasons for this are that there is no efficient simulator of the process available or there exist problems in applying MCTS to the complex rules of the process. In this paper, we apply MCTS for optimizing a high-precision manufacturing process that has stochastic and partially observable outcomes. We make use of an expert-knowledge-based simulator and adapt the MCTS default policy to deal with the manufacturing process.

**Abstract:** Federated analytics has many applications in edge computing, its use can lead to better decision making for service provision, product development, and user experience. We propose a Bayesian approach to trend detection in which the probability of a keyword being trendy, given a dataset, is computed via Bayes' Theorem; the probability of a dataset, given that a keyword is trendy, is computed through secure aggregation of such conditional probabilities over local datasets of users. We propose a protocol, named SAFE, for Bayesian federated analytics that offers sufficient privacy for production grade use cases and reduces the computational burden of users and an aggregator. We illustrate this approach with a trend detection experiment and discuss how this approach could be extended further to make it production-ready.

**Abstract:** In this paper we present a deep graph reinforcement learning model to predict and improve the user experience during a live video streaming event, orchestrated by an agent/tracker. We first formulate the user experience prediction problem as a classification task, accounting for the fact that most of the viewers at the beginning of an event have poor quality of experience due to low-bandwidth connections and limited interactions with the tracker. In our model we consider different factors that influence the quality of user experience and train the proposed model on diverse state-action transitions when viewers interact with the tracker. In addition, provided that past events have various user experience characteristics we follow a gradient boosting strategy to compute a global model that learns from different events. Our experiments with three real-world datasets of live video streaming events demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against several baseline strategies. Moreover, as the majority of the viewers at the beginning of an event has poor experience, we show that our model can significantly increase the number of viewers with high quality experience by at least 75% over the first streaming minutes. Our evaluation datasets and implementation are publicly available at https://publicresearch.z13.web.core.windows.net

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network for performing note-level instrument assignment. Given a polyphonic multi-instrumental music signal along with its ground truth or predicted notes, the objective is to assign an instrumental source for each note. This problem is addressed as a pitch-informed classification task where each note is analysed individually. We also propose to utilise several kernel shapes in the convolutional layers in order to facilitate learning of efficient timbre-discriminative feature maps. Experiments on the MusicNet dataset using 7 instrument classes show that our approach is able to achieve an average F-score of 0.904 when the original multi-pitch annotations are used as the pitch information for the system, and that it also excels if the note information is provided using third-party multi-pitch estimation algorithms. We also include ablation studies investigating the effects of the use of multiple kernel shapes and comparing different input representations for the audio and the note-related information.

**Abstract:** Accurate topology is key when performing meaningful anatomical segmentations, however, it is often overlooked in traditional deep learning methods. In this work we propose TEDS-Net: a novel segmentation method that guarantees accurate topology. Our method is built upon a continuous diffeomorphic framework, which enforces topology preservation. However, in practice, diffeomorphic fields are represented using a finite number of parameters and sampled using methods such as linear interpolation, violating the theoretical guarantees. We therefore introduce additional modifications to more strictly enforce it. Our network learns how to warp a binary prior, with the desired topological characteristics, to complete the segmentation task. We tested our method on myocardium segmentation from an open-source 2D heart dataset. TEDS-Net preserved topology in 100% of the cases, compared to 90% from the U-Net, without sacrificing on Hausdorff Distance or Dice performance.

<p>

**Abstract:** Countless research works of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the task of credit card fraud detection have focused on improving the accuracy of point predictions and mitigating unwanted biases by building different network architectures or learning models. Quantifying uncertainty accompanied by point estimation is essential because it mitigates model unfairness and permits practitioners to develop trustworthy systems which abstain from suboptimal decisions due to low confidence. Explicitly, assessing uncertainties associated with DNNs predictions is critical in real-world card fraud detection settings for characteristic reasons, including (a) fraudsters constantly change their strategies, and accordingly, DNNs encounter observations that are not generated by the same process as the training distribution, (b) owing to the time-consuming process, very few transactions are timely checked by professional experts to update DNNs. Therefore, this study proposes three uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques named Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble, and ensemble Monte Carlo dropout for card fraud detection applied on transaction data. Moreover, to evaluate the predictive uncertainty estimates, UQ confusion matrix and several performance metrics are utilized. Through experimental results, we show that the ensemble is more effective in capturing uncertainty corresponding to generated predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed UQ methods provide extra insight to the point predictions, leading to elevate the fraud prevention process.

**Abstract:** Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are platforms used for research and exploration of marine environments. However, these types of vehicles face many challenges that hinder their widespread use in the industry. One of the main limitations is obtaining accurate position estimation, due to the lack of GPS signal underwater. This estimation is usually done with Kalman filters. However, new developments in the neuroscience field have shed light on the mechanisms by which mammals are able to obtain a reliable estimation of their current position based on external and internal motion cues. A new type of neuron, called Grid cells, has been shown to be part of path integration system in the brain. In this article, we show how grid cells can be used for obtaining a position estimation of underwater vehicles. The model of grid cells used requires only the linear velocities together with heading orientation and provides a reliable estimation of the vehicle's position. We provide simulation results for an AUV which show the feasibility of our proposed methodology.

**Abstract:** In the field of autonomous driving and robotics, point clouds are showing their excellent real-time performance as raw data from most of the mainstream 3D sensors. Therefore, point cloud neural networks have become a popular research direction in recent years. So far, however, there has been little discussion about the explainability of deep neural networks for point clouds. In this paper, we propose a point cloud-applicable explainability approach based on local surrogate model-based method to show which components contribute to the classification. Moreover, we propose quantitative fidelity validations for generated explanations that enhance the persuasive power of explainability and compare the plausibility of different existing point cloud-applicable explainability methods. Our new explainability approach provides a fairly accurate, more semantically coherent and widely applicable explanation for point cloud classification tasks.

**Abstract:** The pixelwise reconstruction error of deep autoencoders is often utilized for image novelty detection and localization under the assumption that pixels with high error indicate which parts of the input image are unfamiliar and therefore likely to be novel. This assumed correlation between pixels with high reconstruction error and novel regions of input images has not been verified and may limit the accuracy of these methods. In this paper we utilize saliency maps to evaluate whether this correlation exists. Saliency maps reveal directly how much a change in each input pixel would affect reconstruction loss, while each pixel's reconstruction error may be attributed to many input pixels when layers are fully connected. We compare saliency maps to reconstruction error maps via qualitative visualizations as well as quantitative correspondence between the top K elements of the maps for both novel and normal images. Our results indicate that reconstruction error maps do not closely correlate with the importance of pixels in the input images, making them insufficient for novelty localization.

**Abstract:** Knowledge built culturally across generations allows humans to learn far more than an individual could glean from their own experience in a lifetime. Cultural knowledge in turn rests on language: language is the richest record of what previous generations believed, valued, and practiced, and how these evolved over time. The power and mechanisms of language as a means of cultural learning, however, are not well understood, and as a result, current AI systems do not leverage language as a means for cultural knowledge transmission. Here, we take a first step towards reverse-engineering cultural learning through language. We developed a suite of complex tasks in the form of minimalist-style video games, which we deployed in an iterated learning paradigm. Human participants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to beat each game and were allowed to write a message to a future participant who read the message before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across generations, allowing later generations to advance further in the games and perform more efficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a strikingly similar trajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited number of lives. Successive generations of learners were able to succeed by expressing distinct types of knowledge in natural language: the dynamics of the environment, valuable goals, dangerous risks, and strategies for success. The video game paradigm we pioneer here is thus a rich test bed for developing AI systems capable of acquiring and transmitting cultural knowledge.

**Abstract:** As the proportion of road accidents increases each year, driver distraction continues to be an important risk component in road traffic injuries and deaths. The distractions caused by the increasing use of mobile phones and other wireless devices pose a potential risk to road safety. Our current study aims to aid the already existing techniques in driver posture recognition by improving the performance in the driver distraction classification problem. We present an approach using a genetic algorithm-based ensemble of six independent deep neural architectures, namely, AlexNet, VGG-16, EfficientNet B0, Vanilla CNN, Modified DenseNet, and InceptionV3 + BiLSTM. We test it on two comprehensive datasets, the AUC Distracted Driver Dataset, on which our technique achieves an accuracy of 96.37%, surpassing the previously obtained 95.98%, and on the State Farm Driver Distraction Dataset, on which we attain an accuracy of 99.75%. The 6-Model Ensemble gave an inference time of 0.024 seconds as measured on our machine with Ubuntu 20.04(64-bit) and GPU as GeForce GTX 1080.

**Abstract:** Edge computing enabled smart greenhouse is a representative application of Internet of Things technology, which can monitor the environmental information in real time and employ the information to contribute to intelligent decision-making. In the process, anomaly detection for wireless sensor data plays an important role. However, traditional anomaly detection algorithms originally designed for anomaly detection in static data have not properly considered the inherent characteristics of data stream produced by wireless sensor such as infiniteness, correlations and concept drift, which may pose a considerable challenge on anomaly detection based on data stream, and lead to low detection accuracy and efficiency. First, data stream usually generates quickly which means that it is infinite and enormous, so any traditional off-line anomaly detection algorithm that attempts to store the whole dataset or to scan the dataset multiple times for anomaly detection will run out of memory space. Second, there exist correlations among different data streams, which traditional algorithms hardly consider. Third, the underlying data generation process or data distribution may change over time. Thus, traditional anomaly detection algorithms with no model update will lose their effects. Considering these issues, a novel method (called DLSHiForest) on basis of Locality-Sensitive Hashing and time window technique in this paper is proposed to solve these problems while achieving accurate and efficient detection. Comprehensive experiments are executed using real-world agricultural greenhouse dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results show that our proposal is practicable in addressing challenges of traditional anomaly detection while ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

**Abstract:** Late blight disease is one of the most destructive diseases in potato crop, leading to serious yield losses globally. Accurate diagnosis of the disease at early stage is critical for precision disease control and management. Current farm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual inspection, which is costly, time consuming, subject to individual bias. Recent advances in imaging sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote sensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge. Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant diseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance information beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial information. The proposed method considers the potential disease specific reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity, introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to represent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease attributes in the feature space. We have evaluated the proposed method with the real UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning methods. The experiment results show that the proposed model significantly improves the accuracy performance when considering hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features, comparing to the existing methods only using spectral, or spatial or spectral-spatial features without consider hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features.

**Abstract:** Although learning from data is effective and has achieved significant milestones, it has many challenges and limitations. Learning from data starts from observations and then proceeds to broader generalizations. This framework is controversial in science, yet it has achieved remarkable engineering successes. This paper reflects on some epistemological issues and some of the limitations of the knowledge discovered in data. The document discusses the common perception that getting more data is the key to achieving better machine learning models from theoretical and practical perspectives. The paper sheds some light on the shortcomings of using generic mathematical theories to describe the process. It further highlights the need for theories specialized in learning from data. While more data leverages the performance of machine learning models in general, the relation in practice is shown to be logarithmic at its best; After a specific limit, more data stabilize or degrade the machine learning models. Recent work in reinforcement learning showed that the trend is shifting away from data-oriented approaches and relying more on algorithms. The paper concludes that learning from data is hindered by many limitations. Hence an approach that has an intensional orientation is needed.

**Abstract:** Today, Multi-View Stereo techniques are able to reconstruct robust and detailed 3D models, especially when starting from high-resolution images. However, there are cases in which the resolution of input images is relatively low, for instance, when dealing with old photos, or when hardware constrains the amount of data that can be acquired. In this paper, we investigate if, how, and how much increasing the resolution of such input images through Super-Resolution techniques reflects in quality improvements of the reconstructed 3D models, despite the artifacts that sometimes this may generate. We show that applying a Super-Resolution step before recovering the depth maps in most cases leads to a better 3D model both in the case of PatchMatch-based and deep-learning-based algorithms. The use of Super-Resolution improves especially the completeness of reconstructed models and turns out to be particularly effective in the case of textured scenes.

**Abstract:** Heart disease is the most common reason for human mortality that causes almost one-third of deaths throughout the world. Detecting the disease early increases the chances of survival of the patient and there are several ways a sign of heart disease can be detected early. This research proposes to convert cleansed and normalized heart sound into visual mel scale spectrograms and then using visual domain transfer learning approaches to automatically extract features and categorize between heart sounds. Some of the previous studies found that the spectrogram of various types of heart sounds is visually distinguishable to human eyes, which motivated this study to experiment on visual domain classification approaches for automated heart sound classification. It will use convolution neural network-based architectures i.e. ResNet, MobileNetV2, etc as the automated feature extractors from spectrograms. These well-accepted models in the image domain showed to learn generalized feature representations of cardiac sounds collected from different environments with varying amplitude and noise levels. Model evaluation criteria used were categorical accuracy, precision, recall, and AUROC as the chosen dataset is unbalanced. The proposed approach has been implemented on datasets A and B of the PASCAL heart sound collection and resulted in ~ 90% categorical accuracy and AUROC of ~0.97 for both sets.

**Abstract:** The use of multiple and semantically correlated sources can provide complementary information to each other that may not be evident when working with individual modalities on their own. In this context, multi-modal models can help producing more accurate and robust predictions in machine learning tasks where audio-visual data is available. This paper presents a multi-modal model for automatic scene classification that exploits simultaneously auditory and visual information. The proposed approach makes use of two separate networks which are respectively trained in isolation on audio and visual data, so that each network specializes in a given modality. The visual subnetwork is a pre-trained VGG16 model followed by a bidiretional recurrent layer, while the residual audio subnetwork is based on stacked squeeze-excitation convolutional blocks trained from scratch. After training each subnetwork, the fusion of information from the audio and visual streams is performed at two different stages. The early fusion stage combines features resulting from the last convolutional block of the respective subnetworks at different time steps to feed a bidirectional recurrent structure. The late fusion stage combines the output of the early fusion stage with the independent predictions provided by the two subnetworks, resulting in the final prediction. We evaluate the method using the recently published TAU Audio-Visual Urban Scenes 2021, which contains synchronized audio and video recordings from 12 European cities in 10 different scene classes. The proposed model has been shown to provide an excellent trade-off between prediction performance (86.5%) and system complexity (15M parameters) in the evaluation results of the DCASE 2021 Challenge.

**Abstract:** Estimating Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) is of utmost importance for developing Cyber-Physical and Safety-Critical Systems. The system's scheduler uses the estimated WCET to schedule each task of these systems, and failure may lead to catastrophic events. It is thus imperative to build provably reliable systems. WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when the hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it. Different methodologies measure the WCET, but none of them give early insights on WCET, which is crucial for system development. If the system designers overestimate WCET in the early stage, then it would lead to the overqualified system, which will increase the cost of the final product, and if they underestimate WCET in the early stage, then it would lead to financial loss as the system would not perform as expected. This paper estimates early WCET using Deep Neural Networks as an approximate predictor model for hardware architecture and compiler. This model predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running on the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the Pytorch framework. The resulting WCET is too erroneous to be used as an upper bound on the WCET. However, getting these results in the early stages of system development is an essential prerequisite for the system's dimensioning and configuration of the hardware setup.

**Abstract:** Network telescopes or "Darknets" provide a unique window into Internet-wide malicious activities associated with malware propagation, denial of service attacks, scanning performed for network reconnaissance, and others. Analyses of the resulting data can provide actionable insights to security analysts that can be used to prevent or mitigate cyber-threats. Large Darknets, however, observe millions of nefarious events on a daily basis which makes the transformation of the captured information into meaningful insights challenging. We present a novel framework for characterizing Darknet behavior and its temporal evolution aiming to address this challenge. The proposed framework: (i) Extracts a high dimensional representation of Darknet events composed of features distilled from Darknet data and other external sources; (ii) Learns, in an unsupervised fashion, an information-preserving low-dimensional representation of these events (using deep representation learning) that is amenable to clustering; (iv) Performs clustering of the scanner data in the resulting representation space and provides interpretable insights using optimal decision trees; and (v) Utilizes the clustering outcomes as "signatures" that can be used to detect structural changes in the Darknet activities. We evaluate the proposed system on a large operational Network Telescope and demonstrate its ability to detect real-world, high-impact cybersecurity incidents.

**Abstract:** Education should not be a privilege but a common good. It should be openly accessible to everyone, with as few barriers as possible; even more so for key technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS). Open Educational Resources (OER) are a crucial factor for greater educational equity. In this paper, we describe the specific requirements for OER in ML and DS and argue that it is especially important for these fields to make source files publicly available, leading to Open Source Educational Resources (OSER). We present our view on the collaborative development of OSER, the challenges this poses, and first steps towards their solutions. We outline how OSER can be used for blended learning scenarios and share our experiences in university education. Finally, we discuss additional challenges such as credit assignment or granting certificates.

**Abstract:** The electrical signal emitted by the eyes movement produces a very strong artifact on EEG signaldue to its close proximity to the sensors and abundance of occurrence. In the context of detectingeye blink artifacts in EEG waveforms for further removal and signal purification, multiple strategieswhere proposed in the literature. Most commonly applied methods require the use of a large numberof electrodes, complex equipment for sampling and processing data. The goal of this work is to createa reliable and user independent algorithm for detecting and removing eye blink in EEG signals usingCNN (convolutional neural network). For training and validation, three sets of public EEG data wereused. All three sets contain samples obtained while the recruited subjects performed assigned tasksthat included blink voluntarily in specific moments, watch a video and read an article. The modelused in this study was able to have an embracing understanding of all the features that distinguish atrivial EEG signal from a signal contaminated with eye blink artifacts without being overfitted byspecific features that only occurred in the situations when the signals were registered.

**Abstract:** With the rapid growth of the number of devices on the Internet, malware poses a threat not only to the affected devices but also their ability to use said devices to launch attacks on the Internet ecosystem. Rapid malware classification is an important tools to combat that threat. One of the successful approaches to classification is based on malware images and deep learning. While many deep learning architectures are very accurate they usually take a long time to train. In this work we perform experiments on multiple well known, pre-trained, deep network architectures in the context of transfer learning. We show that almost all them classify malware accurately with a very short training period.

Computational co-creativity tools can aid them, but first, AI and HCI researchers must gather requirements and determine design heuristics to build effective co-creative tools. In this work, we present a participatory design study that categorizes and analyzes game AI designers' workflows, goals, and expectations for such tools.

**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a method to learn probability distributions using sample path data from stochastic differential equations. Specifically, we consider temporally evolving probability distributions (e.g., those produced by integrating local or nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations). We analyze this evolution through machine learning assisted construction of a time-dependent mapping that takes a reference distribution (say, a Gaussian) to each and every instance of our evolving distribution. If the reference distribution is the initial condition of a Fokker-Planck equation, what we learn is the time-T map of the corresponding solution. Specifically, the learned map is a normalizing flow that deforms the support of the reference density to the support of each and every density snapshot in time. We demonstrate that this approach can learn solutions to non-local Fokker-Planck equations, such as those arising in systems driven by both Brownian and L√©vy noise. We present examples with two- and three-dimensional, uni- and multimodal distributions to validate the method.

**Abstract:** Histopathology digital scans are large-size images that contain valuable information at the pixel level. Content-based comparison of these images is a challenging task. This study proposes a content-based similarity measure for high-resolution gigapixel histopathology images. The proposed similarity measure is an expansion of cosine vector similarity to a matrix. Each image is divided into same-size patches with a meaningful amount of information (i.e., contained enough tissue). The similarity is measured by the extraction of patch-level deep embeddings of the last pooling layer of a pre-trained deep model at four different magnification levels, namely, 1x, 2.5x, 5x, and 10x magnifications. In addition, for faster measurement, embedding reduction is investigated. Finally, to assess the proposed method, an image search method is implemented. Results show that the similarity measure represents the slide labels with a maximum accuracy of 93.18\% for top-5 search at 5x magnification.

In addition to incorporating project-based learning in our courses, we aim to develop project-based learning components aligned with real-world tasks, including experimental design and execution, report writing, oral presentation, and peer-reviewing. This paper describes the organization of our project-based machine learning courses with a particular emphasis on the class project components and shares our resources with instructors who would like to include similar elements in their courses.

**Abstract:** The dominant paradigm in spatiotemporal action detection is to classify actions using spatiotemporal features learned by 2D or 3D Convolutional Networks. We argue that several actions are characterized by their context, such as relevant objects and actors present in the video. To this end, we introduce an architecture based on self-attention and Graph Convolutional Networks in order to model contextual cues, such as actor-actor and actor-object interactions, to improve human action detection in video. We are interested in achieving this in a weakly-supervised setting, i.e. using as less annotations as possible in terms of action bounding boxes. Our model aids explainability by visualizing the learned context as an attention map, even for actions and objects unseen during training. We evaluate how well our model highlights the relevant context by introducing a quantitative metric based on recall of objects retrieved by attention maps. Our model relies on a 3D convolutional RGB stream, and does not require expensive optical flow computation. We evaluate our models on the DALY dataset, which consists of human-object interaction actions. Experimental results show that our contextualized approach outperforms a baseline action detection approach by more than 2 points in Video-mAP.

**Abstract:** There are many important applications for detecting and localizing specific sound events within long, untrimmed documents including keyword spotting, medical observation, and bioacoustic monitoring for conservation. Deep learning techniques often set the state-of-the-art for these tasks. However, for some types of events, there is insufficient labeled data to train deep learning models. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to few-shot sound event detection utilizing region proposals and the Perceiver architecture, which is capable of accurately localizing sound events with very few examples of each class of interest. Motivated by a lack of suitable benchmark datasets for few-shot audio event detection, we generate and evaluate on two novel episodic rare sound event datasets: one using clips of celebrity speech as the sound event, and the other using environmental sounds. Our highest performing proposed few-shot approaches achieve 0.575 and 0.672 F1-score, respectively, with 5-shot 5-way tasks on these two datasets. These represent absolute improvements of 0.200 and 0.234 over strong proposal-free few-shot sound event detection baselines.

**Abstract:** A central object in the computational studies of rare events is the committor function. Though costly to compute, the committor function encodes complete mechanistic information of the processes involving rare events, including reaction rates and transition-state ensembles. Under the framework of transition path theory (TPT), recent work [1] proposes an algorithm where a feedback loop couples a neural network that models the committor function with importance sampling, mainly umbrella sampling, which collects data needed for adaptive training. In this work, we show additional modifications are needed to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The first modification adds elements of supervised learning, which allows the neural network to improve its prediction by fitting to sample-mean estimates of committor values obtained from short molecular dynamics trajectories. The second modification replaces the committor-based umbrella sampling with the finite-temperature string (FTS) method, which enables homogeneous sampling in regions where transition pathways are located. We test our modifications on low-dimensional systems with non-convex potential energy where reference solutions can be found via analytical or the finite element methods, and show how combining supervised learning and the FTS method yields accurate computation of committor functions and reaction rates. We also provide an error analysis for algorithms that use the FTS method, using which reaction rates can be accurately estimated during training with a small number of samples.

**Abstract:** In classic program synthesis algorithms, such as counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS), the algorithms alternate between a synthesis phase and an oracle (verification) phase. Many synthesis algorithms use a white-box oracle based on satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers to provide counterexamples. But what if a white-box oracle is either not available or not easy to work with? We present a framework for solving a general class of oracle-guided synthesis problems which we term synthesis modulo oracles. In this setting, oracles may be black boxes with a query-response interface defined by the synthesis problem. As a necessary component of this framework, we also formalize the problem of satisfiability modulo theories and oracles, and present an algorithm for solving this problem. We implement a prototype solver for satisfiability and synthesis modulo oracles and demonstrate that, by using oracles that execute functions not easily modeled in SMT-constraints, such as recursive functions or oracles that incorporate compilation and execution of code, SMTO and SyMO are able to solve problems beyond the abilities of standard SMT and synthesis solvers.

**Abstract:** Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of measuring the brain's electrical activity, using non-invasive scalp electrodes. In this article, we propose the Portiloop, a deep learning-based portable and low-cost device enabling the neuroscience community to capture EEG, process it in real time, detect patterns of interest, and respond with precisely-timed stimulation. The core of the Portiloop is a System on Chip composed of an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). After being converted to digital by the ADC, the EEG signal is processed in the FPGA. The FPGA contains an ad-hoc Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with convolutional and recurrent units, directly implemented in hardware. The output of the ANN is then used to trigger the user-defined feedback. We use the Portiloop to develop a real-time sleep spindle stimulating application, as a case study. Sleep spindles are a specific type of transient oscillation ($\sim$2.5 s, 12-16 Hz) that are observed in EEG recordings, and are related to memory consolidation during sleep. We tested the Portiloop's capacity to detect and stimulate sleep spindles in real time using an existing database of EEG sleep recordings. With 71% for both precision and recall as compared with expert labels, the system is able to stimulate spindles within $\sim$300 ms of their onset, enabling experimental manipulation of early the entire spindle. The Portiloop can be extended to detect and stimulate other neural events in EEG. It is fully available to the research community as an open science project.

**Abstract:** Emulators that can bypass computationally expensive scientific calculations with high accuracy and speed can enable new studies of fundamental science as well as more potential applications. In this work we focus on solving a system of constraint equations efficiently using a new machine learning approach that we call self-learning emulation. A self-learning emulator is an active learning protocol that can rapidly solve a system of equations over some range of control parameters. The key ingredient is a fast estimate of the emulator error that becomes progressively more accurate as the emulator improves. This acceleration is possible because the emulator itself is used to estimate the error, and we illustrate with two examples. The first uses cubic spline interpolation to find the roots of a polynomial with variable coefficients. The second example uses eigenvector continuation to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a large Hamiltonian matrix that depends on several control parameters. We envision future applications of self-learning emulators for solving systems of algebraic equations, linear and nonlinear differential equations, and linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems.

**Abstract:** Ultrasound is the preferred choice for early screening of dense breast cancer. Clinically, doctors have to manually write the screening report which is time-consuming and laborious, and it is easy to miss and miswrite. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for efficiently generating personalized breast ultrasound screening preliminary reports by AI, especially for benign and normal cases which account for the majority. Doctors then make simple adjustments or corrections to quickly generate final reports. The proposed approach has been tested using a database of 1133 breast tumor instances. Experimental results indicate this pipeline improves doctors' work efficiency by up to 90%, which greatly reduces repetitive work.

**Abstract:** Reverse engineers would benefit from identifiers like function names, but these are usually unavailable in binaries. Training a machine learning model to predict function names automatically is promising but fundamentally hard due to the enormous number of classes. In this paper, we introduce eXtreme Function Labeling (XFL), an extreme multi-label learning approach to selecting appropriate labels for binary functions. XFL splits function names into tokens, treating each as an informative label akin to the problem of tagging texts in natural language. To capture the semantics of binary code, we introduce DEXTER, a novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features with local context from the call graph and global context from the entire binary. We demonstrate that XFL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to function labeling on a dataset of over 10,000 binaries from the Debian project, achieving a precision of 82.5%. We also study combinations of XFL with different published embeddings for binary functions and show that DEXTER consistently improves over the state of the art in information gain. As a result, we are able to show that binary function labeling is best phrased in terms of multi-label learning, and that binary function embeddings benefit from moving beyond just learning from syntax.

**Abstract:** Towards predicting patch correctness in APR, we propose a simple, but novel hypothesis on how the link between the patch behaviour and failing test specifications can be drawn: similar failing test cases should require similar patches. We then propose BATS, an unsupervised learning-based system to predict patch correctness by checking patch Behaviour Against failing Test Specification. BATS exploits deep representation learning models for code and patches: for a given failing test case, the yielded embedding is used to compute similarity metrics in the search for historical similar test cases in order to identify the associated applied patches, which are then used as a proxy for assessing generated patch correctness. Experimentally, we first validate our hypothesis by assessing whether ground-truth developer patches cluster together in the same way that their associated failing test cases are clustered. Then, after collecting a large dataset of 1278 plausible patches (written by developers or generated by some 32 APR tools), we use BATS to predict correctness: BATS achieves an AUC between 0.557 to 0.718 and a recall between 0.562 and 0.854 in identifying correct patches. Compared against previous work, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art performance in patch correctness prediction, without the need for large labeled patch datasets in contrast with prior machine learning-based approaches. While BATS is constrained by the availability of similar test cases, we show that it can still be complementary to existing approaches: used in conjunction with a recent approach implementing supervised learning, BATS improves the overall recall in detecting correct patches. We finally show that BATS can be complementary to the state-of-the-art PATCH-SIM dynamic approach of identifying the correct patches for APR tools.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in predictive machine learning has led to its application in various use cases in manufacturing. Most research focused on maximising predictive accuracy without addressing the uncertainty associated with it. While accuracy is important, focusing primarily on it poses an overfitting danger, exposing manufacturers to risk, ultimately hindering the adoption of these techniques. In this paper, we determine the sources of uncertainty in machine learning and establish the success criteria of a machine learning system to function well under uncertainty in a cyber-physical manufacturing system (CPMS) scenario. Then, we propose a multi-agent system architecture which leverages probabilistic machine learning as a means of achieving such criteria. We propose possible scenarios for which our proposed architecture is useful and discuss future work. Experimentally, we implement Bayesian Neural Networks for multi-tasks classification on a public dataset for the real-time condition monitoring of a hydraulic system and demonstrate the usefulness of the system by evaluating the probability of a prediction being accurate given its uncertainty. We deploy these models using our proposed agent-based framework and integrate web visualisation to demonstrate its real-time feasibility.

**Abstract:** Training and inference in deep neural networks (DNNs) has, due to a steady increase in architectural complexity and data set size, lead to the development of strategies for reducing time and space requirements of DNN training and inference, which is of particular importance in scenarios where training takes place in resource constrained computation environments or inference is part of a time critical application. In this survey, we aim to provide a general overview and categorization of state-of-the-art (SOTA) of techniques to reduced DNN training and inference time and space complexities with a particular focus on architectural adaptions.

**Abstract:** This paper aims to demonstrate the efficiency of the Adversarial Open Domain Adaption framework for sketch-to-photo synthesis. The unsupervised open domain adaption for generating realistic photos from a hand-drawn sketch is challenging as there is no such sketch of that class for training data. The absence of learning supervision and the huge domain gap between both the freehand drawing and picture domains make it hard. We present an approach that learns both sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation to synthesise the missing freehand drawings from pictures. Due to the domain gap between synthetic sketches and genuine ones, the generator trained on false drawings may produce unsatisfactory results when dealing with drawings of lacking classes. To address this problem, we offer a simple but effective open-domain sampling and optimization method that tricks the generator into considering false drawings as genuine. Our approach generalises the learnt sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch mappings from in-domain input to open-domain categories. On the Scribble and SketchyCOCO datasets, we compared our technique to the most current competing methods. For many types of open-domain drawings, our model outperforms impressive results in synthesising accurate colour, substance, and retaining the structural layout.

**Abstract:** Manifold-valued functional data analysis (FDA) recently becomes an active area of research motivated by the raising availability of trajectories or longitudinal data observed on non-linear manifolds. The challenges of analyzing such data come from many aspects, including infinite dimensionality and nonlinearity, as well as time-domain or phase variability. In this paper, we study the amplitude part of manifold-valued functions on $\mathbb{S}^2$, which is invariant to random time warping or re-parameterization. Utilizing the nice geometry of $\mathbb{S}^2$, we develop a set of efficient and accurate tools for temporal alignment of functions, geodesic computing, and sample mean calculation. At the heart of these tools, they rely on gradient descent algorithms with carefully derived gradients. We show the advantages of these newly developed tools over its competitors with extensive simulations and real data and demonstrate the importance of considering the amplitude part of functions instead of mixing it with phase variability in manifold-valued FDA.

**Abstract:** Assured AI in unrestricted settings is a critical problem. Our framework addresses AI assurance challenges lying at the intersection of domain adaptation, fairness, and counterfactuals analysis, operating via the discovery and intervention on factors of variations in data (e.g. weather or illumination conditions) that significantly affect the robustness of AI models. Robustness is understood here as insensitivity of the model performance to variations in sensitive factors. Sensitive factors are traditionally set in a supervised setting, whereby factors are known a-priori (e.g. for fairness this could be factors like sex or race). In contrast, our motivation is real-life scenarios where less, or nothing, is actually known a-priori about certain factors that cause models to fail. This leads us to consider various settings (unsupervised, domain generalization, semi-supervised) that correspond to different degrees of incomplete knowledge about those factors. Therefore, our two step approach works by a) discovering sensitive factors that cause AI systems to fail in a unsupervised fashion, and then b) intervening models to lessen these factor's influence. Our method considers 3 interventions consisting of Augmentation, Coherence, and Adversarial Interventions (ACAI). We demonstrate the ability for interventions on discovered/source factors to generalize to target/real factors. We also demonstrate how adaptation to real factors of variations can be performed in the semi-supervised case where some target factor labels are known, via automated intervention selection. Experiments show that our approach improves on baseline models, with regard to achieving optimal utility vs. sensitivity/robustness tradeoffs.

**Abstract:** The default paradigm in the forecasting of human behavior in social conversations, involves selecting specific future semantic events of interest (e.g. speaker turn changes, group leaving) and then identifying their relationships to low-level nonverbal cues. A common hurdle in such top-down approaches is the limited availability of event-labeled data for supervised learning, stemming from the infrequency of such events. To tackle this challenge, we propose to cast forecasting into a novel bottom-up self-supervised problem to leverage the larger amount of low-level behavior cues. We formalize the task of Social Cue Forecasting (SCF), and characterize the specific modeling challenges involved. To address these we build upon key observations from social science literature and propose the Social Process (SP) models--socially aware sequence-to-sequence models that view each conversation group as a meta-learning task to account for group-specific dynamics. Our SP models learn event agnostic representations of future cues for each participant, while capturing global uncertainty by jointly reasoning about the future for all members of the group. For this novel task of SCF, improved empirical performance over non meta-learning models on real-world behavior data validates our meta-learning approach. Moreover, ablations and comparison against meta-learning models with similar assumptions validate our specific modeling choices for this task.

**Abstract:** Quantization is a technique for reducing deep neural networks (DNNs) training and inference times, which is crucial for training in resource constrained environments or applications where inference is time critical. State-of-the-art (SOTA) quantization approaches focus on post-training quantization, i.e., quantization of pre-trained DNNs for speeding up inference. While work on quantized training exists, most approaches require refinement in full precision (usually single precision) in the final training phase or enforce a global word length across the entire DNN. This leads to suboptimal assignments of bit-widths to layers and, consequently, suboptimal resource usage. In an attempt to overcome such limitations, we introduce AdaPT, a new fixed-point quantized sparsifying training strategy. AdaPT decides about precision switches between training epochs based on information theoretic conditions. The goal is to determine on a per-layer basis the lowest precision that causes no quantization-induced information loss while keeping the precision high enough such that future learning steps do not suffer from vanishing gradients. The benefits of the resulting fully quantized DNN are evaluated based on an analytical performance model which we develop. We illustrate that an average speedup of 1.27 compared to standard training in float32 with an average accuracy increase of 0.98% can be achieved for AlexNet/ResNet on CIFAR10/100 and we further demonstrate these AdaPT trained models achieve an average inference speedup of 2.33 with a model size reduction of 0.52.

**Abstract:** We perform approximate inference in state-space models with nonlinear state transitions. Without parameterizing a generative model, we apply Bayesian update formulas using a local linearity approximation parameterized by neural networks. It comes accompanied by a maximum likelihood objective that requires no supervision via uncorrupt observations or ground truth latent states. The optimization backpropagates through a recursion similar to the classical Kalman filter and smoother. Additionally, using an approximate conditional independence, we can perform smoothing without having to parameterize a separate model. In scientific applications, domain knowledge can give a linear approximation of the latent transition maps, which we can easily incorporate into our model. Usage of such domain knowledge is reflected in excellent results (despite our model's simplicity) on the chaotic Lorenz system compared to fully supervised and variational inference methods. Finally, we show competitive results on an audio denoising experiment.

**Abstract:** The management of networks is automated by closed loops. Concurrent closed loops aiming for individual optimization cause conflicts which, left unresolved, leads to significant degradation in performance indicators, resulting in sub-optimal network performance. Centralized optimization avoids conflicts, but impractical in large-scale networks for time-critical applications. Distributed, pervasive intelligence is therefore envisaged in the evolution to B5G networks. In this letter, we propose a Q-Learning-based distributed architecture (QLC), addressing the conflict issue by encouraging cooperation among intelligent agents. We design a realistic B5G network slice auto-scaling model and validate the performance of QLC via simulations, justifying further research in this direction.
