**Abstract:** In cross-lingual language models, representations for many different languages live in the same space. Here, we investigate the linguistic and non-linguistic factors affecting sentence-level alignment in cross-lingual pretrained language models for 101 languages and 5,050 language pairs. Using BERT-based LaBSE and BiLSTM-based LASER as our models, and the Bible as our corpus, we compute a task-based measure of cross-lingual alignment in the form of bitext retrieval performance, as well as four intrinsic measures of vector space alignment and isomorphism. We then examine a range of linguistic, quasi-linguistic, and training-related features as potential predictors of these alignment metrics. The results of our analyses show that word order agreement and agreement in morphological complexity are two of the strongest linguistic predictors of cross-linguality. We also note in-family training data as a stronger predictor than language-specific training data across the board. We verify some of our linguistic findings by looking at the effect of morphological segmentation on English-Inuktitut alignment, in addition to examining the effect of word order agreement on isomorphism for 66 zero-shot language pairs from a different corpus. We make the data and code for our experiments publicly available.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces V-SysId, a novel method that enables simultaneous keypoint discovery, 3D system identification, and extrinsic camera calibration from an unlabeled video taken from a static camera, using only the family of equations of motion of the object of interest as weak supervision. V-SysId takes keypoint trajectory proposals and alternates between maximum likelihood parameter estimation and extrinsic camera calibration, before applying a suitable selection criterion to identify the track of interest. This is then used to train a keypoint tracking model using supervised learning. Results on a range of settings (robotics, physics, physiology) highlight the utility of this approach.

**Abstract:** Natural language generation (NLG) spans a broad range of tasks, each of which serves for specific objectives and desires different properties of generated text. The complexity makes automatic evaluation of NLG particularly challenging. Previous work has typically focused on a single task and developed individual evaluation metrics based on specific intuitions. In this paper, we propose a unifying perspective based on the nature of information change in NLG tasks, including compression (e.g., summarization), transduction (e.g., text rewriting), and creation (e.g., dialog). Information alignment between input, context, and output text plays a common central role in characterizing the generation. With automatic alignment prediction models, we develop a family of interpretable metrics that are suitable for evaluating key aspects of different NLG tasks, often without need of gold reference data. Experiments show the uniformly designed metrics achieve stronger or comparable correlations with human judgement compared to state-of-the-art metrics in each of diverse tasks, including text summarization, style transfer, and knowledge-grounded dialog.

**Abstract:** Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is a novel area of AI research which seeks to combine traditional rules-based AI approaches with modern deep learning techniques. Neuro-symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. They have also been shown to obtain high accuracy with significantly less training data than traditional models. Due to the recency of the field's emergence and relative sparsity of published results, the performance characteristics of these models are not well understood. In this paper, we describe and analyze the performance characteristics of three recent neuro-symbolic models. We find that symbolic models have less potential parallelism than traditional neural models due to complex control flow and low-operational-intensity operations, such as scalar multiplication and tensor addition. However, the neural aspect of computation dominates the symbolic part in cases where they are clearly separable. We also find that data movement poses a potential bottleneck, as it does in many ML workloads.

**Abstract:** Previous work on planning as active inference addresses finite horizon problems and solutions valid for online planning. We propose solving the general Stochastic Shortest-Path Markov Decision Process (SSP MDP) as probabilistic inference. Furthermore, we discuss online and offline methods for planning under uncertainty. In an SSP MDP, the horizon is indefinite and unknown a priori. SSP MDPs generalize finite and infinite horizon MDPs and are widely used in the artificial intelligence community. Additionally, we highlight some of the differences between solving an MDP using dynamic programming approaches widely used in the artificial intelligence community and approaches used in the active inference community.

**Abstract:** Several neural-based metrics have been recently proposed to evaluate machine translation quality. However, all of them resort to point estimates, which provide limited information at segment level. This is made worse as they are trained on noisy, biased and scarce human judgements, often resulting in unreliable quality predictions. In this paper, we introduce uncertainty-aware MT evaluation and analyze the trustworthiness of the predicted quality. We combine the COMET framework with two uncertainty estimation methods, Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensembles, to obtain quality scores along with confidence intervals. We compare the performance of our uncertainty-aware MT evaluation methods across multiple language pairs from the QT21 dataset and the WMT20 metrics task, augmented with MQM annotations. We experiment with varying numbers of references and further discuss the usefulness of uncertainty-aware quality estimation (without references) to flag possibly critical translation mistakes.

**Abstract:** An ideal integration of autonomous agents in a human world implies that they are able to collaborate on human terms. In particular, theory of mind plays an important role in maintaining common ground during human collaboration and communication. To enable theory of mind modeling in situated interactions, we introduce a fine-grained dataset of collaborative tasks performed by pairs of human subjects in the 3D virtual blocks world of Minecraft. It provides information that captures partners' beliefs of the world and of each other as an interaction unfolds, bringing abundant opportunities to study human collaborative behaviors in situated language communication. As a first step towards our goal of developing embodied AI agents able to infer belief states of collaborative partners in situ, we build and present results on computational models for several theory of mind tasks.

**Abstract:** Automatically discovering a process model from an event log is the prime problem in process mining. This task is so far approached as an unsupervised learning problem through graph synthesis algorithms. Algorithmic design decisions and heuristics allow for efficiently finding models in a reduced search space. However, design decisions and heuristics are derived from assumptions about how a given behavioral description - an event log - translates into a process model and were not learned from actual models which introduce biases in the solutions. In this paper, we explore the problem of supervised learning of a process discovery technique D. We introduce a technique for training an ML-based model D using graph convolutional neural networks; D translates a given input event log into a sound Petri net. We show that training D on synthetically generated pairs of input logs and output models allows D to translate previously unseen synthetic and several real-life event logs into sound, arbitrarily structured models of comparable accuracy and simplicity as existing state of the art techniques for discovering imperative process models. We analyze the limitations of the proposed technique and outline alleys for future work.

**Abstract:** Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is known to suffer from a beam-search problem: after a certain point, increasing beam size causes an overall drop in translation quality. This effect is especially pronounced for long sentences. While much work was done analyzing this phenomenon, primarily for autoregressive NMT models, there is still no consensus on its underlying cause. In this work, we analyze errors that cause major quality degradation with large beams in NMT and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We show that a factor that strongly contributes to the quality degradation with large beams is \textit{dataset length-bias} - \textit{NMT datasets are strongly biased towards short sentences}. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data augmentation technique -- \textit{Multi-Sentence Resampling (MSR)}. This technique extends the training examples by concatenating several sentences from the original dataset to make a long training example. We demonstrate that MSR significantly reduces degradation with growing beam size and improves final translation quality on the IWSTL$15$ En-Vi, IWSTL$17$ En-Fr, and WMT$14$ En-De datasets.

**Abstract:** The goal of stance detection is to determine the viewpoint expressed in a piece of text towards a target. These viewpoints or contexts are often expressed in many different languages depending on the user and the platform, which can be a local news outlet, a social media platform, a news forum, etc. Most research in stance detection, however, has been limited to working with a single language and on a few limited targets, with little work on cross-lingual stance detection. Moreover, non-English sources of labelled data are often scarce and present additional challenges. Recently, large multilingual language models have substantially improved the performance on many non-English tasks, especially such with limited numbers of examples. This highlights the importance of model pre-training and its ability to learn from few examples. In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study of cross-lingual stance detection to date: we experiment with 15 diverse datasets in 12 languages from 6 language families, and with 6 low-resource evaluation settings each. For our experiments, we build on pattern-exploiting training, proposing the addition of a novel label encoder to simplify the verbalisation procedure. We further propose sentiment-based generation of stance data for pre-training, which shows sizeable improvement of more than 6% F1 absolute in low-shot settings compared to several strong baselines.

**Abstract:** Answering questions asked from instructional corpora such as E-manuals, recipe books, etc., has been far less studied than open-domain factoid context-based question answering. This can be primarily attributed to the absence of standard benchmark datasets. In this paper we meticulously create a large amount of data connected with E-manuals and develop suitable algorithm to exploit it. We collect E-Manual Corpus, a huge corpus of 307,957 E-manuals and pretrain RoBERTa on this large corpus. We create various benchmark QA datasets which include question answer pairs curated by experts based upon two E-manuals, real user questions from Community Question Answering Forum pertaining to E-manuals etc. We introduce EMQAP (E-Manual Question Answering Pipeline) that answers questions pertaining to electronics devices. Built upon the pretrained RoBERTa, it harbors a supervised multi-task learning framework which efficiently performs the dual tasks of identifying the section in the E-manual where the answer can be found and the exact answer span within that section. For E-Manual annotated question-answer pairs, we show an improvement of about 40% in ROUGE-L F1 scores over the most competitive baseline. We perform a detailed ablation study and establish the versatility of EMQAP across different circumstances.

**Abstract:** Enabling open-domain dialogue systems to ask clarifying questions when appropriate is an important direction for improving the quality of the system response. Namely, for cases when a user request is not specific enough for a conversation system to provide an answer right away, it is desirable to ask a clarifying question to increase the chances of retrieving a satisfying answer. To address the problem of 'asking clarifying questions in open-domain dialogues': (1) we collect and release a new dataset focused on open-domain single- and multi-turn conversations, (2) we benchmark several state-of-the-art neural baselines, and (3) we propose a pipeline consisting of offline and online steps for evaluating the quality of clarifying questions in various dialogues. These contributions are suitable as a foundation for further research.

<p>

**Abstract:** Recently reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for quadrupedal locomotion, which can save the manual effort in conventional approaches such as designing skill-specific controllers. However, due to the complex nonlinear dynamics in quadrupedal robots and reward sparsity, it is still difficult for RL to learn effective gaits from scratch, especially in challenging tasks such as walking over the balance beam. To alleviate such difficulty, we propose a novel RL-based approach that contains an evolutionary foot trajectory generator. Unlike prior methods that use a fixed trajectory generator, the generator continually optimizes the shape of the output trajectory for the given task, providing diversified motion priors to guide the policy learning. The policy is trained with reinforcement learning to output residual control signals that fit different gaits. We then optimize the trajectory generator and policy network alternatively to stabilize the training and share the exploratory data to improve sample efficiency. As a result, our approach can solve a range of challenging tasks in simulation by learning from scratch, including walking on a balance beam and crawling through the cave. To further verify the effectiveness of our approach, we deploy the controller learned in the simulation on a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot, and it can successfully traverse challenging scenarios with efficient gaits.

**Abstract:** Sequence models are a critical component of modern NLP systems, but their predictions are difficult to explain. We consider model explanations though rationales, subsets of context that can explain individual model predictions. We find sequential rationales by solving a combinatorial optimization: the best rationale is the smallest subset of input tokens that would predict the same output as the full sequence. Enumerating all subsets is intractable, so we propose an efficient greedy algorithm to approximate this objective. The algorithm, which is called greedy rationalization, applies to any model. For this approach to be effective, the model should form compatible conditional distributions when making predictions on incomplete subsets of the context. This condition can be enforced with a short fine-tuning step. We study greedy rationalization on language modeling and machine translation. Compared to existing baselines, greedy rationalization is best at optimizing the combinatorial objective and provides the most faithful rationales. On a new dataset of annotated sequential rationales, greedy rationales are most similar to human rationales.

**Abstract:** Have you ever looked at a painting and wondered what is the story behind it? This work presents a framework to bring art closer to people by generating comprehensive descriptions of fine-art paintings. Generating informative descriptions for artworks, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires to 1) describe multiple aspects of the image such as its style, content, or composition, and 2) provide background and contextual knowledge about the artist, their influences, or the historical period. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description framework, which modules the generated sentences according to three artistic topics and, additionally, enhances each description with external knowledge. The framework is validated through an exhaustive analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, as well as a comparative human evaluation, demonstrating outstanding results in terms of both topic diversity and information veracity.

**Abstract:** The fundamental goal of business data analysis is to improve business decisions using data. Business users such as sales, marketing, product, or operations managers often make decisions to achieve key performance indicator (KPI) goals such as increasing customer retention, decreasing cost, and increasing sales. To discover the relationship between data attributes hypothesized to be drivers and those corresponding to KPIs of interest, business users currently need to perform lengthy exploratory analyses, considering multitudes of combinations and scenarios, slicing, dicing, and transforming the data accordingly. For example, analyzing customer retention across quarters of the year or suggesting optimal media channels across strata of customers. However, the increasing complexity of datasets combined with the cognitive limitations of humans makes it challenging to carry over multiple hypotheses, even for simple datasets. Therefore mentally performing such analyses is hard. Existing commercial tools either provide partial solutions whose effectiveness remains unclear or fail to cater to business users.
  Here we argue for four functionalities that we believe are necessary to enable business users to interactively learn and reason about the relationships (functions) between sets of data attributes, facilitating data-driven decision making. We implement these functionalities in SystemD, an interactive visual analysis system enabling business users to experiment with the data by asking what-if questions. We evaluate the system through three business use cases: marketing mix modeling analysis, customer retention analysis, and deal closing analysis, and report on feedback from multiple business users. Overall, business users find SystemD intuitive and useful for quick testing and validation of their hypotheses around interested KPI as well as in making effective and fast data-driven decisions.

<p>

**Abstract:** We present a multi-camera visual-inertial odometry system based on factor graph optimization which estimates motion by using all cameras simultaneously while retaining a fixed overall feature budget. We focus on motion tracking in challenging environments, such as narrow corridors, dark spaces with aggressive motions, and abrupt lighting changes. These scenarios cause traditional monocular or stereo odometry to fail. While tracking motion with extra cameras should theoretically prevent failures, it leads to additional complexity and computational burden. To overcome these challenges, we introduce two novel methods to improve multi-camera feature tracking. First, instead of tracking features separately in each camera, we track features continuously as they move from one camera to another. This increases accuracy and achieves a more compact factor graph representation. Second, we select a fixed budget of tracked features across the cameras to reduce back-end optimization time. We have found that using a smaller set of informative features can maintain the same tracking accuracy. Our proposed method was extensively tested using a hardware-synchronized device consisting of an IMU and four cameras (a front stereo pair and two lateral) in scenarios including: an underground mine, large open spaces, and building interiors with narrow stairs and corridors. Compared to stereo-only state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry methods, our approach reduces the drift rate, relative pose error, by up to 80% in translation and 39% in rotation.

**Abstract:** We study the problem of recommending relevant products to users in relatively resource-scarce markets by leveraging data from similar, richer in resource auxiliary markets. We hypothesize that data from one market can be used to improve performance in another. Only a few studies have been conducted in this area, partly due to the lack of publicly available experimental data. To this end, we collect and release XMarket, a large dataset covering 18 local markets on 16 different product categories, featuring 52.5 million user-item interactions. We introduce and formalize the problem of cross-market product recommendation, i.e., market adaptation. We explore different market-adaptation techniques inspired by state-of-the-art domain-adaptation and meta-learning approaches and propose a novel neural approach for market adaptation, named FOREC. Our model follows a three-step procedure -- pre-training, forking, and fine-tuning -- in order to fully utilize the data from an auxiliary market as well as the target market. We conduct extensive experiments studying the impact of market adaptation on different pairs of markets. Our proposed approach demonstrates robust effectiveness, consistently improving the performance on target markets compared to competitive baselines selected for our analysis. In particular, FOREC improves on average 24% and up to 50% in terms of nDCG@10, compared to the NMF baseline. Our analysis and experiments suggest specific future directions in this research area. We release our data and code for academic purposes.

**Abstract:** This work proposes an extensive analysis of the Transformer architecture in the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) setting. Focusing on the encoder-decoder attention mechanism, we prove that attention weights systematically make alignment errors by relying mainly on uninformative tokens from the source sequence. However, we observe that NMT models assign attention to these tokens to regulate the contribution in the prediction of the two contexts, the source and the prefix of the target sequence. We provide evidence about the influence of wrong alignments on the model behavior, demonstrating that the encoder-decoder attention mechanism is well suited as an interpretability method for NMT. Finally, based on our analysis, we propose methods that largely reduce the word alignment error rate compared to standard induced alignments from attention weights.

**Abstract:** Low-resource Relation Extraction (LRE) aims to extract relation facts from limited labeled corpora when human annotation is scarce. Existing works either utilize self-training scheme to generate pseudo labels that will cause the gradual drift problem, or leverage meta-learning scheme which does not solicit feedback explicitly. To alleviate selection bias due to the lack of feedback loops in existing LRE learning paradigms, we developed a Gradient Imitation Reinforcement Learning method to encourage pseudo label data to imitate the gradient descent direction on labeled data and bootstrap its optimization capability through trial and error. We also propose a framework called GradLRE, which handles two major scenarios in low-resource relation extraction. Besides the scenario where unlabeled data is sufficient, GradLRE handles the situation where no unlabeled data is available, by exploiting a contextualized augmentation method to generate data. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GradLRE on low resource relation extraction when comparing with baselines.

**Abstract:** In recent years, reinforcement learning and learning-based control -- as well as the study of their safety, crucial for deployment in real-world robots -- have gained significant traction. However, to adequately gauge the progress and applicability of new results, we need the tools to equitably compare the approaches proposed by the controls and reinforcement learning communities. Here, we propose a new open-source benchmark suite, called safe-control-gym. Our starting point is OpenAI's Gym API, which is one of the de facto standard in reinforcement learning research. Yet, we highlight the reasons for its limited appeal to control theory researchers -- and safe control, in particular. E.g., the lack of analytical models and constraint specifications. Thus, we propose to extend this API with (i) the ability to specify (and query) symbolic models and constraints and (ii) introduce simulated disturbances in the control inputs, measurements, and inertial properties. We provide implementations for three dynamic systems -- the cart-pole, 1D, and 2D quadrotor -- and two control tasks -- stabilization and trajectory tracking. To demonstrate our proposal -- and in an attempt to bring research communities closer together -- we show how to use safe-control-gym to quantitatively compare the control performance, data efficiency, and safety of multiple approaches from the areas of traditional control, learning-based control, and reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:** Navigating a large-scaled robot in unknown and cluttered height-constrained environments is challenging. Not only is a fast and reliable planning algorithm required to go around obstacles, the robot should also be able to change its intrinsic dimension by crouching in order to travel underneath height constrained regions. There are few mobile robots that are capable of handling such a challenge, and bipedal robots provide a solution. However, as bipedal robots have nonlinear and hybrid dynamics, trajectory planning while ensuring dynamic feasibility and safety on these robots is challenging. This paper presents an end-to-end vision-aided autonomous navigation framework which leverages three layers of planners and a variable walking height controller to enable bipedal robots to safely explore height-constrained environments. A vertically actuated Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (vSLIP) model is introduced to capture the robot coupled dynamics of planar walking and vertical walking height. This reduced-order model is utilized to optimize for long-term and short-term safe trajectory plans. A variable walking height controller is leveraged to enable the bipedal robot to maintain stable periodic walking gaits while following the planned trajectory. The entire framework is tested and experimentally validated using a bipedal robot Cassie. This demonstrates reliable autonomy to drive the robot to safely avoid obstacles while walking to the goal location in various kinds of height-constrained cluttered environments.

**Abstract:** In online algorithm selection (OAS), instances of an algorithmic problem class are presented to an agent one after another, and the agent has to quickly select a presumably best algorithm from a fixed set of candidate algorithms. For decision problems such as satisfiability (SAT), quality typically refers to the algorithm's runtime. As the latter is known to exhibit a heavy-tail distribution, an algorithm is normally stopped when exceeding a predefined upper time limit. As a consequence, machine learning methods used to optimize an algorithm selection strategy in a data-driven manner need to deal with right-censored samples, a problem that has received little attention in the literature so far. In this work, we revisit multi-armed bandit algorithms for OAS and discuss their capability of dealing with the problem. Moreover, we adapt them towards runtime-oriented losses, allowing for partially censored data while keeping a space- and time-complexity independent of the time horizon. In an extensive experimental evaluation on an adapted version of the ASlib benchmark, we demonstrate that theoretically well-founded methods based on Thompson sampling perform specifically strong and improve in comparison to existing methods.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to a different unlabeled target domain. Most existing UDA methods focus on learning domain-invariant feature representation, either from the domain level or category level, using convolution neural networks (CNNs)-based frameworks. One fundamental problem for the category level based UDA is the production of pseudo labels for samples in target domain, which are usually too noisy for accurate domain alignment, inevitably compromising the UDA performance. With the success of Transformer in various tasks, we find that the cross-attention in Transformer is robust to the noisy input pairs for better feature alignment, thus in this paper Transformer is adopted for the challenging UDA task. Specifically, to generate accurate input pairs, we design a two-way center-aware labeling algorithm to produce pseudo labels for target samples. Along with the pseudo labels, a weight-sharing triple-branch transformer framework is proposed to apply self-attention and cross-attention for source/target feature learning and source-target domain alignment, respectively. Such design explicitly enforces the framework to learn discriminative domain-specific and domain-invariant representations simultaneously. The proposed method is dubbed CDTrans (cross-domain transformer), and it provides one of the first attempts to solve UDA tasks with a pure transformer solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves the best performance on public UDA datasets, e.g. VisDA-2017 and DomainNet. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CDTrans/CDTrans.

**Abstract:** By the age of two, children tend to assume that new word categories are based on objects' shape, rather than their color or texture; this assumption is called the shape bias. They are thought to learn this bias by observing that their caregiver's language is biased towards shape based categories. This presents a chicken and egg problem: if the shape bias must be present in the language in order for children to learn it, how did it arise in language in the first place? In this paper, we propose that communicative efficiency explains both how the shape bias emerged and why it persists across generations. We model this process with neural emergent language agents that learn to communicate about raw pixelated images. First, we show that the shape bias emerges as a result of efficient communication strategies employed by agents. Second, we show that pressure brought on by communicative need is also necessary for it to persist across generations; simply having a shape bias in an agent's input language is insufficient. These results suggest that, over and above the operation of other learning strategies, the shape bias in human learners may emerge and be sustained by communicative pressures.

**Abstract:** Active Directory (AD) is a crucial element of large organizations, given its central role in managing access to resources. Since AD is used by all users in the organization, it is hard to detect attackers. We propose to generate and place fake users (honeyusers) in AD structures to help detect attacks. However, not any honeyuser will attract attackers. Our method generates honeyusers with a Variational Autoencoder that enriches the AD structure with well-positioned honeyusers. It first learns the embeddings of the original nodes and edges in the AD, then it uses a modified Bidirectional DAG-RNN to encode the parameters of the probability distribution of the latent space of node representations. Finally, it samples nodes from this distribution and uses an MLP to decide where the nodes are connected. The model was evaluated by the similarity of the generated AD with the original, by the positions of the new nodes, by the similarity with GraphRNN and finally by making real intruders attack the generated AD structure to see if they select the honeyusers. Results show that our machine learning model is good enough to generate well-placed honeyusers for existing AD structures so that intruders are lured into them.

**Abstract:** The learning trajectories of linguistic phenomena provide insight into the nature of linguistic representation, beyond what can be gleaned from inspecting the behavior of an adult speaker. To apply a similar approach to analyze neural language models (NLM), it is first necessary to establish that different models are similar enough in the generalizations they make. In this paper, we show that NLMs with different initialization, architecture, and training data acquire linguistic phenomena in a similar order, despite having different end performances over the data. Leveraging these findings, we compare the relative performance on different phenomena at varying learning stages with simpler reference models. Results suggest that NLMs exhibit consistent ``developmental'' stages. Initial analysis of these stages presents phenomena clusters (notably morphological ones), whose performance progresses in unison, suggesting potential links between their acquired representations.

**Abstract:** Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision. While approaches for axis-aligned bounding box detection have made substantial progress in recent years, they perform poorly on oriented objects which are common in several real-world scenarios such as aerial view imagery and security camera footage. In these cases, a large part of a predicted bounding box will, undesirably, cover non-object related areas. Therefore, oriented object detection has emerged with the aim of generalizing object detection to arbitrary orientations. This enables a tighter fit to oriented objects, leading to a better separation of bounding boxes especially in case of dense object distributions. The vast majority of the work in this area has focused on complex two-stage anchor-based approaches. Anchors act as priors on the bounding box shape and require attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a per-dataset basis, increased model size, and come with computational overhead. In this work, we present DAFNe: A Dense one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for oriented object detection. As a one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions on a dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler and faster, as well as easier to optimize than its two-stage counterparts. Furthermore, as an anchor-free model, DAFNe reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from employing bounding box anchors. Moreover, we introduce an orientation-aware generalization of the center-ness function for arbitrarily oriented bounding boxes to down-weight low-quality predictions and a center-to-corner bounding box prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. DAFNe improves the prediction accuracy over the previous best one-stage anchor-free model results on DOTA 1.0 by 4.65% mAP, setting the new state-of-the-art results by achieving 76.95% mAP.

**Abstract:** Capitalization and punctuation are important cues for comprehending written texts and conversational transcripts. Yet, many ASR systems do not produce punctuated and case-formatted speech transcripts. We propose to use a multi-task system that can exploit the relations between casing and punctuation to improve their prediction performance. Whereas text data for predicting punctuation and truecasing is seemingly abundant, we argue that written text resources are inadequate as training data for conversational models. We quantify the mismatch between written and conversational text domains by comparing the joint distributions of punctuation and word cases, and by testing our model cross-domain. Further, we show that by training the model in the written text domain and then transfer learning to conversations, we can achieve reasonable performance with less data.

**Abstract:** Skeleton-based action recognition models have recently been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Compared to adversarial attacks on images, perturbations to skeletons are typically bounded to a lower dimension of approximately 100 per frame. This lower-dimensional setting makes it more difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations. Existing attacks resolve this by exploiting the temporal structure of the skeleton motion so that the perturbation dimension increases to thousands. In this paper, we show that adversarial attacks can be performed on skeleton-based action recognition models, even in a significantly low-dimensional setting without any temporal manipulation. Specifically, we restrict the perturbations to the lengths of the skeleton's bones, which allows an adversary to manipulate only approximately 30 effective dimensions. We conducted experiments on the NTU RGB+D and HDM05 datasets and demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully deceived models with sometimes greater than 90\% success rate by small perturbations. Furthermore, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: in our low-dimensional setting, the adversarial training with the bone length attack shares a similar property with data augmentation, and it not only improves the adversarial robustness but also improves the classification accuracy on the original original data. This is an interesting counterexample of the trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which has been widely observed in studies on adversarial training in the high-dimensional regime.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptation, which involves transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, can be used to substantially reduce annotation costs in the field of object detection. In this study, we demonstrate that adversarial training in the source domain can be employed as a new approach for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we establish that adversarially trained detectors achieve improved detection performance in target domains that are significantly shifted from source domains. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that adversarially trained detectors can be used to extract robust features that are in alignment with human perception and worth transferring across domains while discarding domain-specific non-robust features. In addition, we propose a method that combines adversarial training and feature alignment to ensure the improved alignment of robust features with the target domain. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach on large domain shifts from real to artistic images. Compared to the baseline models, the adversarially trained detectors improve the mean average precision by up to 7.7%, and further by up to 11.8% when feature alignments are incorporated. Although our method degrades performance for small domain shifts, quantification of the domain shift based on the Frechet distance allows us to determine whether adversarial training should be conducted.

**Abstract:** For machine learning models trained with limited labeled training data, validation stands to become the main bottleneck to reducing overall annotation costs. We propose a statistical validation algorithm that accurately estimates the F-score of binary classifiers for rare categories, where finding relevant examples to evaluate on is particularly challenging. Our key insight is that simultaneous calibration and importance sampling enables accurate estimates even in the low-sample regime (< 300 samples). Critically, we also derive an accurate single-trial estimator of the variance of our method and demonstrate that this estimator is empirically accurate at low sample counts, enabling a practitioner to know how well they can trust a given low-sample estimate. When validating state-of-the-art semi-supervised models on ImageNet and iNaturalist2017, our method achieves the same estimates of model performance with up to 10x fewer labels than competing approaches. In particular, we can estimate model F1 scores with a variance of 0.005 using as few as 100 labels.

**Abstract:** Automatic annotation of short-text data to a large number of target labels, referred to as Short Text Extreme Classification, has recently found numerous applications in prediction of related searches and product recommendation tasks. The conventional usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture n-grams in text-classification relies heavily on uniformity in word-ordering and the presence of long input sequences to convolve over. However, this is missing in short and unstructured text sequences encountered in search and recommendation. In order to tackle this, we propose an orthogonal approach by recasting the convolution operation to capture coupled semantics along the embedding dimensions, and develop a word-order agnostic embedding enhancement module to deal with the lack of structure in such queries. Benefitting from the computational efficiency of the convolution operation, Embedding Convolutions, when applied on the enriched word embeddings, result in a light-weight and yet powerful encoder (InceptionXML) that is robust to the inherent lack of structure in short-text extreme classification.
  Towards scaling our model to problems with millions of labels, we also propose InceptionXML+, which addresses the shortcomings of the dynamic hard-negative mining framework in the recently proposed LightXML by improving the alignment between the label-shortlister and extreme classifier. On popular benchmark datasets, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep extreme classifiers such as Astec by an average of 5% and 8% on the P@k and propensity-scored PSP@k metrics respectively.

**Abstract:** Despite strong performance in many sequence-to-sequence tasks, autoregressive models trained with maximum likelihood estimation suffer from exposure bias, i.e. a discrepancy between the ground-truth prefixes used during training and the model-generated prefixes used at inference time. Scheduled sampling is a simple and often empirically successful approach which addresses this issue by incorporating model-generated prefixes into the training process. However, it has been argued that it is an inconsistent training objective leading to models ignoring the prefixes altogether. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments and find that it ameliorates exposure bias by increasing model reliance on the input sequence. We also observe that as a side-effect, it worsens performance when the model-generated prefix is correct, a form of catastrophic forgetting. We propose using Elastic Weight Consolidation as trade-off between mitigating exposure bias and retaining output quality. Experiments on two IWSLT'14 translation tasks demonstrate that our approach alleviates catastrophic forgetting and significantly improves BLEU compared to standard scheduled sampling.

**Abstract:** The development of over-parameterized pre-trained language models has made a significant contribution toward the success of natural language processing. While over-parameterization of these models is the key to their generalization power, it makes them unsuitable for deployment on low-capacity devices. We push the limits of state-of-the-art Transformer-based pre-trained language model compression using Kronecker decomposition. We use this decomposition for compression of the embedding layer, all linear mappings in the multi-head attention, and the feed-forward network modules in the Transformer layer. We perform intermediate-layer knowledge distillation using the uncompressed model as the teacher to improve the performance of the compressed model. We present our KroneckerBERT, a compressed version of the BERT_BASE model obtained using this framework. We evaluate the performance of KroneckerBERT on well-known NLP benchmarks and show that for a high compression factor of 19 (5% of the size of the BERT_BASE model), our KroneckerBERT outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods on the GLUE. Our experiments indicate that the proposed model has promising out-of-distribution robustness and is superior to the state-of-the-art compression methods on SQuAD.

Within the field of NLP, there are various mono- and bilingual use cases where gender inclusive language is appropriate, if not preferred due to ambiguity or uncertainty in terms of the gender of referents. In this work, we present a rule-based and a neural approach to gender-neutral rewriting for English along with manually curated synthetic data (WinoBias+) and natural data (OpenSubtitles and Reddit) benchmarks. A detailed manual and automatic evaluation highlights how our NeuTral Rewriter, trained on data generated by the rule-based approach, obtains word error rates (WER) below 0.18% on synthetic, in-domain and out-domain test sets.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an efficient and generalizable framework based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-source remote sensing data joint classification. While recent methods are mostly based on multi-stream architectures, we use group convolution to construct equivalent network architectures efficiently within a single-stream network. We further adopt and improve dynamic grouping convolution (DGConv) to make group convolution hyperparameters, and thus the overall network architecture, learnable during network training. The proposed method therefore can theoretically adjust any modern CNN models to any multi-source remote sensing data set, and can potentially avoid sub-optimal solutions caused by manually decided architecture hyperparameters. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to ResNet and UNet, and the adjusted networks are verified on three very diverse benchmark data sets (i.e., Houston2018 data, Berlin data, and MUUFL data). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed single-stream CNNs, and in particular ResNet18-DGConv improves the state-of-the-art classification overall accuracy (OA) on HS-SAR Berlin data set from $62.23\%$ to $68.21\%$. In the experiments we have two interesting findings. First, using DGConv generally reduces test OA variance. Second, multi-stream is harmful to model performance if imposed to the first few layers, but becomes beneficial if applied to deeper layers. Altogether, the findings imply that multi-stream architecture, instead of being a strictly necessary component in deep learning models for multi-source remote sensing data, essentially plays the role of model regularizer. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yyyyangyi/Multi-source-RS-DGConv. We hope our work can inspire novel research in the future.

**Abstract:** Graph Attention Network (GAT) focuses on modelling simple undirected and single relational graph data only. This limits its ability to deal with more general and complex multi-relational graphs that contain entities with directed links of different labels (e.g., knowledge graphs). Therefore, directly applying GAT on multi-relational graphs leads to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose r-GAT, a relational graph attention network to learn multi-channel entity representations. Specifically, each channel corresponds to a latent semantic aspect of an entity. This enables us to aggregate neighborhood information for the current aspect using relation features. We further propose a query-aware attention mechanism for subsequent tasks to select useful aspects. Extensive experiments on link prediction and entity classification tasks show that our r-GAT can model multi-relational graphs effectively. Also, we show the interpretability of our approach by case study.

**Abstract:** Search engines answer users' queries by listing relevant items (e.g. documents, songs, products, web pages, ...). These engines rely on algorithms that learn to rank items so as to present an ordered list maximizing the probability that it contains relevant item. The main challenge in the design of learning-to-rank algorithms stems from the fact that queries often have different meanings for different users. In absence of any contextual information about the query, one often has to adhere to the {\it diversity} principle, i.e., to return a list covering the various possible topics or meanings of the query. To formalize this learning-to-rank problem, we propose a natural model where (i) items are categorized into topics, (ii) users find items relevant only if they match the topic of their query, and (iii) the engine is not aware of the topic of an arriving query, nor of the frequency at which queries related to various topics arrive, nor of the topic-dependent click-through-rates of the items. For this problem, we devise LDR (Learning Diverse Rankings), an algorithm that efficiently learns the optimal list based on users' feedback only. We show that after $T$ queries, the regret of LDR scales as $O((N-L)\log(T))$ where $N$ is the number of all items. We further establish that this scaling cannot be improved, i.e., LDR is order optimal. Finally, using numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data, we illustrate the superiority of LDR compared to existing learning-to-rank algorithms.

**Abstract:** Adversarial examples can deceive a deep neural network (DNN) by significantly altering its response with imperceptible perturbations, which poses new potential vulnerabilities as the growing ubiquity of DNNs. However, most of the existing adversarial examples cannot maintain the malicious functionality if we apply an affine transformation on the resultant examples, which is an important measurement to the robustness of adversarial attacks for the practical risks. To address this issue, we propose an affine-invariant adversarial attack which can consistently construct adversarial examples robust over a distribution of affine transformation. To further improve the efficiency, we propose to disentangle the affine transformation into rotations, translations, magnifications, and reformulate the transformation in polar space. Afterwards, we construct an affine-invariant gradient estimator by convolving the gradient at the original image with derived kernels, which can be integrated with any gradient-based attack methods. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet demonstrate that our method can consistently produce more robust adversarial examples under significant affine transformations, and as a byproduct, improve the transferability of adversarial examples compared with the alternative state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a tumor phenotype whose diagnosis largely impacts patient care in colorectal cancers (CRC), and is associated with response to immunotherapy in all solid tumors. Deep learning models detecting MSI tumors directly from H&E stained slides have shown promise in improving diagnosis of MSI patients. Prior deep learning models for MSI detection have relied on neural networks pretrained on ImageNet dataset, which does not contain any medical image. In this study, we leverage recent advances in self-supervised learning by training neural networks on histology images from the TCGA dataset using MoCo V2. We show that these networks consistently outperform their counterparts pretrained using ImageNet and obtain state-of-the-art results for MSI detection with AUCs of 0.92 and 0.83 for CRC and gastric tumors, respectively. These models generalize well on an external CRC cohort (0.97 AUC on PAIP) and improve transfer from one organ to another. Finally we show that predictive image regions exhibit meaningful histological patterns, and that the use of MoCo features highlighted more relevant patterns according to an expert pathologist.

**Abstract:** A key trait of daily conversations between individuals is the ability to express empathy towards others, and exploring ways to implement empathy is a crucial step towards human-like dialogue systems. Previous approaches on this topic mainly focus on detecting and utilizing the user's emotion for generating empathetic responses. However, since empathy includes both aspects of affection and cognition, we argue that in addition to identifying the user's emotion, cognitive understanding of the user's situation should also be considered. To this end, we propose a novel approach for empathetic response generation, which leverages commonsense to draw more information about the user's situation and uses this additional information to further enhance the empathy expression in generated responses. We evaluate our approach on EmpatheticDialogues, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset for empathetic response generation. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline models in both automatic and human evaluations and can generate more informative and empathetic responses.

**Abstract:** The detection of fake news often requires sophisticated reasoning skills, such as logically combining information by considering word-level subtle clues. In this paper, we move towards fine-grained reasoning for fake news detection by better reflecting the logical processes of human thinking and enabling the modeling of subtle clues. In particular, we propose a fine-grained reasoning framework by following the human's information-processing model, introduce a mutual-reinforcement-based method for incorporating human knowledge about which evidence is more important, and design a prior-aware bi-channel kernel graph network to model subtle differences between pieces of evidence. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-art methods and demonstrate the explainability of our approach.

However, there is limited work that evaluates the choice of image preprocessing methods, the selection of NLP models, and the role of document layout. The impact of each element remains unknown. We evaluated this method on a use case of two key indicators for sleep apnea, Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) values, from scanned sleep study reports. Our data that included 955 manually annotated reports was secondarily utilized from a previous study in the University of Texas Medical Branch. We performed image preprocessing: gray-scaling followed by 1 iteration of dilating and erode, and 20% contrast increasing. The OCR was implemented with the Tesseract OCR engine. A total of seven Bag-of-Words models (Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest) and three deep learning-based models (BiLSTM, BERT, and Clinical BERT) were evaluated. We also evaluated the combinations of image preprocessing methods (gray-scaling, dilate & erode, increased contrast by 20%, increased contrast by 60%), and two deep learning architectures (with and without structured input that provides document layout information). Our proposed method using Clinical BERT reached an AUROC of 0.9743 and document accuracy of 94.76% for AHI, and an AUROC of 0.9523, and document accuracy of 91.61% for SaO2. We demonstrated the proper use of image preprocessing and document layout could be beneficial to scanned document processing.

**Abstract:** Autonomous driving (AD) systems have been thriving in recent years. In general, they receive sensor data, compute driving decisions, and output control signals to the vehicles. To smooth out the uncertainties brought by sensor inputs, AD systems usually leverage multi-sensor fusion (MSF) to fuse the sensor inputs and produce a more reliable understanding of the surroundings. However, MSF cannot completely eliminate the uncertainties since it lacks the knowledge about which sensor provides the most accurate data. As a result, critical consequences might happen unexpectedly. In this work, we observed that the popular MSF methods in an industry-grade Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) can mislead the car control and result in serious safety hazards. Misbehavior can happen regardless of the used fusion methods and the accurate data from at least one sensor. To attribute the safety hazards to a MSF method, we formally define the fusion errors and propose a way to distinguish safety violations causally induced by such errors. Further, we develop a novel evolutionary-based domain-specific search framework, FusionFuzz, for the efficient detection of fusion errors. We evaluate our framework on two widely used MSF methods. %in two driving environments. Experimental results show that FusionFuzz identifies more than 150 fusion errors. Finally, we provide several suggestions to improve the MSF methods under study.

**Abstract:** Recently, vehicle re-identification methods based on deep learning constitute remarkable achievement. However, this achievement requires large-scale and well-annotated datasets. In constructing the dataset, assigning globally available identities (Ids) to vehicles captured from a great number of cameras is labour-intensive, because it needs to consider their subtle appearance differences or viewpoint variations. In this paper, we propose camera-tracklet-aware contrastive learning (CTACL) using the multi-camera tracklet information without vehicle identity labels. The proposed CTACL divides an unlabelled domain, i.e., entire vehicle images, into multiple camera-level subdomains and conducts contrastive learning within and beyond the subdomains. The positive and negative samples for contrastive learning are defined using tracklet Ids of each camera. Additionally, the domain adaptation across camera networks is introduced to improve the generalisation performance of learnt representations and alleviate the performance degradation resulted from the domain gap between the subdomains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on video-based and image-based vehicle Re-ID datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art unsupervised vehicle Re-ID methods.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the contextual dynamic pricing problem where the market value of a product is linear in its observed features plus some market noise. Products are sold one at a time, and only a binary response indicating success or failure of a sale is observed. Our model setting is similar to Javanmard and Nazerzadeh [2019] except that we expand the demand curve to a semiparametric model and need to learn dynamically both parametric and nonparametric components. We propose a dynamic statistical learning and decision-making policy that combines semiparametric estimation from a generalized linear model with an unknown link and online decision-making to minimize regret (maximize revenue). Under mild conditions, we show that for a market noise c.d.f. $F(\cdot)$ with $m$-th order derivative ($m\geq 2$), our policy achieves a regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}_{d}(T^{\frac{2m+1}{4m-1}})$, where $T$ is time horizon and $\tilde{O}_{d}$ is the order that hides logarithmic terms and the dimensionality of feature $d$. The upper bound is further reduced to $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ if $F$ is super smooth whose Fourier transform decays exponentially. In terms of dependence on the horizon $T$, these upper bounds are close to $Œ©(\sqrt{T})$, the lower bound where $F$ belongs to a parametric class. We further generalize these results to the case with dynamically dependent product features under the strong mixing condition.

**Abstract:** In this work, we focus on a more challenging few-shot intent detection scenario where many intents are fine-grained and semantically similar. We present a simple yet effective few-shot intent detection schema via contrastive pre-training and fine-tuning. Specifically, we first conduct self-supervised contrastive pre-training on collected intent datasets, which implicitly learns to discriminate semantically similar utterances without using any labels. We then perform few-shot intent detection together with supervised contrastive learning, which explicitly pulls utterances from the same intent closer and pushes utterances across different intents farther. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging intent detection datasets under 5-shot and 10-shot settings.

**Abstract:** Importance sampling-based estimators for off-policy evaluation (OPE) are valued for their simplicity, unbiasedness, and reliance on relatively few assumptions. However, the variance of these estimators is often high, especially when trajectories are of different lengths. In this work, we introduce Omitting-States-Irrelevant-to-Return Importance Sampling (OSIRIS), an estimator which reduces variance by strategically omitting likelihood ratios associated with certain states. We formalize the conditions under which OSIRIS is unbiased and has lower variance than ordinary importance sampling, and we demonstrate these properties empirically.

**Abstract:** In this paper we explore the relation between distributionally robust learning and different forms of regularization to enforce robustness of deep neural networks. In particular, starting from a concrete min-max distributionally robust problem, and using tools from optimal transport theory, we derive first order and second order approximations to the distributionally robust problem in terms of appropriate regularized risk minimization problems. In the context of deep ResNet models, we identify the structure of the resulting regularization problems as mean-field optimal control problems where the number and dimension of state variables is within a dimension-free factor of the dimension of the original unrobust problem. Using the Pontryagin maximum principles associated to these problems we motivate a family of scalable algorithms for the training of robust neural networks. Our analysis recovers some results and algorithms known in the literature (in settings explained throughout the paper) and provides many other theoretical and algorithmic insights that to our knowledge are novel. In our analysis we employ tools that we deem useful for a future analysis of more general adversarial learning problems.

**Abstract:** Modern deep learning (DL) applications are built using DL libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. These frameworks have complex parameters and tuning them to obtain good training and inference performance is challenging for typical users, such as DL developers and data scientists. Manual tuning requires deep knowledge of the user-controllable parameters of DL frameworks as well as the underlying hardware. It is a slow and tedious process, and it typically delivers sub-optimal solutions.
  In this paper, we treat the problem of tuning parameters of DL frameworks to improve training and inference performance as a black-box optimization problem. We then investigate applicability and effectiveness of Bayesian optimization (BO), genetic algorithm (GA), and Nelder-Mead simplex (NMS) to tune the parameters of TensorFlow's CPU backend. While prior work has already investigated the use of Nelder-Mead simplex for a similar problem, it does not provide insights into the applicability of other more popular algorithms. Towards that end, we provide a systematic comparative analysis of all three algorithms in tuning TensorFlow's CPU backend on a variety of DL models. Our findings reveal that Bayesian optimization performs the best on the majority of models. There are, however, cases where it does not deliver the best results.

**Abstract:** An interesting observation in artificial neural networks is their favorable generalization error despite typically being extremely overparameterized. It is well known that the classical statistical learning methods often result in vacuous generalization errors in the case of overparameterized neural networks. Adopting the recently developed Neural Tangent (NT) kernel theory, we prove uniform generalization bounds for overparameterized neural networks in kernel regimes, when the true data generating model belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) corresponding to the NT kernel. Importantly, our bounds capture the exact error rates depending on the differentiability of the activation functions. In order to establish these bounds, we propose the information gain of the NT kernel as a measure of complexity of the learning problem. Our analysis uses a Mercer decomposition of the NT kernel in the basis of spherical harmonics and the decay rate of the corresponding eigenvalues. As a byproduct of our results, we show the equivalence between the RKHS corresponding to the NT kernel and its counterpart corresponding to the Mat√©rn family of kernels, showing the NT kernels induce a very general class of models. We further discuss the implications of our analysis for some recent results on the regret bounds for reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms, which use overparameterized neural networks.

<p>

**Abstract:** Verifying the veracity of claims requires reasoning over a large knowledge base, often in the form of corpora of trustworthy sources. A common approach consists in retrieving short portions of relevant text from the reference documents and giving them as input to a natural language inference module that determines whether the claim can be inferred or contradicted from them. This approach, however, struggles when multiple pieces of evidence need to be collected and combined from different documents, since the single documents are often barely related to the target claim and hence they are left out by the retrieval module. We conjecture that a graph-based approach can be beneficial to identify fragmented evidence. We tested this hypothesis by building, over the whole corpus, a large graph that interconnects text portions by means of mentioned entities and exploiting such a graph for identifying candidate sets of evidence from multiple sources. Our experiments show that leveraging on a graph structure is beneficial in identifying a reasonably small portion of passages related to a claim.

<p>

**Abstract:** Most of the recent works on probing representations have focused on BERT, with the presumption that the findings might be similar to the other models. In this work, we extend the probing studies to two other models in the family, namely ELECTRA and XLNet, showing that variations in the pre-training objectives or architectural choices can result in different behaviors in encoding linguistic information in the representations. Most notably, we observe that ELECTRA tends to encode linguistic knowledge in the deeper layers, whereas XLNet instead concentrates that in the earlier layers. Also, the former model undergoes a slight change during fine-tuning, whereas the latter experiences significant adjustments. Moreover, we show that drawing conclusions based on the weight mixing evaluation strategy -- which is widely used in the context of layer-wise probing -- can be misleading given the norm disparity of the representations across different layers. Instead, we adopt an alternative information-theoretic probing with minimum description length, which has recently been proven to provide more reliable and informative results.

**Abstract:** Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$, a graph coloring problem involves finding a partition of the vertices into different independent sets. In this paper we present a new framework that combines a deep neural network with the best tools of classical metaheuristics for graph coloring. The proposed method is evaluated on two popular graph coloring problems (vertex coloring and weighted coloring). Computational experiments on well-known benchmark graphs show that the proposed approach is able to obtain highly competitive results for both problems. A study of the contribution of deep learning in the method highlights that it is possible to learn relevant patterns useful to obtain better solutions to graph coloring problems.

**Abstract:** To enhance low-light images to normally-exposed ones is highly ill-posed, namely that the mapping relationship between them is one-to-many. Previous works based on the pixel-wise reconstruction losses and deterministic processes fail to capture the complex conditional distribution of normally exposed images, which results in improper brightness, residual noise, and artifacts. In this paper, we investigate to model this one-to-many relationship via a proposed normalizing flow model. An invertible network that takes the low-light images/features as the condition and learns to map the distribution of normally exposed images into a Gaussian distribution. In this way, the conditional distribution of the normally exposed images can be well modeled, and the enhancement process, i.e., the other inference direction of the invertible network, is equivalent to being constrained by a loss function that better describes the manifold structure of natural images during the training. The experimental results on the existing benchmark datasets show our method achieves better quantitative and qualitative results, obtaining better-exposed illumination, less noise and artifact, and richer colors.

**Abstract:** Deep neural network image classifiers are known to be susceptible not only to adversarial examples created for them but even those created for others. This phenomenon poses a potential security risk in various black-box systems relying on image classifiers. The reason behind such transferability of adversarial examples is not yet fully understood and many studies have proposed training methods to obtain classifiers with low transferability. In this study, we address this problem from a novel perspective through investigating the contribution of the network architecture to transferability. Specifically, we propose an architecture searching framework that employs neuroevolution to evolve network architectures and the gradient misalignment loss to encourage networks to converge into dissimilar functions after training. Our experiments show that the proposed framework successfully discovers architectures that reduce transferability from four standard networks including ResNet and VGG, while maintaining a good accuracy on unperturbed images. In addition, the evolved networks trained with gradient misalignment exhibit significantly lower transferability compared to standard networks trained with gradient misalignment, which indicates that the network architecture plays an important role in reducing transferability. This study demonstrates that designing or exploring proper network architectures is a promising approach to tackle the transferability issue and train adversarially robust image classifiers.

**Abstract:** We present WeakSTIL, an interpretable two-stage weak label deep learning pipeline for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer tissue. The sTIL% score is a prognostic and predictive biomarker for many solid tumor types. However, due to the high labeling efforts and high intra- and interobserver variability within and between expert annotators, this biomarker is currently not used in routine clinical decision making. WeakSTIL compresses tiles of a WSI using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised learning on unlabeled histopathology data and learns to predict precise sTIL% scores for each tile in the tumor bed by using a multiple instance learning regressor that only requires a weak WSI-level label. By requiring only a weak label, we overcome the large annotation efforts required to train currently existing TIL detection methods. We show that WeakSTIL is at least as good as other TIL detection methods when predicting the WSI-level sTIL% score, reaching a coefficient of determination of $0.45\pm0.15$ when compared to scores generated by an expert pathologist, and an AUC of $0.89\pm0.05$ when treating it as the clinically interesting sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task. Additionally, we show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL are highly interpretable, which suggests that WeakSTIL pays attention to latent features related to the number of TILs and the tissue type. In the future, WeakSTIL may be used to provide consistent and interpretable sTIL% predictions to stratify breast cancer patients into targeted therapy arms.

**Abstract:** Multi-task learning (MTL) is an efficient way to improve the performance of related tasks by sharing knowledge. However, most existing MTL networks run on a single end and are not suitable for collaborative intelligence (CI) scenarios. In this work, we propose an MTL network with a deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, which allows operating under CI scenarios. We first propose a feature fusion based MTL network (FFMNet) for joint object detection and semantic segmentation. Compared with other MTL networks, FFMNet gets higher performance with fewer parameters. Then FFMNet is split into two parts, which run on a mobile device and an edge server respectively. The feature generated by the mobile device is transmitted through the wireless channel to the edge server. To reduce the transmission overhead of the intermediate feature, a deep JSCC network is designed. By combining two networks together, the whole model achieves 512x compression for the intermediate feature and a performance loss within 2% on both tasks. At last, by training with noise, the FFMNet with JSCC is robust to various channel conditions and outperforms the separate source and channel coding scheme.

**Abstract:** Automated machine learning (AutoML) usually involves several crucial components, such as Data Augmentation (DA) policy, Hyper-Parameter Optimization (HPO), and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Although many strategies have been developed for automating these components in separation, joint optimization of these components remains challenging due to the largely increased search dimension and the variant input types of each component. Meanwhile, conducting these components in a sequence often requires careful coordination by human experts and may lead to sub-optimal results. In parallel to this, the common practice of searching for the optimal architecture first and then retraining it before deployment in NAS often suffers from low performance correlation between the search and retraining stages. An end-to-end solution that integrates the AutoML components and returns a ready-to-use model at the end of the search is desirable. In view of these, we propose DHA, which achieves joint optimization of Data augmentation policy, Hyper-parameter and Architecture. Specifically, end-to-end NAS is achieved in a differentiable manner by optimizing a compressed lower-dimensional feature space, while DA policy and HPO are updated dynamically at the same time. Experiments show that DHA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on various datasets, especially 77.4\% accuracy on ImageNet with cell based search space, which is higher than current SOTA by 0.5\%. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to efficiently and jointly optimize DA policy, NAS, and HPO in an end-to-end manner without retraining.

We propose efficient query strategies in active learning to select unbiased and informative data samples of diverse feature representations. We demonstrate our proposed method reduces sampling bias, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and model calibration in an active learning setup with the query computation 11x faster than CoreSet and 26x faster than Bayesian active learning by disagreement. Our method yields well-calibrated models even with imbalanced datasets. We also evaluate robustness to dataset shift and out-of-distribution in active learning setup and demonstrate our proposed SCAL method outperforms high performing compute-intensive methods by a bigger margin (average 8.9% higher AUROC for out-of-distribution detection and average 7.2% lower ECE under dataset shift).

**Abstract:** Pooling is a simple but essential layer in modern deep CNN architectures for feature aggregation and extraction. Typical CNN design focuses on the conv layers and activation functions, while leaving the pooling layers with fewer options. We introduce the Learning Discrete Wavelet Pooling (LDW-Pooling) that can be applied universally to replace standard pooling operations to better extract features with improved accuracy and efficiency. Motivated from the wavelet theory, we adopt the low-pass (L) and high-pass (H) filters horizontally and vertically for pooling on a 2D feature map. Feature signals are decomposed into four (LL, LH, HL, HH) subbands to retain features better and avoid information dropping. The wavelet transform ensures features after pooling can be fully preserved and recovered. We next adopt an energy-based attention learning to fine-select crucial and representative features. LDW-Pooling is effective and efficient when compared with other state-of-the-art pooling techniques such as WaveletPooling and LiftPooling. Extensive experimental validation shows that LDW-Pooling can be applied to a wide range of standard CNN architectures and consistently outperform standard (max, mean, mixed, and stochastic) pooling operations.

While there are several studies that have quantified player performance in other sports, analyzing badminton data is remained untouched. In this paper, we introduce a badminton language to fully describe the process of the shot and propose a deep learning model composed of a novel short-term extractor and a long-term encoder for capturing a shot-by-shot sequence in a badminton rally by framing the problem as predicting a rally result. Our model incorporates an attention mechanism to enable the transparency of the action sequence to the rally result, which is essential for badminton experts to gain interpretable predictions. Experimental evaluation based on a real-world dataset demonstrates that our proposed model outperforms the strong baselines.

**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation requires a lot of training data, which necessitates costly annotation. There have been many studies on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from one domain to another, e.g., from computer graphics to real images. However, there is still a gap in accuracy between UDA and supervised training on native domain data. It is arguably attributable to class-level misalignment between the source and target domain data. To cope with this, we propose a method that applies adversarial training to align two feature distributions in the target domain. It uses a self-training framework to split the image into two regions (i.e., trusted and untrusted), which form two distributions to align in the feature space. We term this approach cross-region adaptation (CRA) to distinguish from the previous methods of aligning different domain distributions, which we call cross-domain adaptation (CDA). CRA can be applied after any CDA method. Experimental results show that this always improves the accuracy of the combined CDA method, having updated the state-of-the-art.

These machine learning methods are typically stand-alone models designed without consideration for the integration necessary for real-world application workflows. In this study, we take a machine learning and systems (MLSys) perspective to design a system for COVID-19 patient screening with the clinical workflow in mind. The COVID-Net system is comprised of the continuously evolving COVIDx dataset, COVID-Net deep neural network for COVID-19 patient detection, and COVID-Net S deep neural networks for disease severity scoring for COVID-19 positive patient cases. The deep neural networks within the COVID-Net system possess state-of-the-art performance, and are designed to be integrated within a user interface (UI) for clinical decision support with automatic report generation to assist clinicians in their treatment decisions.

**Abstract:** Text-based personality prediction by computational models is an emerging field with the potential to significantly improve on key weaknesses of survey-based personality assessment. We investigate 3848 profiles from Twitter with self-labeled Myers-Briggs personality traits (MBTI) - a framework closely related to the Five Factor Model of personality - to better understand how text-based digital traces from social engagement online can be used to predict user personality traits. We leverage BERT, a state-of-the-art NLP architecture based on deep learning, to analyze various sources of text that hold most predictive power for our task. We find that biographies, statuses, and liked tweets contain significant predictive power for all dimensions of the MBTI system. We discuss our findings and their implications for the validity of the MBTI and the lexical hypothesis, a foundational theory underlying the Five Factor Model that links language use and behavior. Our results hold optimistic implications for personality psychologists, computational linguists, and other social scientists aiming to predict personality from observational text data and explore the links between language and core behavioral traits.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we study a distributed learning problem constrained by constant communication bits. Specifically, we consider the distributed hypothesis testing (DHT) problem where two distributed nodes are constrained to transmit a constant number of bits to a central decoder. In such cases, we show that in order to achieve the optimal error exponents, it suffices to consider the empirical distributions of observed data sequences and encode them to the transmission bits. With such a coding strategy, we develop a geometric approach in the distribution spaces and characterize the optimal schemes. In particular, we show the optimal achievable error exponents and coding schemes for the following cases: (i) both nodes can transmit $\log_23$ bits; (ii) one of the nodes can transmit $1$ bit, and the other node is not constrained; (iii) the joint distribution of the nodes are conditionally independent given one hypothesis. Furthermore, we provide several numerical examples for illustrating the theoretical results. Our results provide theoretical guidance for designing practical distributed learning rules, and the developed approach also reveals new potentials for establishing error exponents for DHT with more general communication constraints.

**Abstract:** This paper summarizes our endeavors in the past few years in terms of explaining image classifiers, with the aim of including negative results and insights we have gained. The paper starts with describing the explainable neural network (XNN), which attempts to extract and visualize several high-level concepts purely from the deep network, without relying on human linguistic concepts. This helps users understand network classifications that are less intuitive and substantially improves user performance on a difficult fine-grained classification task of discriminating among different species of seagulls.
  Realizing that an important missing piece is a reliable heatmap visualization tool, we have developed I-GOS and iGOS++ utilizing integrated gradients to avoid local optima in heatmap generation, which improved the performance across all resolutions. During the development of those visualizations, we realized that for a significant number of images, the classifier has multiple different paths to reach a confident prediction. This has lead to our recent development of structured attention graphs (SAGs), an approach that utilizes beam search to locate multiple coarse heatmaps for a single image, and compactly visualizes a set of heatmaps by capturing how different combinations of image regions impact the confidence of a classifier.
  Through the research process, we have learned much about insights in building deep network explanations, the existence and frequency of multiple explanations, and various tricks of the trade that make explanations work. In this paper, we attempt to share those insights and opinions with the readers with the hope that some of them will be informative for future researchers on explainable deep learning.

**Abstract:** A critical aspect of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is the object detection stage, which is increasingly being performed with sensor fusion models: multimodal 3D object detection models which utilize both 2D RGB image data and 3D data from a LIDAR sensor as inputs. In this work, we perform the first study to analyze the robustness of a high-performance, open source sensor fusion model architecture towards adversarial attacks and challenge the popular belief that the use of additional sensors automatically mitigate the risk of adversarial attacks. We find that despite the use of a LIDAR sensor, the model is vulnerable to our purposefully crafted image-based adversarial attacks including disappearance, universal patch, and spoofing. After identifying the underlying reason, we explore some potential defenses and provide some recommendations for improved sensor fusion models.

**Abstract:** Most applications of deep learning techniques in medical imaging are supervised and require a large number of labeled data which is expensive and requires many hours of careful annotation by experts. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, physics driven domain specific transporter framework with an attention mechanism to identify relevant key points with applications in ultrasound imaging. The proposed framework identifies key points that provide a concise geometric representation highlighting regions with high structural variation in ultrasound videos. We incorporate physics driven domain specific information as a feature probability map and use the radon transform to highlight features in specific orientations. The proposed framework has been trained on130 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 113 Wrist ultrasound (WUS) videos and validated on 100 Lung ultrasound (LUS) videos and 58 Wrist ultrasound (WUS) videos acquired from multiple centers across the globe. Images from both datasets were independently assessed by experts to identify clinically relevant features such as A-lines, B-lines and pleura from LUS and radial metaphysis, radial epiphysis and carpal bones from WUS videos. The key points detected from both datasets showed high sensitivity (LUS = 99\% , WUS = 74\%) in detecting the image landmarks identified by experts. Also, on employing for classification of the given lung image into normal and abnormal classes, the proposed approach, even with no prior training, achieved an average accuracy of 97\% and an average F1-score of 95\% respectively on the task of co-classification with 3 fold cross-validation. With the purely unsupervised nature of the proposed approach, we expect the key point detection approach to increase the applicability of ultrasound in various examination performed in emergency and point of care.

**Abstract:** We track the lineage of tuples throughout their database lifetime. That is, we consider a scenario in which tuples (records) that are produced by a query may affect other tuple insertions into the DB, as part of a normal workflow. As time goes on, exact provenance explanations for such tuples become deeply nested, increasingly consuming space, and resulting in decreased clarity and readability. We present a novel approach for approximating lineage tracking, using a Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique; namely, word embedding. The basic idea is summarizing (and approximating) the lineage of each tuple via a small set of constant-size vectors (the number of vectors per-tuple is a hyperparameter). Therefore, our solution does not suffer from space complexity blow-up over time, and it "naturally ranks" explanations to the existence of a tuple. We devise an alternative and improved lineage tracking mechanism, that of keeping track of and querying lineage at the column level; thereby, we manage to better distinguish between the provenance features and the textual characteristics of a tuple. We integrate our lineage computations into the PostgreSQL system via an extension (ProvSQL) and extensive experiments exhibit useful results in terms of accuracy against exact, semiring-based, justifications, especially for the column-based (CV) method which exhibits high precision and high per-level recall. In the experiments, we focus on tuples with \textit{multiple generations} of tuples in their lifelong lineage and analyze them in terms of direct and distant lineage.

**Abstract:** We propose SLTD (`Sequential Learning-to-Defer') a framework for learning-to-defer pre-emptively to an expert in sequential decision-making settings. SLTD measures the likelihood of improving value of deferring now versus later based on the underlying uncertainty in dynamics. In particular, we focus on the non-stationarity in the dynamics to accurately learn the deferral policy. We demonstrate our pre-emptive deferral can identify regions where the current policy has a low probability of improving outcomes. SLTD outperforms existing non-sequential learning-to-defer baselines, whilst reducing overall uncertainty on multiple synthetic and real-world simulators with non-stationary dynamics. We further derive and decompose the propagated (long-term) uncertainty for interpretation by the domain expert to provide an indication of when the model's performance is reliable.

**Abstract:** Automatic methods to segment the vestibular schwannoma (VS) tumors and the cochlea from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are critical to VS treatment planning. Although supervised methods have achieved satisfactory performance in VS segmentation, they require full annotations by experts, which is laborious and time-consuming. In this work, we aim to tackle the VS and cochlea segmentation problem in an unsupervised domain adaptation setting. Our proposed method leverages both the image-level domain alignment to minimize the domain divergence and semi-supervised training to further boost the performance. Furthermore, we propose to fuse the labels predicted from multiple models via noisy label correction. Our results on the challenge validation leaderboard showed that our unsupervised method has achieved promising VS and cochlea segmentation performance with mean dice score of 0.8261 $\pm$ 0.0416; The mean dice value for the tumor is 0.8302 $\pm$ 0.0772. This is comparable to the weakly-supervised based method.

**Abstract:** Feature based local attribution methods are amongst the most prevalent in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literature. Going beyond standard correlation, recently, methods have been proposed that highlight what should be minimally sufficient to justify the classification of an input (viz. pertinent positives). While minimal sufficiency is an attractive property, the resulting explanations are often too sparse for a human to understand and evaluate the local behavior of the model, thus making it difficult to judge its overall quality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Path-Sufficient Explanations Method (PSEM) that outputs a sequence of sufficient explanations for a given input of strictly decreasing size (or value) -- from original input to a minimally sufficient explanation -- which can be thought to trace the local boundary of the model in a smooth manner, thus providing better intuition about the local model behavior for the specific input. We validate these claims, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with experiments that show the benefit of PSEM across all three modalities (image, tabular and text). A user study depicts the strength of the method in communicating the local behavior, where (many) users are able to correctly determine the prediction made by a model.

**Abstract:** Exponential tilting is a technique commonly used in fields such as statistics, probability, information theory, and optimization to create parametric distribution shifts. Despite its prevalence in related fields, tilting has not seen widespread use in machine learning. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring the use of tilting in risk minimization. We study a simple extension to ERM -- tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM) -- which uses exponential tilting to flexibly tune the impact of individual losses. The resulting framework has several useful properties: We show that TERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to enable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to a superquantile method. Our work makes rigorous connections between TERM and related objectives, such as Value-at-Risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We develop batch and stochastic first-order optimization methods for solving TERM, provide convergence guarantees for the solvers, and show that the framework can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can be used for a multitude of applications in machine learning, such as enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling class imbalance. Despite the straightforward modification TERM makes to traditional ERM objectives, we find that the framework can consistently outperform ERM and deliver competitive performance with state-of-the-art, problem-specific approaches.

**Abstract:** Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Prolonged conduction through the myocardium can occur with HF, and a device-driven approach, termed cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), can improve left ventricular (LV) myocardial conduction patterns. While a functional benefit of CRT has been demonstrated, a large proportion of HF patients (30-50%) receiving CRT do not show sufficient improvement. Moreover, identifying HF patients that would benefit from CRT prospectively remains a clinical challenge. Accordingly, strategies to effectively predict those HF patients that would derive a functional benefit from CRT holds great medical and socio-economic importance. Thus, we used machine learning methods of classifying HF patients, namely Cluster Analysis, Decision Trees, and Artificial neural networks, to develop predictive models of individual outcomes following CRT. Clinical, functional, and biomarker data were collected in HF patients before and following CRT. A prospective 6-month endpoint of a reduction in LV volume was defined as a CRT response. Using this approach (418 responders, 412 non-responders), each with 56 parameters, we could classify HF patients based on their response to CRT with more than 95% success. We have demonstrated that using machine learning approaches can identify HF patients with a high probability of a positive CRT response (95% accuracy), and of equal importance, identify those HF patients that would not derive a functional benefit from CRT. Developing this approach into a clinical algorithm to assist in clinical decision-making regarding the use of CRT in HF patients would potentially improve outcomes and reduce health care costs.

**Abstract:** Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel noninvasive imaging modality for visualization of retinal blood flow in the human retina. Using specific OCTA imaging biomarkers for the identification of pathologies, automated image segmentations of the blood vessels can improve subsequent analysis and diagnosis. We present a novel method for the vessel identification based on frequency representations of the image, in particular, using so-called Gabor filter banks. The algorithm is evaluated on an OCTA image data set from $10$ eyes acquired by a Cirrus HD-OCT device. The segmentation outcomes received very good qualitative visual evaluation feedback and coincide well with device-specific values concerning vessel density. Concerning locality our segmentations are even more reliable and accurate. Therefore, we suggest the computation of adaptive local vessel density maps that allow straightforward analysis of retinal blood flow.

**Abstract:** We investigate the problem of recovering a partially observed high-rank matrix whose columns obey a nonlinear structure such as a union of subspaces, an algebraic variety or grouped in clusters. The recovery problem is formulated as the rank minimization of a nonlinear feature map applied to the original matrix, which is then further approximated by a constrained non-convex optimization problem involving the Grassmann manifold. We propose two sets of algorithms, one arising from Riemannian optimization and the other as an alternating minimization scheme, both of which include first- and second-order variants.
  Both sets of algorithms have theoretical guarantees. In particular, for the alternating minimization, we establish global convergence and worst-case complexity bounds. Additionally, using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, we show that the alternating minimization converges to a unique limit point.
  We provide extensive numerical results for the recovery of union of subspaces and clustering under entry sampling and dense Gaussian sampling. Our methods are competitive with existing approaches and, in particular, high accuracy is achieved in the recovery using Riemannian second-order methods.

**Abstract:** Distribution inference, sometimes called property inference, infers statistical properties about a training set from access to a model trained on that data. Distribution inference attacks can pose serious risks when models are trained on private data, but are difficult to distinguish from the intrinsic purpose of statistical machine learning -- namely, to produce models that capture statistical properties about a distribution. Motivated by Yeom et al.'s membership inference framework, we propose a formal definition of distribution inference attacks that is general enough to describe a broad class of attacks distinguishing between possible training distributions. We show how our definition captures previous ratio-based property inference attacks as well as new kinds of attack including revealing the average node degree or clustering coefficient of a training graph. To understand distribution inference risks, we introduce a metric that quantifies observed leakage by relating it to the leakage that would occur if samples from the training distribution were provided directly to the adversary. We report on a series of experiments across a range of different distributions using both novel black-box attacks and improved versions of the state-of-the-art white-box attacks. Our results show that inexpensive attacks are often as effective as expensive meta-classifier attacks, and that there are surprising asymmetries in the effectiveness of attacks.

**Abstract:** Animals are able to imitate each others' behavior, despite their difference in biomechanics. In contrast, imitating the other similar robots is a much more challenging task in robotics. This problem is called cross domain imitation learning~(CDIL). In this paper, we consider CDIL on a class of similar robots. We tackle this problem by introducing an imitation learning algorithm based on invariant representation. We propose to learn invariant state and action representations, which aligns the behavior of multiple robots so that CDIL becomes possible. Compared with previous invariant representation learning methods for similar purpose, our method does not require human-labeled pairwise data for training. Instead, we use cycle-consistency and domain confusion to align the representation and increase its robustness. We test the algorithm on multiple robots in simulator and show that unseen new robot instances can be trained with existing expert demonstrations successfully. Qualitative results also demonstrate that the proposed method is able to learn similar representations for different robots with similar behaviors, which is essential for successful CDIL.

**Abstract:** Millimeter-wave cellular communication requires beamforming procedures that enable alignment of the transmitter and receiver beams as the user equipment (UE) moves. For efficient beam tracking it is advantageous to classify users according to their traffic and mobility patterns. Research to date has demonstrated efficient ways of machine learning based UE classification. Although different machine learning approaches have shown success, most of them are based on physical layer attributes of the received signal. This, however, imposes additional complexity and requires access to those lower layer signals. In this paper, we show that traditional supervised and even unsupervised machine learning methods can successfully be applied on higher layer channel measurement reports in order to perform UE classification, thereby reducing the complexity of the classification process.

**Abstract:** This work presents a fault-tolerant control scheme for sensory faults in robotic manipulators based on active inference. In the majority of existing schemes, a binary decision of whether a sensor is healthy (functional) or faulty is made based on measured data. The decision boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show promising results and directions for future work are discussed.

**Abstract:** A CNN-based interactive contrast enhancement algorithm, called IceNet, is proposed in this work, which enables a user to adjust image contrast easily according to his or her preference. Specifically, a user provides a parameter for controlling the global brightness and two types of scribbles to darken or brighten local regions in an image. Then, given these annotations, IceNet estimates a gamma map for the pixel-wise gamma correction. Finally, through color restoration, an enhanced image is obtained. The user may provide annotations iteratively to obtain a satisfactory image. IceNet is also capable of producing a personalized enhanced image automatically, which can serve as a basis for further adjustment if so desired. Moreover, to train IceNet effectively and reliably, we propose three differentiable losses. Extensive experiments show that IceNet can provide users with satisfactorily enhanced images.

**Abstract:** Counterfactual explanations focus on "actionable knowledge" to help end-users understand how a machine learning outcome could be changed to a more desirable outcome. For this purpose a counterfactual explainer needs to discover input dependencies that relate to outcome changes. Identifying the minimum subset of feature changes needed to action an output change in the decision is an interesting challenge for counterfactual explainers. The DisCERN algorithm introduced in this paper is a case-based counter-factual explainer. Here counterfactuals are formed by replacing feature values from a nearest unlike neighbour (NUN) until an actionable change is observed. We show how widely adopted feature relevance-based explainers (i.e. LIME, SHAP), can inform DisCERN to identify the minimum subset of "actionable features". We demonstrate our DisCERN algorithm on five datasets in a comparative study with the widely used optimisation-based counterfactual approach DiCE. Our results demonstrate that DisCERN is an effective strategy to minimise actionable changes necessary to create good counterfactual explanations.

**Abstract:** Nowadays, colleges and universities use predictive analytics in a variety of ways to increase student success rates. Despite the potentials for predictive analytics, there exist two major barriers to their adoption in higher education: (a) the lack of democratization in deployment, and (b) the potential to exacerbate inequalities. Education researchers and policymakers encounter numerous challenges in deploying predictive modeling in practice. These challenges present in different steps of modeling including data preparation, model development, and evaluation. Nevertheless, each of these steps can introduce additional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Most large-scale and nationally representative education data sets suffer from a significant number of incomplete responses from the research participants. Missing Values are the frequent latent causes behind many data analysis challenges. While many education-related studies addressed the challenges of missing data, little is known about the impact of handling missing values on the fairness of predictive outcomes in practice.
  In this paper, we set out to first assess the disparities in predictive modeling outcome for college-student success, then investigate the impact of imputation techniques on the model performance and fairness using a comprehensive set of common metrics. The comprehensive analysis of a real large-scale education dataset reveals key insights on the modeling disparity and how different imputation techniques fundamentally compare to one another in terms of their impact on the fairness of the student-success predictive outcome.

**Abstract:** Specified Certainty Classification (SCC) is a new paradigm for employing classifiers whose outputs carry uncertainties, typically in the form of Bayesian posterior probabilities. By allowing the classifier output to be less precise than one of a set of atomic decisions, SCC allows all decisions to achieve a specified level of certainty, as well as provides insights into classifier behavior by examining all decisions that are possible. Our primary illustration is read classification for reference-guided genome assembly, but we demonstrate the breadth of SCC by also analyzing COVID-19 vaccination data.

**Abstract:** The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in an "infodemic" that has encouraged the propagation of misinformation about COVID-19 and cure methods which, in turn, could negatively affect the adoption of recommended public health measures in the larger population. In this paper, we provide a new multimodal (consisting of images, text and temporal information) labeled dataset containing news articles and tweets on the COVID-19 vaccine. We collected 2,593 news articles from 80 publishers for one year between Feb 16th 2020 to May 8th 2021 and 24184 Twitter posts (collected between April 17th 2021 to May 8th 2021). We combine ratings from two news media ranking sites: Medias Bias Chart and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) to classify the news dataset into two levels of credibility: reliable and unreliable. The combination of two filters allows for higher precision of labeling. We also propose a stance detection mechanism to annotate tweets into three levels of credibility: reliable, unreliable and inconclusive. We provide several statistics as well as other analytics like, publisher distribution, publication date distribution, topic analysis, etc. We also provide a novel architecture that classifies the news data into misinformation or truth to provide a baseline performance for this dataset. We find that the proposed architecture has an F-Score of 0.919 and accuracy of 0.882 for fake news detection. Furthermore, we provide benchmark performance for misinformation detection on tweet dataset. This new multimodal dataset can be used in research on COVID-19 vaccine, including misinformation detection, influence of fake COVID-19 vaccine information, etc.

**Abstract:** Self-driving cars and trucks, autonomous vehicles (AVs), should not be accepted by regulatory bodies and the public until they have much higher confidence in their safety and reliability -- which can most practically and convincingly be achieved by testing. But existing testing methods are inadequate for checking the end-to-end behaviors of AV controllers against complex, real-world corner cases involving interactions with multiple independent agents such as pedestrians and human-driven vehicles. While test-driving AVs on streets and highways fails to capture many rare events, existing simulation-based testing methods mainly focus on simple scenarios and do not scale well for complex driving situations that require sophisticated awareness of the surroundings. To address these limitations, we propose a new fuzz testing technique, called AutoFuzz, which can leverage widely-used AV simulators' API grammars. To generate semantically and temporally valid complex driving scenarios (sequences of scenes). AutoFuzz is guided by a constrained Neural Network (NN) evolutionary search over the API grammar to generate scenarios seeking to find unique traffic violations. Evaluation of our prototype on one state-of-the-art learning-based controller, two rule-based controllers, and one industrial-grade controller shows that AutoFuzz efficiently finds hundreds of traffic violations in high-fidelity simulation environments. Further, fine-tuning the learning-based controller with the traffic violations found by AutoFuzz successfully reduced the traffic violations found in the new version of the AV controller software.

**Abstract:** We study the online influence maximization (OIM) problem in social networks, where in multiple rounds the learner repeatedly chooses seed nodes to generate cascades, observes the cascade feedback, and gradually learns the best seeds that generate the largest cascade. We focus on two major challenges in this paper. First, we work with node-level feedback instead of edge-level feedback. The edge-level feedback reveals all edges that pass through information in a cascade, where the node-level feedback only reveals the activated nodes with timestamps. The node-level feedback is arguably more realistic since in practice it is relatively easy to observe who is influenced but very difficult to observe from which relationship (edge) the influence comes from. Second, we use standard offline oracle instead of offline pair-oracle. To compute a good seed set for the next round, an offline pair-oracle finds the best seed set and the best parameters within the confidence region simultaneously, and such an oracle is difficult to compute due to the combinatorial core of OIM problem. So we focus on how to use the standard offline influence maximization oracle which finds the best seed set given the edge parameters as input. In this paper, we resolve these challenges for the two most popular diffusion models, the independent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) model. For the IC model, the past research only achieves edge-level feedback, while we present the first $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm for the node-level feedback. Besides, the algorithm only invokes standard offline oracles. For the LT model, a recent study only provides an OIM solution that meets the first challenge but still requires a pair-oracle. In this paper, we apply a similar technique as in the IC model to replace the pair-oracle with a standard oracle while maintaining $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret.

**Abstract:** Selection bias is prevalent in the data for training and evaluating recommendation systems with explicit feedback. For example, users tend to rate items they like. However, when rating an item concerning a specific user, most of the recommendation algorithms tend to rely too much on his/her rating (feedback) history. This introduces implicit bias on the recommendation system, which is referred to as user feedback-loop bias in this paper. We propose a systematic and dynamic way to correct such bias and to obtain more diverse and objective recommendations by utilizing temporal rating information. Specifically, our method includes a deep-learning component to learn each user's dynamic rating history embedding for the estimation of the probability distribution of the items that the user rates sequentially. These estimated dynamic exposure probabilities are then used as propensity scores to train an inverse-propensity-scoring (IPS) rating predictor. We empirically validated the existence of such user feedback-loop bias in real world recommendation systems and compared the performance of our method with the baseline models that are either without de-biasing or with propensity scores estimated by other methods. The results show the superiority of our approach.

**Abstract:** Course selection is challenging for students in higher educational institutions. Existing course recommendation systems make relevant suggestions to the students and help them in exploring the available courses. The recommended courses can influence students' choice of degree program, future employment, and even their socioeconomic status. This paper focuses on identifying and alleviating biases that might be present in a course recommender system. We strive to promote balanced opportunities with our suggestions to all groups of students. At the same time, we need to make recommendations of good quality to all protected groups. We formulate our approach as a multi-objective optimization problem and study the trade-offs between equal opportunity and quality. We evaluate our methods using both real-world and synthetic datasets. The results indicate that we can considerably improve fairness regarding equality of opportunity, but we will introduce some quality loss. Out of the four methods we tested, GHC-Inc and GHC-Tabu are the best performing ones with different advantageous characteristics.

**Abstract:** Cardinality estimation (CardEst) plays a significant role in generating high-quality query plans for a query optimizer in DBMS. In the last decade, an increasing number of advanced CardEst methods (especially ML-based) have been proposed with outstanding estimation accuracy and inference latency. However, there exists no study that systematically evaluates the quality of these methods and answer the fundamental problem: to what extent can these methods improve the performance of query optimizer in real-world settings, which is the ultimate goal of a CardEst method. In this paper, we comprehensively and systematically compare the effectiveness of CardEst methods in a real DBMS. We establish a new benchmark for CardEst, which contains a new complex real-world dataset STATS and a diverse query workload STATS-CEB. We integrate multiple most representative CardEst methods into an open-source database system PostgreSQL, and comprehensively evaluate their true effectiveness in improving query plan quality, and other important aspects affecting their applicability, ranging from inference latency, model size, and training time, to update efficiency and accuracy. We obtain a number of key findings for the CardEst methods, under different data and query settings. Furthermore, we find that the widely used estimation accuracy metric(Q-Error) cannot distinguish the importance of different sub-plan queries during query optimization and thus cannot truly reflect the query plan quality generated by CardEst methods. Therefore, we propose a new metric P-Error to evaluate the performance of CardEst methods, which overcomes the limitation of Q-Error and is able to reflect the overall end-to-end performance of CardEst methods. We have made all of the benchmark data and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/Nathaniel-Han/End-to-End-CardEst-Benchmark.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the combination of multigrid methods and neural networks, starting from a Finite Element discretization of an elliptic PDE. Multigrid methods use interpolation operators to transfer information between different levels of approximation. These operators are crucial for fast convergence of multigrid, but they are generally unknown. We propose Deep Neural Network models for learning interpolation operators and we build a multilevel hierarchy based on the output of the network. We investigate the accuracy of the interpolation operator predicted by the Neural Network, testing it with different network architectures. This Neural Network approach for the construction of grid operators can then be extended for an automatic definition of multilevel solvers, allowing a portable solution in scientific computing

**Abstract:** Methods for time series prediction and classification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data have been treated separately so far. The recent emergence of attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) models boosted the interpretability of RNN parameters, making them appealing for the understanding of gene interactions. In this work, we generated synthetic time series gene expression data from a range of archetypal GRNs and we relied on a dual attention RNN to predict the gene temporal dynamics. We show that the prediction is extremely accurate for GRNs with different architectures. Next, we focused on the attention mechanism of the RNN and, using tools from graph theory, we found that its graph properties allow to hierarchically distinguish different architectures of the GRN. We show that the GRNs respond differently to the addition of noise in the prediction by the RNN and we relate the noise response to the analysis of the attention mechanism. In conclusion, this work provides a a way to understand and exploit the attention mechanism of RNN and it paves the way to RNN-based methods for time series prediction and inference of GRNs from gene expression data.

**Abstract:** Automated decision systems (ADS) have become ubiquitous in many high-stakes domains. Those systems typically involve sophisticated yet opaque artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that seldom allow for full comprehension of their inner workings, particularly for affected individuals. As a result, ADS are prone to deficient oversight and calibration, which can lead to undesirable (e.g., unfair) outcomes. In this work, we conduct an online study with 200 participants to examine people's perceptions of fairness and trustworthiness towards ADS in comparison to a scenario where a human instead of an ADS makes a high-stakes decision -- and we provide thorough identical explanations regarding decisions in both cases. Surprisingly, we find that people perceive ADS as fairer than human decision-makers. Our analyses also suggest that people's AI literacy affects their perceptions, indicating that people with higher AI literacy favor ADS more strongly over human decision-makers, whereas low-AI-literacy people exhibit no significant differences in their perceptions.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) system, where the UAV powers the mobile terminals by wireless power transfer (WPT) and provides computation service for them. We aim to maximize the computation rate of terminals while ensuring fairness among them. Considering the random trajectories of mobile terminals, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation (SAC-TR) algorithm, which combines off-policy and maximum entropy reinforcement learning to promote the convergence of the algorithm. We design the reward as a heterogeneous function of computation rate, fairness, and reaching of destination. Simulation results show that SAC-TR can quickly adapt to varying network environments and outperform representative benchmarks in a variety of situations.

**Abstract:** Fake news, false or misleading information presented as news, has a significant impact on many aspects of society, such as in politics or healthcare domains. Due to the deceiving nature of fake news, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the news content alone is insufficient. The multi-level social context information (news publishers and engaged users in social media) and temporal information of user engagement are important information in fake news detection. The proper usage of this information, however, introduces three chronic difficulties: 1) multi-level social context information is hard to be used without information loss, 2) temporal information is hard to be used along with multi-level social context information, 3) news representation with multi-level social context and temporal information is hard to be learned in an end-to-end manner. To overcome all three difficulties, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, Hetero-SCAN. We use Meta-Path to extract meaningful multi-level social context information without loss. Meta-Path, a composite relation connecting two node types, is proposed to capture the semantics in the heterogeneous graph. We then propose Meta-Path instance encoding and aggregation methods to capture the temporal information of user engagement and produce news representation end-to-end. According to our experiment, Hetero-SCAN yields significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art fake news detection methods.

**Abstract:** We extract and use player position time-series data, tagged along with the action types, to build a competent model for representing team tactics behavioral patterns and use this representation to predict the outcome of arbitrary movements. We provide a framework for the useful encoding of short tactics and space occupations in a more extended sequence of movements or tactical plans. We investigate game segments during a match in which the team in possession of the ball regularly attempts to reach a position where they can take a shot at goal for a single game. A carefully designed and efficient kernel is employed using a triangular fuzzy membership function to create multiple time series for players' potential of presence at different court regions. Unsupervised learning is then used for time series using triplet loss and deep neural networks with exponentially dilated causal convolutions for the derived multivariate time series. This works key contribution lies in its approach to model how short scenes contribute to other longer ones and how players occupies and creates new spaces in-game court. We discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach for prediction and recognition tasks on the professional basketball SportVU dataset for the 2015-16 half-season. The proposed system demonstrates descent functionality even with relatively small data.

**Abstract:** This study is concerned with few-shot segmentation, i.e., segmenting the region of an unseen object class in a query image, given support image(s) of its instances. The current methods rely on the pretrained CNN features of the support and query images. The key to good performance depends on the proper fusion of their mid-level and high-level features; the former contains shape-oriented information, while the latter has class-oriented information. Current state-of-the-art methods follow the approach of Tian et al., which gives the mid-level features the primary role and the high-level features the secondary role. In this paper, we reinterpret this widely employed approach by redifining the roles of the multi-level features; we swap the primary and secondary roles. Specifically, we regard that the current methods improve the initial estimate generated from the high-level features using the mid-level features. This reinterpretation suggests a new application of the current methods: to apply the same network multiple times to iteratively update the estimate of the object's region, starting from its initial estimate. Our experiments show that this method is effective and has updated the previous state-of-the-art on COCO-20$^i$ in the 1-shot and 5-shot settings and on PASCAL-5$^i$ in the 1-shot setting.

**Abstract:** The unprecedented success of deep learning (DL) makes it unchallenged when it comes to classification problems. However, it is well established that the current DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast literature on so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution to the problem. Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) -- despite the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable dimensions is a necessary condition for stability.
  Our result points towards the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however, no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.
