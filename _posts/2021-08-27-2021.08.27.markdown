**Abstract:** Generating a complex work of art such as a musical composition requires exhibiting true creativity that depends on a variety of factors that are related to the hierarchy of musical language. Music generation have been faced with Algorithmic methods and recently, with Deep Learning models that are being used in other fields such as Computer Vision. In this paper we want to put into context the existing relationships between AI-based music composition models and human musical composition and creativity processes. We give an overview of the recent Deep Learning models for music composition and we compare these models to the music composition process from a theoretical point of view. We have tried to answer some of the most relevant open questions for this task by analyzing the ability of current Deep Learning models to generate music with creativity or the similarity between AI and human composition processes, among others.

**Abstract:** We demonstrate a library for the integration of domain knowledge in deep learning architectures. Using this library, the structure of the data is expressed symbolically via graph declarations and the logical constraints over outputs or latent variables can be seamlessly added to the deep models. The domain knowledge can be defined explicitly, which improves the models' explainability in addition to the performance and generalizability in the low-data regime. Several approaches for such an integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic models have been introduced; however, there is no library to facilitate the programming for such an integration in a generic way while various underlying algorithms can be used. Our library aims to simplify programming for such an integration in both training and inference phases while separating the knowledge representation from learning algorithms. We showcase various NLP benchmark tasks and beyond. The framework is publicly available at Github(https://github.com/HLR/DomiKnowS).

**Abstract:** Automatic construction of relevant Knowledge Bases (KBs) from text, and generation of semantically meaningful text from KBs are both long-standing goals in Machine Learning. In this paper, we present ReGen, a bidirectional generation of text and graph leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve performance. Graph linearization enables us to re-frame both tasks as a sequence to sequence generation problem regardless of the generative direction, which in turn allows the use of Reinforcement Learning for sequence training where the model itself is employed as its own critic leading to Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST). We present an extensive investigation demonstrating that the use of RL via SCST benefits graph and text generation on WebNLG+ 2020 and TekGen datasets. Our system provides state-of-the-art results on WebNLG+ 2020 by significantly improving upon published results from the WebNLG 2020+ Challenge for both text-to-graph and graph-to-text generation tasks.

**Abstract:** Conformational sampling of biomolecules using molecular dynamics simulations often produces large amount of high dimensional data that makes it difficult to interpret using conventional analysis techniques. Dimensionality reduction methods are thus required to extract useful and relevant information. Here we devise a machine learning method, Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE) that can simultaneously perform dimensionality reduction and clustering of biomolecular conformations in an unsupervised way. We show that GMVAE can learn a reduced representation of the free energy landscape of protein folding with highly separated clusters that correspond to the metastable states during folding. Since GMVAE uses a mixture of Gaussians as the prior, it can directly acknowledge the multi-basin nature of protein folding free-energy landscape. To make the model end-to-end differentialble, we use a Gumbel-softmax distribution. We test the model on three long-timescale protein folding trajectories and show that GMVAE embedding resembles the folding funnel with folded states down the funnel and unfolded states outer in the funnel path. Additionally, we show that the latent space of GMVAE can be used for kinetic analysis and Markov state models built on this embedding produce folding and unfolding timescales that are in close agreement with other rigorous dynamical embeddings such as time independent component analysis (TICA).

**Abstract:** Event definitions in Complex Event Processing systems are constrained by the expressiveness of each system's language. Some systems allow the definition of instantaneous complex events, while others allow the definition of durative complex events. While there are exceptions that offer both options, they often lack of intervals relations such as those specified by the Allen's interval algebra. In this paper, we propose a new logic based temporal phenomena definition language, specifically tailored for Complex Event Processing, that allows the representation of both instantaneous and durative phenomena and the temporal relations between them. Moreover, we demonstrate the expressiveness of our proposed language by employing a maritime use case where we define maritime events of interest. Finally, we analyse the execution semantics of our proposed language for stream processing and introduce the `Phenesthe' implementation prototype.

<p>

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose QACE, a new metric based on Question Answering for Caption Evaluation. QACE generates questions on the evaluated caption and checks its content by asking the questions on either the reference caption or the source image. We first develop QACE-Ref that compares the answers of the evaluated caption to its reference, and report competitive results with the state-of-the-art metrics. To go further, we propose QACE-Img, which asks the questions directly on the image, instead of reference. A Visual-QA system is necessary for QACE-Img. Unfortunately, the standard VQA models are framed as a classification among only a few thousand categories. Instead, we propose Visual-T5, an abstractive VQA system. The resulting metric, QACE-Img is multi-modal, reference-less, and explainable. Our experiments show that QACE-Img compares favorably w.r.t. other reference-less metrics. We will release the pre-trained models to compute QACE.

**Abstract:** Purpose: To improve reconstruction fidelity of fine structures and textures in deep learning (DL) based reconstructions.
  Methods: A novel patch-based Unsupervised Feature Loss (UFLoss) is proposed and incorporated into the training of DL-based reconstruction frameworks in order to preserve perceptual similarity and high-order statistics. The UFLoss provides instance-level discrimination by mapping similar instances to similar low-dimensional feature vectors and is trained without any human annotation. By adding an additional loss function on the low-dimensional feature space during training, the reconstruction frameworks from under-sampled or corrupted data can reproduce more realistic images that are closer to the original with finer textures, sharper edges, and improved overall image quality. The performance of the proposed UFLoss is demonstrated on unrolled networks for accelerated 2D and 3D knee MRI reconstruction with retrospective under-sampling. Quantitative metrics including NRMSE, SSIM, and our proposed UFLoss were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with others.
  Results: In-vivo experiments indicate that adding the UFLoss encourages sharper edges and more faithful contrasts compared to traditional and learning-based methods with pure l2 loss. More detailed textures can be seen in both 2D and 3D knee MR images. Quantitative results indicate that reconstruction with UFLoss can provide comparable NRMSE and a higher SSIM while achieving a much lower UFLoss value.
  Conclusion: We present UFLoss, a patch-based unsupervised learned feature loss, which allows the training of DL-based reconstruction to obtain more detailed texture, finer features, and sharper edges with higher overall image quality under DL-based reconstruction frameworks.

**Abstract:** Spoken dialog systems need to be able to handle both multiple languages and multilinguality inside a conversation (\textit{e.g} in case of code-switching). In this work, we introduce new pretraining losses tailored to learn multilingual spoken dialog representations. The goal of these losses is to expose the model to code-switched language. To scale up training, we automatically build a pretraining corpus composed of multilingual conversations in five different languages (French, Italian, English, German and Spanish) from \texttt{OpenSubtitles}, a huge multilingual corpus composed of 24.3G tokens. We test the generic representations on \texttt{MIAM}, a new benchmark composed of five dialog act corpora on the same aforementioned languages as well as on two novel multilingual downstream tasks (\textit{i.e} multilingual mask utterance retrieval and multilingual inconsistency identification). Our experiments show that our new code switched-inspired losses achieve a better performance in both monolingual and multilingual settings.

<p>

**Abstract:** A new metric \texttt{BaryScore} to evaluate text generation based on deep contextualized embeddings e.g., BERT, Roberta, ELMo) is introduced. This metric is motivated by a new framework relying on optimal transport tools, i.e., Wasserstein distance and barycenter. By modelling the layer output of deep contextualized embeddings as a probability distribution rather than by a vector embedding; this framework provides a natural way to aggregate the different outputs through the Wasserstein space topology. In addition, it provides theoretical grounds to our metric and offers an alternative to available solutions e.g., MoverScore and BertScore). Numerical evaluation is performed on four different tasks: machine translation, summarization, data2text generation and image captioning. Our results show that \texttt{BaryScore} outperforms other BERT based metrics and exhibits more consistent behaviour in particular for text summarization.

**Abstract:** Understanding the semantic meaning of content on the web through the lens of entities and concepts has many practical advantages. However, when building large-scale entity extraction systems, practitioners are facing unique challenges involving finding the best ways to leverage the scale and variety of data available on internet platforms. We present learnings from our efforts in building an entity extraction system for multiple document types at large scale using multi-modal Transformers. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-lingual, multi-task and cross-document type learning. We also discuss the label collection schemes that help to minimize the amount of noise in the collected data.

**Abstract:** Blood cell detection in microscopic images is an essential branch of medical image processing research. Since disease detection based on manual checking of blood cells is time-consuming and full of errors, testing of blood cells using object detectors with Deep Convolutional Neural Network can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this work, an object detector based on YOLOF has been proposed to detect blood cell objects such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. This object detector is called TE-YOLOF, Tiny and Efficient YOLOF, and it is a One-Stage detector using dilated encoder to extract information from single-level feature maps. For increasing efficiency and flexibility, the EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network is utilized as the backbone for the proposed object detector. Furthermore, the Depthwise Separable Convolution is applied to enhance the performance and minimize the parameters of the network. In addition, the Mish activation function is employed to increase the precision. Extensive experiments on the BCCD dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, which is more efficient than other existing studies for blood cell detection.

**Abstract:** Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) can be used as the assistance of speech communication between pilots and air-traffic controllers. Its application can significantly reduce the complexity of the task and increase the reliability of transmitted information. Evidently, high accuracy predictions are needed to minimize the risk of errors. Especially, high accuracy is required in recognition of key information, such as commands and callsigns, used to navigate pilots. Our results prove that the surveillance data containing callsigns can help to considerably improve the recognition of a callsign in an utterance when the weights of probable callsign n-grams are reduced per utterance. In this paper, we investigate two approaches: (1) G-boosting, when callsigns weights are adjusted at language model level (G) and followed by the dynamic decoder with an on-the-fly composition, and (2) lattice rescoring when callsign information is introduced on top of lattices generated using a conventional decoder. Boosting callsign n-grams with the combination of two methods allowed us to gain 28.4% of absolute improvement in callsign recognition accuracy and up to 74.2% of relative improvement in WER of callsign recognition.

**Abstract:** A vast majority of the world's 7,000 spoken languages are predicted to become extinct within this century, including the endangered language of Ladin from the Italian Alps. Linguists who work to preserve a language's phonetic and phonological structure can spend hours transcribing each minute of speech from native speakers. To address this problem in the context of Ladin, our paper presents the first analysis of speech representations and machine learning models for classifying 32 phonemes of Ladin. We experimented with a novel dataset of the Fascian dialect of Ladin, collected from native speakers in Italy. We created frame-level and segment-level speech feature extraction approaches and conducted extensive experiments with 8 different classifiers trained on 9 different speech representations. Our speech representations ranged from traditional features (MFCC, LPC) to features learned with deep neural network models (autoencoders, LSTM autoencoders, and WaveNet). Our highest-performing classifier, trained on MFCC representations of speech signals, achieved an 86% average accuracy across all Ladin phonemes. We also obtained average accuracies above 77% for all Ladin phoneme subgroups examined. Our findings contribute insights for learning discriminative Ladin phoneme representations and demonstrate the potential for leveraging machine learning and speech signal processing to preserve Ladin and other endangered languages.

**Abstract:** When patients develop acute respiratory failure, accurately identifying the underlying etiology is essential for determining the best treatment, but it can be challenging to differentiate between common diagnoses in clinical practice. Machine learning models could improve medical diagnosis by augmenting clinical decision making and play a role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with acute respiratory failure. While machine learning models have been developed to identify common findings on chest radiographs (e.g. pneumonia), augmenting these approaches by also analyzing clinically relevant data from the electronic health record (EHR) could aid in the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. Machine learning models were trained to predict the cause of acute respiratory failure (pneumonia, heart failure, and/or COPD) using chest radiographs and EHR data from patients within an internal cohort using diagnoses based on physician chart review. Models were also tested on patients in an external cohort using discharge diagnosis codes. A model combining chest radiographs and EHR data outperformed models based on each modality alone for pneumonia and COPD. For pneumonia, the combined model AUROC was 0.79 (0.78-0.79), image model AUROC was 0.73 (0.72-0.75), and EHR model AUROC was 0.73 (0.70-0.76); for COPD, combined: 0.89 (0.83-0.91), image: 0.85 (0.77-0.89), and EHR: 0.80 (0.76-0.84); for heart failure, combined: 0.80 (0.77-0.84), image: 0.77 (0.71-0.81), and EHR: 0.80 (0.75-0.82). In the external cohort, performance was consistent for heart failure and COPD, but declined slightly for pneumonia. Overall, machine learning models combing chest radiographs and EHR data can accurately differentiate between common causes of acute respiratory failure. Further work is needed to determine whether these models could aid clinicians in the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure in clinical settings.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel framework for predicting the factuality of reporting of news media outlets by studying the user attention cycles in their YouTube channels. In particular, we design a rich set of features derived from the temporal evolution of the number of views, likes, dislikes, and comments for a video, which we then aggregate to the channel level. We develop and release a dataset for the task, containing observations of user attention on YouTube channels for 489 news media. Our experiments demonstrate both complementarity and sizable improvements over state-of-the-art textual representations.

**Abstract:** Facial detection and analysis systems have been deployed by large companies and critiqued by scholars and activists for the past decade. Critiques that focus on system performance analyze disparity of the system's output, i.e., how frequently is a face detected for different Fitzpatrick skin types or perceived genders. However, we focus on the robustness of these system outputs under noisy natural perturbations. We present the first of its kind detailed benchmark of the robustness of three such systems: Amazon Rekognition, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. We use both standard and recently released academic facial datasets to quantitatively analyze trends in robustness for each. Across all the datasets and systems, we generally find that photos of individuals who are older, masculine presenting, of darker skin type, or have dim lighting are more susceptible to errors than their counterparts in other identities.

**Abstract:** The prevalence of relation networks in computer vision is in stark contrast to underexplored point-based methods. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of local relation operators and survey their feasibility. We propose a scalable and efficient module, called group relation aggregator. The module computes a feature of a group based on the aggregation of the features of the inner-group points weighted by geometric relations and semantic relations. We adopt this module to design our RPNet. We further verify the expandability of RPNet, in terms of both depth and width, on the tasks of classification and segmentation. Surprisingly, empirical results show that wider RPNet fits for classification, while deeper RPNet works better on segmentation. RPNet achieves state-of-the-art for classification and segmentation on challenging benchmarks. We also compare our local aggregator with PointNet++, with around 30% parameters and 50% computation saving. Finally, we conduct experiments to reveal the robustness of RPNet with regard to rigid transformation and noises.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel method for pedestrian detection and tracking by fusing camera and LiDAR sensor data. To deal with the challenges associated with the autonomous driving scenarios, an integrated tracking and detection framework is proposed. The detection phase is performed by converting LiDAR streams to computationally tractable depth images, and then, a deep neural network is developed to identify pedestrian candidates both in RGB and depth images. To provide accurate information, the detection phase is further enhanced by fusing multi-modal sensor information using the Kalman filter. The tracking phase is a combination of the Kalman filter prediction and an optical flow algorithm to track multiple pedestrians in a scene. We evaluate our framework on a real public driving dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement over a baseline method that solely uses image-based pedestrian detection.

<p>

**Abstract:** Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) for air traffic control is generally trained by pooling both Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) and pilot data. In practice, this is motivated by the fact that the proportion of pilot data is lesser compared to ATCO while their standard language of communication is similar. However, due to data imbalance of ATCO and pilot and their varying acoustic conditions, the ASR performance is usually significantly better for ATCOs than pilots. In this paper, we propose to (1) split the ATCO and pilot data using an automatic approach exploiting ASR transcripts, and (2) consider ATCO and pilot ASR as two separate tasks for Acoustic Model (AM) training. For speaker role classification of ATCO and pilot data, a hypothesized ASR transcript is generated with a seed model, subsequently used to classify the speaker role based on the knowledge extracted from grammar defined by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This approach provides an average speaker role identification accuracy of 83% for ATCO and pilot. Finally, we show that training AMs separately for each task, or using a multitask approach is well suited for this data compared to AM trained by pooling all data.

<p>

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present our initial efforts for building a code-switching (CS) speech recognition system leveraging existing acoustic models (AMs) and language models (LMs), i.e., no training required, and specifically targeting intra-sentential switching. To achieve such an ambitious goal, new mechanisms for foreign pronunciation generation and language model (LM) enrichment have been devised. Specifically, we have designed an automatic approach to obtain high quality pronunciation of foreign language (FL) words in the native language (NL) phoneme set using existing acoustic phone decoders and an LSTM-based grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model. Improved accented pronunciations have thus been obtained by learning foreign pronunciations directly from data. Furthermore, a code-switching LM was deployed by converting the original NL LM into a CS LM using translated word pairs and borrowing statistics for the NL LM. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that our approach better deals with accented foreign pronunciations than techniques based on human labeling. Moreover, our best system achieves a 55.5% relative word error rate reduction from 34.4%, obtained with a conventional monolingual ASR system, to 15.3% on an intra-sentential CS task without harming the monolingual recognition accuracy.

**Abstract:** Structured prediction in natural language processing (NLP) has a long history. The complex models of structured application come at the difficulty of learning and inference. These difficulties lead researchers to focus more on models with simple structure components (e.g., local classifier). Deep representation learning has become increasingly popular in recent years. The structure components of their method, on the other hand, are usually relatively simple. We concentrate on complex structured models in this dissertation. We provide a learning framework for complicated structured models as well as an inference method with a better speed/accuracy/search error trade-off. The dissertation begins with a general introduction to energy-based models. In NLP and other applications, an energy function is comparable to the concept of a scoring function. In this dissertation, we discuss the concept of the energy function and structured models with different energy functions. Then, we propose a method in which we train a neural network to do argmax inference under a structured energy function, referring to the trained networks as "inference networks" or "energy-based inference networks". We then develop ways of jointly learning energy functions and inference networks using an adversarial learning framework. Despite the inference and learning difficulties of energy-based models, we present approaches in this thesis that enable energy-based models more easily to be applied in structured NLP applications.

**Abstract:** Automatic detection of prohibited items within complex and cluttered X-ray security imagery is essential to maintaining transport security, where prior work on automatic prohibited item detection focus primarily on pseudo-colour (rgb}) X-ray imagery. In this work we study the impact of variant X-ray imagery, i.e., X-ray energy response (high, low}) and effective-z compared to rgb, via the use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the joint object detection and segmentation task posed within X-ray baggage security screening. We evaluate state-of-the-art CNN architectures (Mask R-CNN, YOLACT, CARAFE and Cascade Mask R-CNN) to explore the transferability of models trained with such 'raw' variant imagery between the varying X-ray security scanners that exhibits differing imaging geometries, image resolutions and material colour profiles. Overall, we observe maximal detection performance using CARAFE, attributable to training using combination of rgb, high, low, and effective-z X-ray imagery, obtaining 0.7 mean Average Precision (mAP) for a six class object detection problem. Our results also exhibit a remarkable degree of generalisation capability in terms of cross-scanner transferability (AP: 0.835/0.611) for a one class object detection problem by combining rgb, high, low, and effective-z imagery.

**Abstract:** The commonly used latent space embedding techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, and manifold learning techniques, are typically used for learning effective representations of homogeneous data. However, they do not readily extend to heterogeneous data that are a combination of numerical and categorical variables, e.g., arising from linked GPS and text data. In this paper, we are interested in learning probabilistic generative models from high-dimensional heterogeneous data in an unsupervised fashion. The learned generative model provides latent unified representations that capture the factors common to the multiple dimensions of the data, and thus enable fusing multimodal data for various machine learning tasks. Following a Bayesian approach, we propose a general framework that combines disparate data types through the natural parameterization of the exponential family of distributions. To scale the model inference to millions of instances with thousands of features, we use the Laplace-Bernstein approximation for posterior computations involving nonlinear link functions. The proposed algorithm is presented in detail for the commonly encountered heterogeneous datasets with real-valued (Gaussian) and categorical (multinomial) features. Experiments on two high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets (NYC Taxi and MovieLens-10M) demonstrate the scalability and competitive performance of the proposed algorithm on different machine learning tasks such as anomaly detection, data imputation, and recommender systems.

**Abstract:** Reproducibility is a growing problem that has been extensively studied among computational researchers and within the signal processing and machine learning research community. However, with the changing landscape of signal processing and machine learning research come new obstacles and unseen challenges in creating reproducible experiments. Due to these new challenges most experiments have become difficult, if not impossible, to be reproduced by an independent researcher. In 2016 a survey conducted by the journal Nature found that 50% of researchers were unable to reproduce their own experiments. While the issue of reproducibility has been discussed in the literature and specifically within the signal processing community, it is still unclear to most researchers what are the best practices to ensure reproducibility without impinging on their primary responsibility of conducting research. We feel that although researchers understand the importance of making experiments reproducible, the lack of a clear set of standards and tools makes it difficult to incorporate good reproducibility practices in most labs. It is in this regard that we aim to present signal processing researchers with a set of practical tools and strategies that can help mitigate many of the obstacles to producing reproducible computational experiments.

**Abstract:** Predictive models for clinical outcomes that are accurate on average in a patient population may underperform drastically for some subpopulations, potentially introducing or reinforcing inequities in care access and quality. Model training approaches that aim to maximize worst-case model performance across subpopulations, such as distributionally robust optimization (DRO), attempt to address this problem without introducing additional harms. We conduct a large-scale empirical study of DRO and several variations of standard learning procedures to identify approaches for model development and selection that consistently improve disaggregated and worst-case performance over subpopulations compared to standard approaches for learning predictive models from electronic health records data. In the course of our evaluation, we introduce an extension to DRO approaches that allows for specification of the metric used to assess worst-case performance. We conduct the analysis for models that predict in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and 30-day readmission for inpatient admissions, and predict in-hospital mortality using intensive care data. We find that, with relatively few exceptions, no approach performs better, for each patient subpopulation examined, than standard learning procedures using the entire training dataset. These results imply that when it is of interest to improve model performance for patient subpopulations beyond what can be achieved with standard practices, it may be necessary to do so via techniques that implicitly or explicitly increase the effective sample size.

**Abstract:** The use of multi-modal data such as the combination of whole slide images (WSIs) and gene expression data for survival analysis can lead to more accurate survival predictions. Previous multi-modal survival models are not able to efficiently excavate the intrinsic information within each modality. Moreover, previous methods regard the information from different modalities as similarly important so they cannot flexibly utilize the potential connection between the modalities. To address the above problems, we propose a new asymmetrical multi-modal method, termed as AMMASurv. Different from previous works, AMMASurv can effectively utilize the intrinsic information within every modality and flexibly adapts to the modalities of different importance. Encouraging experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Despite the recent advances of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging, the automatic segmentation algorithms for kidneys in MRI exams are still scarce. Automated segmentation of kidneys in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exams are important for enabling radiomics and machine learning analysis of renal disease. In this work, we propose to use the popular Mask R-CNN for the automatic segmentation of kidneys in coronal T2-weighted Fast Spin Eco slices of 100 MRI exams. We propose the morphological operations as post-processing to further improve the performance of Mask R-CNN for this task. With 5-fold cross-validation data, the proposed Mask R-CNN is trained and validated on 70 and 10 MRI exams and then evaluated on the remaining 20 exams in each fold. Our proposed method achieved a dice score of 0.904 and IoU of 0.822.

**Abstract:** Deep learning-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art results in a number of applications including sentiment analysis, topic labelling, intent classification and others. Obtaining text representations or embeddings using these models presents the possibility of encoding personally identifiable information learned from language and context cues that may present a risk to reputation or privacy. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Context-Aware Private Embeddings (CAPE), a novel approach which preserves privacy during training of embeddings. To maintain the privacy of text representations, CAPE applies calibrated noise through differential privacy, preserving the encoded semantic links while obscuring sensitive information. In addition, CAPE employs an adversarial training regime that obscures identified private variables. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces private information leakage better than either single intervention.

**Abstract:** In the search for knowledge graph embeddings that could capture ontological knowledge, geometric models of existential rules have been recently introduced. It has been shown that convex geometric regions capture the so-called quasi-chained rules. Attributed description logics (DL) have been defined to bridge the gap between DL languages and knowledge graphs, whose facts often come with various kinds of annotations that may need to be taken into account for reasoning. In particular, temporally attributed DLs are enriched by specific attributes whose semantics allows for some temporal reasoning. Considering that geometric models and (temporally) attributed DLs are promising tools designed for knowledge graphs, this paper investigates their compatibility, focusing on the attributed version of a Horn dialect of the DL-Lite family. We first adapt the definition of geometric models to attributed DLs and show that every satisfiable ontology has a convex geometric model. Our second contribution is a study of the impact of temporal attributes. We show that a temporally attributed DL may not have a convex geometric model in general but we can recover geometric satisfiability by imposing some restrictions on the use of the temporal attributes.

**Abstract:** High-performance neural language models have obtained state-of-the-art results on a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, results for common benchmark datasets often do not reflect model reliability and robustness when applied to noisy, real-world data. In this study, we design and implement various types of character-level and word-level perturbation methods to simulate realistic scenarios in which input texts may be slightly noisy or different from the data distribution on which NLP systems were trained. Conducting comprehensive experiments on different NLP tasks, we investigate the ability of high-performance language models such as BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa, and ELMo in handling different types of input perturbations. The results suggest that language models are sensitive to input perturbations and their performance can decrease even when small changes are introduced. We highlight that models need to be further improved and that current benchmarks are not reflecting model robustness well. We argue that evaluations on perturbed inputs should routinely complement widely-used benchmarks in order to yield a more realistic understanding of NLP systems robustness.

**Abstract:** As the number of user equipments (UEs) with various data rate and latency requirements increases in wireless networks, the resource allocation problem for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) becomes challenging. In particular, varying requirements lead to a non-convex optimization problem when maximizing the systems data rate while preserving fairness between UEs. In this paper, we solve the non-convex optimization problem using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We outline, train and evaluate a DRL agent, which performs the task of media access control scheduling for a downlink OFDMA scenario. To kickstart training of our agent, we introduce mimicking learning. For improvement of scheduling performance, full buffer state information at the base station (e.g. packet age, packet size) is taken into account. Techniques like input feature compression, packet shuffling and age capping further improve the performance of the agent. We train and evaluate our agents using Nokia's wireless suite and evaluate against different benchmark agents. We show that our agents clearly outperform the benchmark agents.

**Abstract:** Along with the desire to address more complex problems, feature selection methods have gained in importance. Feature selection methods can be classified into wrapper method, filter method, and embedded method. Being a powerful embedded feature selection method, Lasso has attracted the attention of many researchers. However, as a linear approach, the applicability of Lasso has been limited. In this work, we propose LassoLayer that is one-to-one connected and trained by L1 optimization, which work to drop out unnecessary units for prediction. For nonlinear feature selections, we build LassoMLP: the network equipped with LassoLayer as its first layer. Because we can insert LassoLayer in any network structure, it can harness the strength of neural network suitable for tasks where feature selection is needed. We evaluate LassoMLP in feature selection with regression and classification tasks. LassoMLP receives features including considerable numbers of noisy factors that is harmful for overfitting. In the experiments using MNIST dataset, we confirm that LassoMLP outperforms the state-of-the-art method.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for industrial defect detection that is modeled based on anomaly detection using point pattern data. Most recent works use \textit{global features} for feature extraction to summarize image content. However, global features are not robust against lighting and viewpoint changes and do not describe the image's geometrical information to be fully utilized in the manufacturing industry. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose using transfer learning of local/point pattern features to overcome these limitations and capture geometrical information of the image regions. We model these local/point pattern features as a random finite set (RFS). In addition we propose RFS energy, in contrast to RFS likelihood as anomaly score. The similarity distribution of point pattern features of the normal sample has been modeled as a multivariate Gaussian. Parameters learning of the proposed RFS energy does not require any heavy computation. We evaluate the proposed approach on the MVTec AD dataset, a multi-object defect detection dataset. Experimental results show the outstanding performance of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and the proposed RFS energy outperforms the state-of-the-art in the few shot learning settings.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes the use of two task-aware warping factors in mask-based speech enhancement (SE). One controls the balance between speech-maintenance and noise-removal in training phases, while the other controls SE power applied to specific downstream tasks in testing phases. Our intention is to alleviate the problem that SE systems trained to improve speech quality often fail to improve other downstream tasks, such as automatic speaker verification (ASV) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), because they do not share the same objects. It is easy to apply the proposed dual-warping factors approach to any mask-based SE method, and it allows a single SE system to handle multiple tasks without task-dependent training. The effectiveness of our proposed approach has been confirmed on the SITW dataset for ASV evaluation and the LibriSpeech dataset for ASR and speech quality evaluations of 0-20dB. We show that different warping values are necessary for a single SE to achieve optimal performance w.r.t. the three tasks. With the use of task-dependent warping factors, speech quality was improved by an 84.7% PESQ increase, ASV had a 22.4% EER reduction, and ASR had a 52.2% WER reduction, on 0dB speech. The effectiveness of the task-dependent warping factors were also cross-validated on VoxCeleb-1 test set for ASV and LibriSpeech dev-clean set for ASV and quality evaluations. The proposed method is highly effective and easy to apply in practice.

**Abstract:** Vehicular object detection is the heart of any intelligent traffic system. It is essential for urban traffic management. R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and YOLO were some of the earlier state-of-the-art models. Region based CNN methods have the problem of higher inference time which makes it unrealistic to use the model in real-time. YOLO on the other hand struggles to detect small objects that appear in groups. In this paper, we propose a method that can locate and classify vehicular objects from a given densely crowded image using YOLOv5. The shortcoming of YOLO was solved my ensembling 4 different models. Our proposed model performs well on images taken from both top view and side view of the street in both day and night. The performance of our proposed model was measured on Dhaka AI dataset which contains densely crowded vehicular images. Our experiment shows that our model achieved mAP@0.5 of 0.458 with inference time of 0.75 sec which outperforms other state-of-the-art models on performance. Hence, the model can be implemented in the street for real-time traffic detection which can be used for traffic control and data collection.

**Abstract:** Peer reviewed publications are considered the gold standard in certifying and disseminating ideas that a research community considers valuable. However, we identify two major drawbacks of the current system: (1) the overwhelming demand for reviewers due to a large volume of submissions, and (2) the lack of incentives for reviewers to participate and expend the necessary effort to provide high-quality reviews. In this work, we adopt a mechanism-design approach to propose improvements to the peer review process. We present a two-stage mechanism which ties together the paper submission and review process, simultaneously incentivizing high-quality reviews and high-quality submissions. In the first stage, authors participate in a VCG auction for review slots by submitting their papers along with a bid that represents their expected value for having their paper reviewed. For the second stage, we propose a novel prediction market-style mechanism (H-DIPP) building on recent work in the information elicitation literature, which incentivizes participating reviewers to provide honest and effortful reviews. The revenue raised by the Stage I auction is used in Stage II to pay reviewers based on the quality of their reviews.

**Abstract:** Estimation of causal effects involves crucial assumptions about the data-generating process, such as directionality of effect, presence of instrumental variables or mediators, and whether all relevant confounders are observed. Violation of any of these assumptions leads to significant error in the effect estimate. However, unlike cross-validation for predictive models, there is no global validator method for a causal estimate. As a result, expressing different causal assumptions formally and validating them (to the extent possible) becomes critical for any analysis. We present DoWhy, a framework that allows explicit declaration of assumptions through a causal graph and provides multiple validation tests to check a subset of these assumptions. Our experience with DoWhy highlights a number of open questions for future research: developing new ways beyond causal graphs to express assumptions, the role of causal discovery in learning relevant parts of the graph, and developing validation tests that can better detect errors, both for average and conditional treatment effects. DoWhy is available at https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy.

**Abstract:** In order to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, intelligent robots need to carry out high-level, abstract planning and reasoning in conjunction with motion planning. However, abstract models are typically lossy and plans or policies computed using them can be inexecutable. These problems are exacerbated in stochastic situations where the robot needs to reason about and plan for multiple contingencies. We present a new approach for integrated task and motion planning in stochastic settings. In contrast to prior work in this direction, we show that our approach can effectively compute integrated task and motion policies whose branching structures encode agent behaviors that handle multiple execution-time contingencies. We prove that our algorithm is probabilistically complete and can compute feasible solution policies in an anytime fashion so that the probability of encountering an unresolved contingency decreases over time. Empirical results on a set of challenging problems show the utility and scope of our method.

**Abstract:** Creating virtual humans with embodied, human-like perceptual and actuation constraints has the promise to provide an integrated simulation platform for many scientific and engineering applications. We present Dynamic and Autonomous Simulated Human (DASH), an embodied virtual human that, given natural language commands, performs grasp-and-stack tasks in a physically-simulated cluttered environment solely using its own visual perception, proprioception, and touch, without requiring human motion data. By factoring the DASH system into a vision module, a language module, and manipulation modules of two skill categories, we can mix and match analytical and machine learning techniques for different modules so that DASH is able to not only perform randomly arranged tasks with a high success rate, but also do so under anthropomorphic constraints and with fluid and diverse motions. The modular design also favors analysis and extensibility to more complex manipulation skills.

**Abstract:** We study the Bayesian inverse problem of learning a linear operator on a Hilbert space from its noisy pointwise evaluations on random input data. Our framework assumes that this target operator is self-adjoint and diagonal in a basis shared with the Gaussian prior and noise covariance operators arising from the imposed statistical model and is able to handle target operators that are compact, bounded, or even unbounded. We establish posterior contraction rates with respect to a family of Bochner norms as the number of data tend to infinity and derive related lower bounds on the estimation error. In the large data limit, we also provide asymptotic convergence rates of suitably defined excess risk and generalization gap functionals associated with the posterior mean point estimator. In doing so, we connect the posterior consistency results to nonparametric learning theory. Furthermore, these convergence rates highlight and quantify the difficulty of learning unbounded linear operators in comparison with the learning of bounded or compact ones. Numerical experiments confirm the theory and demonstrate that similar conclusions may be expected in more general problem settings.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attack transferability is a well-recognized phenomenon in deep learning. Prior work has partially explained transferability by recognizing common adversarial subspaces and correlations between decision boundaries, but we have found little explanation in the literature beyond this. In this paper, we propose that transferability between seemingly different models is due to a high linear correlation between features that different deep neural networks extract. In other words, two models trained on the same task that are seemingly distant in the parameter space likely extract features in the same fashion, just with trivial shifts and rotations between the latent spaces. Furthermore, we show how applying a feature correlation loss, which decorrelates the extracted features in a latent space, can drastically reduce the transferability of adversarial attacks between models, suggesting that the models complete tasks in semantically different ways. Finally, we propose a Dual Neck Autoencoder (DNA), which leverages this feature correlation loss to create two meaningfully different encodings of input information with reduced transferability.

**Abstract:** With the growing pace of using machine learning to solve various problems, securing these models against adversaries has become one of the main concerns of researchers. Recent studies have shown that in an adversarial environment, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and adversaries can create carefully crafted inputs to fool the models. With the advent of deep neural networks, many researchers have used deep neural networks for various tasks, and have achieved impressive results. These models must become robust against attacks before being deployed safely, especially in security-related fields such as malware detection. In this paper, we first present a black-box source code-based adversarial malware generation approach that can be used to evaluate the robustness of malware detection models against real-world adversaries. The proposed approach injects adversarial codes into the various locations of malware source codes to evade malware detection models. We then propose Mal2GCN, a robust malware detection model. Mal2GCN uses the representation power of graph convolutional networks combined with the non-negative weights training method to create a malware detection model with high detection accuracy, which is also robust against adversarial attacks that add benign features to the input.

**Abstract:** A body of work has been done to automate machine learning algorithm to highlight the importance of model choice. Automating the process of choosing the best forecasting model and its corresponding parameters can result to improve a wide range of real-world applications. Bayesian optimisation (BO) uses a blackbox optimisation methods to propose solutions according to an exploration-exploitation trade-off criterion through acquisition functions. BO framework imposes two key ingredients: a probabilistic surrogate model that consist of prior belief of the unknown objective function(data-dependant) and an objective function that describes how optimal is the model-fit. Choosing the best model and its associated hyperparameters can be very expensive, and is typically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs) and at some extends applying approximate inference due its intractability. However, since GPs scale cubically with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose optimization requires many evaluations. In addition, most real-dataset are non-stationary which make idealistic assumptions on surrogate models. The necessity to solve the analytical tractability and the computational feasibility in a stochastic fashion enables to ensure the efficiency and the applicability of Bayesian optimisation. In this paper we explore the use of neural networks as an alternative to GPs to model distributions over functions, we provide a link between density-ratio estimation and class probability estimation based on approximate inference, this reformulation provides algorithm efficiency and tractability.

**Abstract:** Both NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the JAXA/NASA Hinode mission include spectropolarimetric instruments designed to measure the photospheric magnetic field. SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) emphasizes full-disk high-cadence and good spatial resolution data acquisition while Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT-SP) focuses on high spatial resolution and spectral sampling at the cost of a limited field of view and slower temporal cadence. This work introduces a deep-learning system named SynthIA (Synthetic Inversion Approximation), that can enhance both missions by capturing the best of each instrument's characteristics. We use SynthIA to produce a new magnetogram data product, SynodeP (Synthetic Hinode Pipeline), that mimics magnetograms from the higher spectral resolution Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline, but is derived from full-disk, high-cadence, and lower spectral-resolution SDO/HMI Stokes observations. Results on held-out data show that SynodeP has good agreement with the Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline inversions, including magnetic fill fraction, which is not provided by the current SDO/HMI pipeline. SynodeP further shows a reduction in the magnitude of the 24-hour oscillations present in the SDO/HMI data. To demonstrate SynthIA's generality, we show the use of SDO/AIA data and subsets of the HMI data as inputs, which enables trade-offs between fidelity to the Hinode/SOT-SP inversions, number of observations used, and temporal artifacts. We discuss possible generalizations of SynthIA and its implications for space weather modeling.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel hierarchical coding scheme for light fields based on transmittance patterns of low-rank multiplicative layers and Fourier disparity layers. The proposed scheme identifies multiplicative layers of light field view subsets optimized using a convolutional neural network for different scanning orders. Our approach exploits the hidden low-rank structure in the multiplicative layers obtained from the subsets of different scanning patterns. The spatial redundancies in the multiplicative layers can be efficiently removed by performing low-rank approximation at different ranks on the Krylov subspace. The intra-view and inter-view redundancies between approximated layers are further removed by HEVC encoding. Next, a Fourier disparity layer representation is constructed from the first subset of the approximated light field based on the chosen hierarchical order. Subsequent view subsets are synthesized by modeling the Fourier disparity layers that iteratively refine the representation with improved accuracy. The critical advantage of the proposed hybrid layered representation and coding scheme is that it utilizes not just spatial and temporal redundancies in light fields but efficiently exploits intrinsic similarities among neighboring sub-aperture images in both horizontal and vertical directions as specified by different predication orders. In addition, the scheme is flexible to realize a range of multiple bitrates at the decoder within a single integrated system. The compression performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed on real light fields. We achieved substantial bitrate savings and maintained good light field reconstruction quality.

**Abstract:** The problem of identifying regions of spatially interesting, different or adversarial behavior is inherent to many practical applications involving distributed multisensor systems. In this work, we develop a general framework stemming from multiple hypothesis testing to identify such regions. A discrete spatial grid is assumed for the monitored environment. The spatial grid points associated with different hypotheses are identified while controlling the false discovery rate at a pre-specified level. Measurements are acquired using a large-scale sensor network. We propose a novel, data-driven method to estimate local false discovery rates based on the spectral method of moments. Our method is agnostic to specific spatial propagation models of the underlying physical phenomenon. It relies on a broadly applicable density model for local summary statistics. In between sensors, locations are assigned to regions associated with different hypotheses based on interpolated local false discovery rates. The benefits of our method are illustrated by applications to spatially propagating radio waves.

**Abstract:** Transfer learning aims to learn classifiers for a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain. However, due to two main issues: feature discrepancy and distribution divergence, transfer learning can be a very difficult problem in practice. In this paper, we present a framework called TLF that builds a classifier for the target domain having only few labeled training records by transferring knowledge from the source domain having many labeled records. While existing methods often focus on one issue and leave the other one for the further work, TLF is capable of handling both issues simultaneously. In TLF, we alleviate feature discrepancy by identifying shared label distributions that act as the pivots to bridge the domains. We handle distribution divergence by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk functional, joint distributions between domains, and the manifold consistency underlying marginal distributions. Moreover, for the manifold consistency we exploit its intrinsic properties by identifying k nearest neighbors of a record, where the value of k is determined automatically in TLF. Furthermore, since negative transfer is not desired, we consider only the source records that are belonging to the source pivots during the knowledge transfer. We evaluate TLF on seven publicly available natural datasets and compare the performance of TLF against the performance of eleven state-of-the-art techniques. We also evaluate the effectiveness of TLF in some challenging situations. Our experimental results, including statistical sign test and Nemenyi test analyses, indicate a clear superiority of the proposed framework over the state-of-the-art techniques.

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are attracting increasing interest in the medical domain due to their ability to learn complicated tasks that require human intelligence and expert knowledge. AI systems that utilize high-performance Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of clinical text processing benchmarks. They have even outperformed human accuracy on some tasks. However, performance evaluation of such AI systems have been limited to accuracy measures on curated and clean benchmark datasets that may not properly reflect how robustly these systems can operate in real-world situations. In order to address this challenge, we introduce and implement a wide variety of perturbation methods that simulate different types of noise and variability in clinical text data. While noisy samples produced by these perturbation methods can often be understood by humans, they may cause AI systems to make erroneous decisions. Conducting extensive experiments on several clinical text processing tasks, we evaluated the robustness of high-performance NLP models against various types of character-level and word-level noise. The results revealed that the NLP models performance degrades when the input contains small amounts of noise. This study is a significant step towards exposing vulnerabilities of AI models utilized in clinical text processing systems. The proposed perturbation methods can be used in performance evaluation tests to assess how robustly clinical NLP models can operate on noisy data, in real-world settings.

**Abstract:** In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have made significant advances in pathology image segmentation. However, pathology image segmentation encounters with a dilemma in which the higher-performance networks generally require more computational resources and storage. This phenomenon limits the employment of high-accuracy networks in real scenes due to the inherent high-resolution of pathological images. To tackle this problem, we propose CoCo DistillNet, a novel Cross-layer Correlation (CoCo) knowledge distillation network for pathological gastric cancer segmentation. Knowledge distillation, a general technique which aims at improving the performance of a compact network through knowledge transfer from a cumbersome network. Concretely, our CoCo DistillNet models the correlations of channel-mixed spatial similarity between different layers and then transfers this knowledge from a pre-trained cumbersome teacher network to a non-trained compact student network. In addition, we also utilize the adversarial learning strategy to further prompt the distilling procedure which is called Adversarial Distillation (AD). Furthermore, to stabilize our training procedure, we make the use of the unsupervised Paraphraser Module (PM) to boost the knowledge paraphrase in the teacher network. As a result, extensive experiments conducted on the Gastric Cancer Segmentation Dataset demonstrate the prominent ability of CoCo DistillNet which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** We present a new quantum algorithm for estimating the mean of a real-valued random variable obtained as the output of a quantum computation. Our estimator achieves a nearly-optimal quadratic speedup over the number of classical i.i.d. samples needed to estimate the mean of a heavy-tailed distribution with a sub-Gaussian error rate. This result subsumes (up to logarithmic factors) earlier works on the mean estimation problem that were not optimal for heavy-tailed distributions [BHMT02,BDGT11], or that require prior information on the variance [Hein02,Mon15,HM19]. As an application, we obtain new quantum algorithms for the $(ε,δ)$-approximation problem with an optimal dependence on the coefficient of variation of the input random variable.

**Abstract:** In this study, the effects of surface roughness and pore characteristics on fatigue lives of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) Ti-6Al-4V parts were investigated. The 197 fatigue bars were printed using the same laser power but with varied scanning speeds. These actions led to variations in the geometries of microscale pores, and such variations were characterized using micro-computed tomography. To generate differences in surface roughness in fatigue bars, half of the samples were grit-blasted and the other half machined. Fatigue behaviors were analyzed with respect to surface roughness and statistics of the pores. For the grit-blasted samples, the contour laser scan in the LPBF strategy led to a pore-depletion zone isolating surface and internal pores with different features. For the machined samples, where surface pores resemble internal pores, the fatigue life was highly correlated with the average pore size and projected pore area in the plane perpendicular to the stress direction. Finally, a machine learning model using a drop-out neural network (DONN) was employed to establish a link between surface and pore features to the fatigue data (logN), and good prediction accuracy was demonstrated. Besides predicting fatigue lives, the DONN can also estimate the prediction uncertainty.

**Abstract:** Population-wide vaccination is critical for containing the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic when combined with restrictive and prevention measures. In this study, we introduce SAIVR, a mathematical model able to forecast the Covid-19 epidemic evolution during the vaccination campaign. SAIVR extends the widely used Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model by considering the Asymptomatic (A) and Vaccinated (V) compartments. The model contains several parameters and initial conditions that are estimated by employing a semi-supervised machine learning procedure. After training an unsupervised neural network to solve the SAIVR differential equations, a supervised framework then estimates the optimal conditions and parameters that best fit recent infectious curves of 27 countries. Instructed by these results, we performed an extensive study on the temporal evolution of the pandemic under varying values of roll-out daily rates, vaccine efficacy, and a broad range of societal vaccine hesitancy/denial levels. The concept of herd immunity is questioned by studying future scenarios which involve different vaccination efforts and more infectious Covid-19 variants.

**Abstract:** DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling are two techniques used in drug discovery to find small molecules that bind a protein target. Applying QSAR modeling to DEL data can facilitate the selection of compounds for off-DNA synthesis and evaluation. Such a combined approach has been shown recently by training binary classifiers to learn DEL enrichments of aggregated "disynthons" to accommodate the sparse and noisy nature of DEL data. However, a binary classifier cannot distinguish between different levels of enrichment, and information is potentially lost during disynthon aggregation. Here, we demonstrate a regression approach to learning DEL enrichments of individual molecules using a custom negative log-likelihood loss function that effectively denoises DEL data and introduces opportunities for visualization of learned structure-activity relationships (SAR). Our approach explicitly models the Poisson statistics of the sequencing process used in the DEL experimental workflow under a frequentist view. We illustrate this approach on a dataset of 108k compounds screened against CAIX, and a dataset of 5.7M compounds screened against sEH and SIRT2. Due to the treatment of uncertainty in the data through the negative log-likelihood loss function, the models can ignore low-confidence outliers. While our approach does not demonstrate a benefit for extrapolation to novel structures, we expect our denoising and visualization pipeline to be useful in identifying SAR trends and enriched pharmacophores in DEL data. Further, this approach to uncertainty-aware regression is applicable to other sparse or noisy datasets where the nature of stochasticity is known or can be modeled; in particular, the Poisson enrichment ratio metric we use can apply to other settings that compare sequencing count data between two experimental conditions.

**Abstract:** In the construction of reduced-order models for dynamical systems, linear projection methods, such as proper orthogonal decompositions, are commonly employed. However, for many dynamical systems, the lower dimensional representation of the state space can most accurately be described by a \textit{nonlinear} manifold. Previous research has shown that deep learning can provide an efficient method for performing nonlinear dimension reduction, though they are dependent on the availability of training data and are often problem-specific \citep[see][]{carlberg_ca}. Here, we utilize randomized training data to create and train convolutional autoencoders that perform nonlinear dimension reduction for the wave and Kuramoto-Shivasinsky equations. Moreover, we present training methods that are independent of full-order model samples and use the manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection method to define a reduced-order model for the heat, wave, and Kuramoto-Shivasinsky equations using the same autoencoder.

**Abstract:** Distributed dataflow systems like Spark and Flink enable the use of clusters for scalable data analytics. While runtime prediction models can be used to initially select appropriate cluster resources given target runtimes, the actual runtime performance of dataflow jobs depends on several factors and varies over time. Yet, in many situations, dynamic scaling can be used to meet formulated runtime targets despite significant performance variance.
  This paper presents Enel, a novel dynamic scaling approach that uses message propagation on an attributed graph to model dataflow jobs and, thus, allows for deriving effective rescaling decisions. For this, Enel incorporates descriptive properties that capture the respective execution context, considers statistics from individual dataflow tasks, and propagates predictions through the job graph to eventually find an optimized new scale-out. Our evaluation of Enel with four iterative Spark jobs shows that our approach is able to identify effective rescaling actions, reacting for instance to node failures, and can be reused across different execution contexts.

**Abstract:** Recommender systems typically operate on high-dimensional sparse user-item matrices. Matrix completion is a very challenging task to predict one's interest based on millions of other users having each seen a small subset of thousands of items. We propose a Global-Local Kernel-based matrix completion framework, named GLocal-K, that aims to generalise and represent a high-dimensional sparse user-item matrix entry into a low dimensional space with a small number of important features. Our GLocal-K can be divided into two major stages. First, we pre-train an auto encoder with the local kernelised weight matrix, which transforms the data from one space into the feature space by using a 2d-RBF kernel. Then, the pre-trained auto encoder is fine-tuned with the rating matrix, produced by a convolution-based global kernel, which captures the characteristics of each item. We apply our GLocal-K model under the extreme low-resource setting, which includes only a user-item rating matrix, with no side information. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on three collaborative filtering benchmarks: ML-100K, ML-1M, and Douban.

**Abstract:** Code generation is crucial to reduce manual software development efforts. Recently, neural techniques have been used to generate source code automatically. While promising, these approaches are evaluated on tasks for generating code in single programming languages. However, in actual development, one programming language is often embedded in another. For example, SQL statements are often embedded as strings in base programming languages such as Python and Java, and JavaScript programs are often embedded in sever-side programming languages, such as PHP, Java, and Python. We call this a turducken-style programming. In this paper, we define a new code generation task: given a natural language comment, this task aims to generate a program in a base language with an embedded language. To our knowledge, this is the first turducken-style code generation task. For this task, we present Lyra: a dataset in Python with embedded SQL. This dataset contains 2,000 carefully annotated database manipulation programs from real usage projects. Each program is paired with both a Chinese comment and an English comment. In our experiment, we adopted Transformer, a state-of-the-art technique, as the baseline. In the best setting, Transformer achieves 0.5% and 1.5% AST exact matching accuracy using Chinese and English comments, respectively. Therefore, we believe that Lyra provides a new challenge for code generation.

**Abstract:** This paper identifies and addresses dynamic selection problems that arise in online learning algorithms with endogenous data. In a contextual multi-armed bandit model, we show that a novel bias (self-fulfilling bias) arises because the endogeneity of the data influences the choices of decisions, affecting the distribution of future data to be collected and analyzed. We propose a class of algorithms to correct for the bias by incorporating instrumental variables into leading online learning algorithms. These algorithms lead to the true parameter values and meanwhile attain low (logarithmic-like) regret levels. We further prove a central limit theorem for statistical inference of the parameters of interest. To establish the theoretical properties, we develop a general technique that untangles the interdependence between data and actions.

**Abstract:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a simple network that has an input, an output, and numerous hidden layers with a set of nodes. Implementation of ANN algorithms in electrical, and electronics engineering always satisfies with the expected results as ANN handles binary data more accurately. Brushless Direct Current motor (BLDC motor) uses electronic closed-loop controllers to switch DC current to the motor windings and produces the magnetic fields. The BLDC motor finds various applications owing to its high speed, low maintenance and adequate torque capability. They are highly preferred than the other motors because of their better performance and it is easy to control their speed by Power Converters. This article presents a method of speed control of BLDC motors where speed is controlled by changing the DC input voltage of the bridge converter that feeds the motor winding. The control is done by using a PI based speed controller. The motor is modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink and the speed control is obtained with a PI controller. EMF signals, rotor speed, electromagnetic torque, Hall Effect signals, PWM and EMF signals simulations are then obtained. This acquired data is then fed into binary artificial neural networks and as a result, the ANN model predicts the corresponding parameters close to the simulation results. Both the mathematical based simulation and data based prediction gives satisfactory results
