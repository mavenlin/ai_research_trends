**Abstract:** Multiplying matrices is among the most fundamental and compute-intensive operations in machine learning. Consequently, there has been significant work on efficiently approximating matrix multiplies. We introduce a learning-based algorithm for this task that greatly outperforms existing methods. Experiments using hundreds of matrices from diverse domains show that it often runs $100\times$ faster than exact matrix products and $10\times$ faster than current approximate methods. In the common case that one matrix is known ahead of time, our method also has the interesting property that it requires zero multiply-adds. These results suggest that a mixture of hashing, averaging, and byte shuffling$-$the core operations of our method$-$could be a more promising building block for machine learning than the sparsified, factorized, and/or scalar quantized matrix products that have recently been the focus of substantial research and hardware investment.

**Abstract:** We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for, resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation, and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and its variants. Our network also reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous approaches.

<p>

**Abstract:** We present Graph Neural Diffusion (GRAND) that approaches deep learning on graphs as a continuous diffusion process and treats Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as discretisations of an underlying PDE. In our model, the layer structure and topology correspond to the discretisation choices of temporal and spatial operators. Our approach allows a principled development of a broad new class of GNNs that are able to address the common plights of graph learning models such as depth, oversmoothing, and bottlenecks. Key to the success of our models are stability with respect to perturbations in the data and this is addressed for both implicit and explicit discretisation schemes. We develop linear and nonlinear versions of GRAND, which achieve competitive results on many standard graph benchmarks.

<p>

**Abstract:** There has been a recent surge of interest in nonparametric bandit algorithms based on subsampling. One drawback however of these approaches is the additional complexity required by random subsampling and the storage of the full history of rewards. Our first contribution is to show that a simple deterministic subsampling rule, proposed in the recent work of Baudry et al. (2020) under the name of ''last-block subsampling'', is asymptotically optimal in one-parameter exponential families. In addition, we prove that these guarantees also hold when limiting the algorithm memory to a polylogarithmic function of the time horizon. These findings open up new perspectives, in particular for non-stationary scenarios in which the arm distributions evolve over time. We propose a variant of the algorithm in which only the most recent observations are used for subsampling, achieving optimal regret guarantees under the assumption of a known number of abrupt changes. Extensive numerical simulations highlight the merits of this approach, particularly when the changes are not only affecting the means of the rewards.

**Abstract:** Video understanding relies on perceiving the global content and modeling its internal connections (e.g., causality, movement, and spatio-temporal correspondence). To learn these interactions, we apply a mask-then-predict pre-training task on discretized video tokens generated via VQ-VAE. Unlike language, where the text tokens are more independent, neighboring video tokens typically have strong correlations (e.g., consecutive video frames usually look very similar), and hence uniformly masking individual tokens will make the task too trivial to learn useful representations. To deal with this issue, we propose a block-wise masking strategy where we mask neighboring video tokens in both spatial and temporal domains. We also add an augmentation-free contrastive learning method to further capture the global content by predicting whether the video clips are sampled from the same video. We pre-train our model on uncurated videos and show that our pre-trained model can reach state-of-the-art results on several video understanding datasets (e.g., SSV2, Diving48). Lastly, we provide detailed analyses on model scalability and pre-training method design. Code is released at https://github.com/airsplay/vimpac.

**Abstract:** LiDAR-based SLAM system is admittedly more accurate and stable than others, while its loop closure detection is still an open issue. With the development of 3D semantic segmentation for point cloud, semantic information can be obtained conveniently and steadily, essential for high-level intelligence and conductive to SLAM. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-aided LiDAR SLAM with loop closure based on LOAM, named SA-LOAM, which leverages semantics in odometry as well as loop closure detection. Specifically, we propose a semantic-assisted ICP, including semantically matching, downsampling and plane constraint, and integrates a semantic graph-based place recognition method in our loop closure detection module. Benefitting from semantics, we can improve the localization accuracy, detect loop closures effectively, and construct a global consistent semantic map even in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Ford Campus dataset show that our system significantly improves baseline performance, has generalization ability to unseen data and achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Off-policy learning allows us to learn about possible policies of behavior from experience generated by a different behavior policy. Temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms can become unstable when combined with function approximation and off-policy sampling - this is known as the ''deadly triad''. Emphatic temporal difference (ETD($Œª$)) algorithm ensures convergence in the linear case by appropriately weighting the TD($Œª$) updates. In this paper, we extend the use of emphatic methods to deep reinforcement learning agents. We show that naively adapting ETD($Œª$) to popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms, which use forward view multi-step returns, results in poor performance. We then derive new emphatic algorithms for use in the context of such algorithms, and we demonstrate that they provide noticeable benefits in small problems designed to highlight the instability of TD methods. Finally, we observed improved performance when applying these algorithms at scale on classic Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment.

<p>Xu Cheng, Chuntung Chu, Yi Zheng, Jie Ren, Quanshi Zhang</p></summary>
<p>

**Abstract:** In this paper, we rethink how a DNN encodes visual concepts of different complexities from a new perspective, i.e. the game-theoretic multi-order interactions between pixels in an image. Beyond the categorical taxonomy of objects and the cognitive taxonomy of textures and shapes, we provide a new taxonomy of visual concepts, which helps us interpret the encoding of shapes and textures, in terms of concept complexities. In this way, based on multi-order interactions, we find three distinctive signal-processing behaviors of DNNs encoding textures. Besides, we also discover the flexibility for a DNN to encode shapes is lower than the flexibility of encoding textures. Furthermore, we analyze how DNNs encode outlier samples, and explore the impacts of network architectures on interactions. Additionally, we clarify the crucial role of the multi-order interactions in real-world applications. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

<p>

**Abstract:** Many representative graph neural networks, e.g., GPR-GNN and ChebNet, approximate graph convolutions with graph spectral filters. However, existing work either applies predefined filter weights or learns them without necessary constraints, which may lead to oversimplified or ill-posed filters. To overcome these issues, we propose BernNet, a novel graph neural network with theoretical support that provides a simple but effective scheme for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral filters. In particular, for any filter over the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a graph, our BernNet estimates it by an order-$K$ Bernstein polynomial approximation and designs its spectral property by setting the coefficients of the Bernstein basis. Moreover, we can learn the coefficients (and the corresponding filter weights) based on observed graphs and their associated signals and thus achieve the BernNet specialized for the data. Our experiments demonstrate that BernNet can learn arbitrary spectral filters, including complicated band-rejection and comb filters, and it achieves superior performance in real-world graph modeling tasks.

**Abstract:** The best performing Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are usually attained using Adam optimization and its multi-step training variants. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies explore the fundamental reasons why Adam is superior to other optimizers like SGD for BNN optimization or provide analytical explanations that support specific training strategies. To address this, in this paper we first investigate the trajectories of gradients and weights in BNNs during the training process. We show the regularization effect of second-order momentum in Adam is crucial to revitalize the weights that are dead due to the activation saturation in BNNs. We find that Adam, through its adaptive learning rate strategy, is better equipped to handle the rugged loss surface of BNNs and reaches a better optimum with higher generalization ability. Furthermore, we inspect the intriguing role of the real-valued weights in binary networks, and reveal the effect of weight decay on the stability and sluggishness of BNN optimization. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we derive a simple training scheme, building on existing Adam-based optimization, which achieves 70.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset using the same architecture as the state-of-the-art ReActNet while achieving 1.1% higher accuracy.

<p>

**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network has been widely used to alleviate sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems since it can model rich context information in user-item interactions. Graph neural network is able to encode this rich context information through propagation on the graph. However, existing heterogeneous graph neural networks neglect entanglement of the latent factors stemming from different aspects. Moreover, meta paths in existing approaches are simplified as connecting paths or side information between node pairs, overlooking the rich semantic information in the paths. In this paper, we propose a novel disentangled heterogeneous graph attention network DisenHAN for top-$N$ recommendation, which learns disentangled user/item representations from different aspects in a heterogeneous information network. In particular, we use meta relations to decompose high-order connectivity between node pairs and propose a disentangled embedding propagation layer which can iteratively identify the major aspect of meta relations. Our model aggregates corresponding aspect features from each meta relation for the target user/item. With different layers of embedding propagation, DisenHAN is able to explicitly capture the collaborative filtering effect semantically. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that DisenHAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the learned disentangled representations via insightful case studies and visualization.

**Abstract:** The goal of database question answering is to enable natural language querying of real-life relational databases in diverse application domains. Recently, large-scale datasets such as Spider and WikiSQL facilitated novel modeling techniques for text-to-SQL parsing, improving zero-shot generalization to unseen databases. In this work, we examine the challenges that still prevent these techniques from practical deployment. First, we present KaggleDBQA, a new cross-domain evaluation dataset of real Web databases, with domain-specific data types, original formatting, and unrestricted questions. Second, we re-examine the choice of evaluation tasks for text-to-SQL parsers as applied in real-life settings. Finally, we augment our in-domain evaluation task with database documentation, a naturally occurring source of implicit domain knowledge. We show that KaggleDBQA presents a challenge to state-of-the-art zero-shot parsers but a more realistic evaluation setting and creative use of associated database documentation boosts their accuracy by over 13.2%, doubling their performance.

**Abstract:** High-quality automatic speech recognition (ASR) is essential for virtual assistants (VAs) to work well. However, ASR often performs poorly on VA requests containing named entities. In this work, we start from the observation that many ASR errors on named entities are inconsistent with real-world knowledge. We extend previous discriminative n-gram language modeling approaches to incorporate real-world knowledge from a Knowledge Graph (KG), using features that capture entity type-entity and entity-entity relationships. We apply our model through an efficient lattice rescoring process, achieving relative sentence error rate reductions of more than 25% on some synthesized test sets covering less popular entities, with minimal degradation on a uniformly sampled VA test set.

**Abstract:** Gaussian processes are one of the dominant approaches in Bayesian learning. Although the approach has been applied to numerous problems with great success, it has a few fundamental limitations. Multiple methods in literature have addressed these limitations. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey of the topics as of yet. Most existing surveys focus on only one particular variant of Gaussian processes and their derivatives. This survey details the core motivations for using Gaussian processes, their mathematical formulations, limitations, and research themes that have flourished over the years to address said limitations. Furthermore, one particular research area is Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs), it has improved substantially in the past decade. The significant publications that advanced the forefront of this research area are outlined in their survey. Finally, a brief discussion on open problems and research directions for future work is presented at the end.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised domain adaptation is used in many machine learning applications where, during training, a model has access to unlabeled data in the target domain, and a related labeled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general domain-adversarial framework. Specifically, we derive a novel generalization bound for domain adaptation that exploits a new measure of discrepancy between distributions based on a variational characterization of f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David et al. (2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based on this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key correction in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016). We show that many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last years in this framework are then not required to achieve performance comparable to (if not better than) state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods. Experimental analysis conducted on real-world natural language and computer vision datasets show that our framework outperforms existing baselines, and obtains the best results for f-divergences that were not considered previously in domain-adversarial learning.

**Abstract:** The abundance of data has given machine learning considerable momentum in natural sciences and engineering. However, the modeling of simulated physical processes remains difficult. A key problem is the correct handling of geometric boundaries. While triangularized geometric boundaries are very common in engineering applications, they are notoriously difficult to model by machine learning approaches due to their heterogeneity with respect to size and orientation. In this work, we introduce Boundary Graph Neural Networks (BGNNs), which dynamically modify graph structures to address boundary conditions. Boundary graph structures are constructed via modifying edges, augmenting node features, and dynamically inserting virtual nodes. The new BGNNs are tested on complex 3D granular flow processes of hoppers and rotating drums which are standard components of industrial machinery. Using precise simulations that are obtained by an expensive and complex discrete element method, BGNNs are evaluated in terms of computational efficiency as well as prediction accuracy of particle flows and mixing entropies. Even if complex boundaries are present, BGNNs are able to accurately reproduce 3D granular flows within simulation uncertainties over hundreds of thousands of simulation timesteps, and most notably particles completely stay within the geometric objects without using handcrafted conditions or restrictions.

**Abstract:** Environment perception is crucial for autonomous vehicle (AV) safety. Most existing AV perception algorithms have not studied the surrounding environment complexity and failed to include the environment complexity parameter. This paper proposes a novel attention-based neural network model to predict the complexity level of the surrounding driving environment. The proposed model takes naturalistic driving videos and corresponding vehicle dynamics parameters as input. It consists of a Yolo-v3 object detection algorithm, a heat map generation algorithm, CNN-based feature extractors, and attention-based feature extractors for both video and time-series vehicle dynamics data inputs to extract features. The output from the proposed algorithm is a surrounding environment complexity parameter. The Berkeley DeepDrive dataset (BDD Dataset) and subjectively labeled surrounding environment complexity levels are used for model training and validation to evaluate the algorithm. The proposed attention-based network achieves 91.22% average classification accuracy to classify the surrounding environment complexity. It proves that the environment complexity level can be accurately predicted and applied for future AVs' environment perception studies.

**Abstract:** Many scientific datasets are compositional in nature. Important examples include species abundances in ecology, rock compositions in geology, topic compositions in large-scale text corpora, and sequencing count data in molecular biology. Here, we provide a causal view on compositional data in an instrumental variable setting where the composition acts as the cause. Throughout, we pay particular attention to the interpretation of compositional causes from the viewpoint of interventions and crisply articulate potential pitfalls for practitioners. Focusing on modern high-dimensional microbiome sequencing data as a timely illustrative use case, our analysis first reveals that popular one-dimensional information-theoretic summary statistics, such as diversity and richness, may be insufficient for drawing causal conclusions from ecological data. Instead, we advocate for multivariate alternatives using statistical data transformations and regression techniques that take the special structure of the compositional sample space into account. In a comparative analysis on synthetic and semi-synthetic data we show the advantages and limitations of our proposal. We posit that our framework may provide a useful starting point for cause-effect estimation in the context of compositional data.

**Abstract:** This work proposes a novel method to robustly and accurately model time series with heavy-tailed noise, in non-stationary scenarios. In many practical application time series have heavy-tailed noise that significantly impacts the performance of classical forecasting models; in particular, accurately modeling a distribution over extreme events is crucial to performing accurate time series anomaly detection. We propose a Spliced Binned-Pareto distribution which is both robust to extreme observations and allows accurate modeling of the full distribution. Our method allows the capture of time dependencies in the higher order moments of the distribution such as the tail heaviness. We compare the robustness and the accuracy of the tail estimation of our method to other state of the art methods on Twitter mentions count time series.

**Abstract:** We focus on exploring various approaches of Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and their explainability for a challenging yet important supervised learning task notorious for training data scarcity, i.e. Depression Symptoms Detection (DSD) from text. We start with a comprehensive synthesis of different components of our ZSL modeling and analysis of our ground truth samples and Depression symptom clues curation process with the help of a practicing clinician. We next analyze the accuracy of various state-of-the-art ZSL models and their potential enhancements for our task. Further, we sketch a framework for the use of ZSL for hierarchical text-based explanation mechanism, which we call, Syntax Tree-Guided Semantic Explanation (STEP). Finally, we summarize experiments from which we conclude that we can use ZSL models and achieve reasonable accuracy and explainability, measured by a proposed Explainability Index (EI). This work is, to our knowledge, the first work to exhaustively explore the efficacy of ZSL models for DSD task, both in terms of accuracy and explainability.

**Abstract:** We conduct theoretical studies on streaming-based active learning for binary classification under unknown adversarial label corruptions. In this setting, every time before the learner observes a sample, the adversary decides whether to corrupt the label or not. First, we show that, in a benign corruption setting (which includes the misspecification setting as a special case), with a slight enlargement on the hypothesis elimination threshold, the classical RobustCAL framework can (surprisingly) achieve nearly the same label complexity guarantee as in the non-corrupted setting. However, this algorithm can fail in the general corruption setting. To resolve this drawback, we propose a new algorithm which is provably correct without any assumptions on the presence of corruptions. Furthermore, this algorithm enjoys the minimax label complexity in the non-corrupted setting (which is achieved by RobustCAL) and only requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(C_{\mathrm{total}})$ additional labels in the corrupted setting to achieve $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon + \frac{C_{\mathrm{total}}}{n})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $C_{\mathrm{total}}$ is the total number of corruptions and $n$ is the total number of unlabeled samples.

<p>

**Abstract:** Many robot manipulation tasks require the robot to make and break contact with objects and surfaces. The dynamics of such changing-contact robot manipulation tasks are discontinuous when contact is made or broken, and continuous elsewhere. These discontinuities make it difficult to construct and use a single dynamics model or control strategy for any such task. We present a framework for smooth dynamics and control of such changing-contact manipulation tasks. For any given target motion trajectory, the framework incrementally improves its prediction of when contacts will occur. This prediction and a model relating approach velocity to impact force modify the velocity profile of the motion sequence such that it is $C^\infty$ smooth, and help achieve a desired force on impact. We implement this framework by building on our hybrid force-motion variable impedance controller for continuous contact tasks. We experimentally evaluate our framework in the illustrative context of sliding tasks involving multiple contact changes with transitions between surfaces of different properties.

**Abstract:** We present a no-code Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform called Trinity with the main design goal of enabling both machine learning researchers and non-technical geospatial domain experts to experiment with domain-specific signals and datasets for solving a variety of complex problems on their own. This versatility to solve diverse problems is achieved by transforming complex Spatio-temporal datasets to make them consumable by standard deep learning models, in this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and giving the ability to formulate disparate problems in a standard way, eg. semantic segmentation. With an intuitive user interface, a feature store that hosts derivatives of complex feature engineering, a deep learning kernel, and a scalable data processing mechanism, Trinity provides a powerful platform for domain experts to share the stage with scientists and engineers in solving business-critical problems. It enables quick prototyping, rapid experimentation and reduces the time to production by standardizing model building and deployment. In this paper, we present our motivation behind Trinity and its design along with showcasing sample applications to motivate the idea of lowering the bar to using AI.

**Abstract:** Social media platforms bring together content creators and content consumers through recommender systems like newsfeed. The focus of such recommender systems has thus far been primarily on modeling the content consumer preferences and optimizing for their experience. However, it is equally critical to nurture content creation by prioritizing the creators' interests, as quality content forms the seed for sustainable engagement and conversations, bringing in new consumers while retaining existing ones. In this work, we propose a modeling approach to predict how feedback from content consumers incentivizes creators. We then leverage this model to optimize the newsfeed experience for content creators by reshaping the feedback distribution, leading to a more active content ecosystem. Practically, we discuss how we balance the user experience for both consumers and creators, and how we carry out online A/B tests with strong network effects. We present a deployed use case on the LinkedIn newsfeed, where we used this approach to improve content creation significantly without compromising the consumers' experience.

**Abstract:** Two non-intrusive uncertainty propagation approaches are proposed for the performance analysis of engineering systems described by expensive-to-evaluate deterministic computer models with parameters defined as interval variables. These approaches employ a machine learning based optimization strategy, the so-called Bayesian optimization, for evaluating the upper and lower bounds of a generic response variable over the set of possible responses obtained when each interval variable varies independently over its range. The lack of knowledge caused by not evaluating the response function for all the possible combinations of the interval variables is accounted for by developing a probabilistic description of the response variable itself by using a Gaussian Process regression model. An iterative procedure is developed for selecting a small number of simulations to be evaluated for updating this statistical model by using well-established acquisition functions and to assess the response bounds. In both approaches, an initial training dataset is defined. While one approach builds iteratively two distinct training datasets for evaluating separately the upper and lower bounds of the response variable, the other builds iteratively a single training dataset. Consequently, the two approaches will produce different bound estimates at each iteration. The upper and lower bound responses are expressed as point estimates obtained from the mean function of the posterior distribution. Moreover, a confidence interval on each estimate is provided for effectively communicating to engineers when these estimates are obtained for a combination of the interval variables for which no deterministic simulation has been run. Finally, two metrics are proposed to define conditions for assessing if the predicted bound estimates can be considered satisfactory.

**Abstract:** Recent discoveries in Deep Neural Networks are allowing researchers to tackle some very complex problems such as image classification and audio classification, with improved theoretical and empirical justifications. This paper presents a novel scheme to incorporate the use of autoencoders in Fuzzy rule classifiers (FRC). Autoencoders when stacked can learn the complex non-linear relationships amongst data, and the proposed framework built towards FRC can allow users to input expert knowledge to the system. This paper further introduces four novel fine-tuning strategies for autoencoders to improve the FRC's classification and rule reduction performance. The proposed framework has been tested across five real-world benchmark datasets. Elaborate comparisons with over 15 previous studies, and across 10-fold cross validation performance, suggest that the proposed methods are capable of building FRCs which can provide state of the art accuracies.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained deep nets are commonly used to improve accuracies and training times for neural nets. It is generally assumed that pre-training a net for optimal source task performance best prepares it to learn an arbitrary target task. This is generally not true. Stopping source task training, prior to optimal performance, can create a pre-trained net better suited for learning a new task.
  We performed several experiments demonstrating this effect, as well as the influence of amount of training and of learning rate. Additionally, we show that this reflects a general loss of learning ability that even extends to relearning the source task

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained increasing interest since the demonstration it was able to reach human performance on video game benchmarks using deep Q-learning (DQN). The current consensus for training neural networks on such complex environments is to rely on gradient-based optimization. Although alternative Bayesian deep learning methods exist, most of them still rely on gradient-based optimization, and they typically do not scale on benchmarks such as the Atari game environment. Moreover none of these approaches allow performing the analytical inference for the weights and biases defining the neural network. In this paper, we present how we can adapt the temporal difference Q-learning framework to make it compatible with the tractable approximate Gaussian inference (TAGI), which allows learning the parameters of a neural network using a closed-form analytical method. Throughout the experiments with on- and off-policy reinforcement learning approaches, we demonstrate that TAGI can reach a performance comparable to backpropagation-trained networks while using fewer hyperparameters, and without relying on gradient-based optimization.

**Abstract:** Gesture recognition is a fundamental tool to enable novel interaction paradigms in a variety of application scenarios like Mixed Reality environments, touchless public kiosks, entertainment systems, and more. Recognition of hand gestures can be nowadays performed directly from the stream of hand skeletons estimated by software provided by low-cost trackers (Ultraleap) and MR headsets (Hololens, Oculus Quest) or by video processing software modules (e.g. Google Mediapipe). Despite the recent advancements in gesture and action recognition from skeletons, it is unclear how well the current state-of-the-art techniques can perform in a real-world scenario for the recognition of a wide set of heterogeneous gestures, as many benchmarks do not test online recognition and use limited dictionaries. This motivated the proposal of the SHREC 2021: Track on Skeleton-based Hand Gesture Recognition in the Wild. For this contest, we created a novel dataset with heterogeneous gestures featuring different types and duration. These gestures have to be found inside sequences in an online recognition scenario. This paper presents the result of the contest, showing the performances of the techniques proposed by four research groups on the challenging task compared with a simple baseline method.

**Abstract:** Inspired by evidence that pretrained language models (LMs) encode commonsense knowledge, recent work has applied LMs to automatically populate commonsense knowledge graphs (CKGs). However, there is a lack of understanding on their generalization to multiple CKGs, unseen relations, and novel entities. This paper analyzes the ability of LMs to perform generalizable commonsense inference, in terms of knowledge capacity, transferability, and induction. Our experiments with these three aspects show that: (1) LMs can adapt to different schemas defined by multiple CKGs but fail to reuse the knowledge to generalize to new relations. (2) Adapted LMs generalize well to unseen subjects, but less so on novel objects. Future work should investigate how to improve the transferability and induction of commonsense mining from LMs.

It predicts that only highly probable propositions are believed, and that many widely held principles of belief-revision fail.

**Abstract:** High-resolution satellite imagery has proven useful for a broad range of tasks, including measurement of global human population, local economic livelihoods, and biodiversity, among many others. Unfortunately, high-resolution imagery is both infrequently collected and expensive to purchase, making it hard to efficiently and effectively scale these downstream tasks over both time and space. We propose a new conditional pixel synthesis model that uses abundant, low-cost, low-resolution imagery to generate accurate high-resolution imagery at locations and times in which it is unavailable. We show that our model attains photo-realistic sample quality and outperforms competing baselines on a key downstream task -- object counting -- particularly in geographic locations where conditions on the ground are changing rapidly.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a novel visual representation learning which relies on a handful of adaptively learned tokens, and which is applicable to both image and video understanding tasks. Instead of relying on hand-designed splitting strategies to obtain visual tokens and processing a large number of densely sampled patches for attention, our approach learns to mine important tokens in visual data. This results in efficiently and effectively finding a few important visual tokens and enables modeling of pairwise attention between such tokens, over a longer temporal horizon for videos, or the spatial content in images. Our experiments demonstrate strong performance on several challenging benchmarks for both image and video recognition tasks. Importantly, due to our tokens being adaptive, we accomplish competitive results at significantly reduced compute amount. We obtain comparable results to the state-of-the-arts on ImageNet while being computationally more efficient. We establish new state-of-the-arts on multiple video datasets, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, Charades, and AViD.

**Abstract:** The weakly supervised sound event detection problem is the task of predicting the presence of sound events and their corresponding starting and ending points in a weakly labeled dataset. A weak dataset associates each training sample (a short recording) to one or more present sources. Networks that solely rely on convolutional and recurrent layers cannot directly relate multiple frames in a recording. Motivated by attention and graph neural networks, we introduce the concept of an affinity mixup to incorporate time-level similarities and make a connection between frames. This regularization technique mixes up features in different layers using an adaptive affinity matrix. Our proposed affinity mixup network improves over state-of-the-art techniques event-F1 scores by $8.2\%$.

**Abstract:** Multi-view clustering, a long-standing and important research problem, focuses on mining complementary information from diverse views. However, existing works often fuse multiple views' representations or handle clustering in a common feature space, which may result in their entanglement especially for visual representations. To address this issue, we present a novel VAE-based multi-view clustering framework (Multi-VAE) by learning disentangled visual representations. Concretely, we define a view-common variable and multiple view-peculiar variables in the generative model. The prior of view-common variable obeys approximately discrete Gumbel Softmax distribution, which is introduced to extract the common cluster factor of multiple views. Meanwhile, the prior of view-peculiar variable follows continuous Gaussian distribution, which is used to represent each view's peculiar visual factors. By controlling the mutual information capacity to disentangle the view-common and view-peculiar representations, continuous visual information of multiple views can be separated so that their common discrete cluster information can be effectively mined. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi-VAE enjoys the disentangled and explainable visual representations, while obtaining superior clustering performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** This paper advocates privacy preserving requirements on collection of user data for recommender systems. The purpose of our study is twofold. First, we ask if restrictions on data collection will hurt test quality of RNN-based recommendations. We study how validation performance depends on the available amount of training data. We use a combination of top-K accuracy, catalog coverage and novelty for this purpose, since good recommendations for the user is not necessarily captured by a traditional accuracy metric. Second, we ask if we can improve the quality under minimal data by using secondary data sources. We propose knowledge transfer for this purpose and construct a representation to measure similarities between purchase behaviour in data. This to make qualified judgements of which source domain will contribute the most. Our results show that (i) there is a saturation in test performance when training size is increased above a critical point. We also discuss the interplay between different performance metrics, and properties of data. Moreover, we demonstrate that (ii) our representation is meaningful for measuring purchase behaviour. In particular, results show that we can leverage secondary data to improve validation performance if we select a relevant source domain according to our similarly measure.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel high-fidelity expressive speech synthesis model, UniTTS, that learns and controls overlapping style attributes avoiding interference. UniTTS represents multiple style attributes in a single unified embedding space by the residuals between the phoneme embeddings before and after applying the attributes. The proposed method is especially effective in controlling multiple attributes that are difficult to separate cleanly, such as speaker ID and emotion, because it minimizes redundancy when adding variance in speaker ID and emotion, and additionally, predicts duration, pitch, and energy based on the speaker ID and emotion. In experiments, the visualization results exhibit that the proposed methods learned multiple attributes harmoniously in a manner that can be easily separated again. As well, UniTTS synthesized high-fidelity speech signals controlling multiple style attributes. The synthesized speech samples are presented at https://jackson-kang.github.io/paper_works/UniTTS/demos.

**Abstract:** In recent years, a lot of attention is paid to deep learning methods in the context of vision-based construction site safety systems, especially regarding personal protective equipment. However, despite all this attention, there is still no reliable way to establish the relationship between workers and their hard hats. To answer this problem a combination of deep learning, object detection and head keypoint localization, with simple rule-based reasoning is proposed in this article. In tests, this solution surpassed the previous methods based on the relative bounding box position of different instances, as well as direct detection of hard hat wearers and non-wearers. The results show that the conjunction of novel deep learning methods with humanly-interpretable rule-based systems can result in a solution that is both reliable and can successfully mimic manual, on-site supervision. This work is the next step in the development of fully autonomous construction site safety systems and shows that there is still room for improvement in this area.

**Abstract:** We develop nested variational inference (NVI), a family of methods that learn proposals for nested importance samplers by minimizing an forward or reverse KL divergence at each level of nesting. NVI is applicable to many commonly-used importance sampling strategies and provides a mechanism for learning intermediate densities, which can serve as heuristics to guide the sampler. Our experiments apply NVI to (a) sample from a multimodal distribution using a learned annealing path (b) learn heuristics that approximate the likelihood of future observations in a hidden Markov model and (c) to perform amortized inference in hierarchical deep generative models. We observe that optimizing nested objectives leads to improved sample quality in terms of log average weight and effective sample size.

**Abstract:** Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for measuring viscoelasticity heavily depends on proper tissue segmentation, especially in heterogeneous organs such as the prostate. Using trained network-based image segmentation, we investigated if MRE data suffice to extract anatomical and viscoelastic information for automatic tabulation of zonal mechanical properties of the prostate. Overall, 40 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer (PCa) were examined with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences: T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and MRE-based tomoelastography yielding six independent sets of imaging data per patient (T2w, DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MRE magnitude, shear wave speed, and loss angle maps). Combinations of these data were used to train Dense U-nets with manually segmented masks of the entire prostate gland (PG), central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ) in 30 patients and to validate them in 10 patients. Dice score (DS), sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff distance were determined. We found that segmentation based on MRE magnitude maps alone (DS, PG: 0.93$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.95$\pm$0.03, PZ: 0.77$\pm$0.05) was more accurate than magnitude maps combined with T2w and DWI_b (DS, PG: 0.91$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.91$\pm$0.06, PZ: 0.63$\pm$0.16) or T2w alone (DS, PG: 0.92$\pm$0.03, CZ: 0.91$\pm$0.04, PZ: 0.65$\pm$0.08). Automatically tabulated MRE values were not different from ground-truth values (P>0.05). In conclusion: MRE combined with Dense U-net segmentation allows tabulation of quantitative imaging markers without manual analysis and independent of other MRI sequences and can thus contribute to PCa detection and classification.

**Abstract:** To protect the location of camera trap data containing sensitive, high-target species, many ecologists randomly obfuscate the latitude and longitude of the camera when publishing their data. For example, they may publish a random location within a 1km radius of the true camera location for each camera in their network. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of geo-obfuscation for maintaining camera trap location privacy, and show via a case study that a few simple, intuitive heuristics and publicly available satellite rasters can be used to reduce the area likely to contain the camera by 87% (assuming random obfuscation within 1km), demonstrating that geo-obfuscation may be less effective than previously believed.

**Abstract:** Covariate shift arises when the labelled training (source) data is not representative of the unlabelled (target) data due to systematic differences in the covariate distributions. A supervised model trained on the source data subject to covariate shift may suffer from poor generalization on the target data. We propose a novel, statistically principled and theoretically justified method to improve learning under covariate shift conditions, based on propensity score stratification, a well-established methodology in causal inference. We show that the effects of covariate shift can be reduced or altogether eliminated by conditioning on propensity scores. In practice, this is achieved by fitting learners on subgroups ("strata") constructed by partitioning the data based on the estimated propensity scores, leading to balanced covariates and much-improved target prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general-purpose method on contemporary research questions in observational cosmology, and on additional benchmark examples, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art importance weighting methods, widely studied in the covariate shift literature. We obtain the best reported AUC (0.958) on the updated "Supernovae photometric classification challenge" and improve upon existing conditional density estimation of galaxy redshift from Sloan Data Sky Survey (SDSS) data.

**Abstract:** Grant-free random access and uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been introduced to reduce transmission latency and signaling overhead in massive machine-type communication (mMTC). In this paper, we propose two novel group-based deep neural network active user detection (AUD) schemes for the grant-free sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system in mMTC uplink framework. The proposed AUD schemes learn the nonlinear mapping, i.e., multi-dimensional codebook structure and the channel characteristic. This is accomplished through the received signal which incorporates the sparse structure of device activity with the training dataset. Moreover, the offline pre-trained model is able to detect the active devices without any channel state information and prior knowledge of the device sparsity level. Simulation results show that with several active devices, the proposed schemes obtain more than twice the probability of detection compared to the conventional AUD schemes over the signal to noise ratio range of interest.

**Abstract:** Lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for sentiment classifiers to process continuous streams of opinioned information on the Web. However, performing lifelong learning is non-trivial for deep neural networks as continually training of incrementally available information inevitably results in catastrophic forgetting or interference. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative network pruning with uncertainty regularization method for lifelong sentiment classification (IPRLS), which leverages the principles of network pruning and weight regularization. By performing network pruning with uncertainty regularization in an iterative manner, IPRLS can adapta single BERT model to work with continuously arriving data from multiple domains while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and interference. Specifically, we leverage an iterative pruning method to remove redundant parameters in large deep networks so that the freed-up space can then be employed to learn new tasks, tackling the catastrophic forgetting problem. Instead of keeping the old-tasks fixed when learning new tasks, we also use an uncertainty regularization based on the Bayesian online learning framework to constrain the update of old tasks weights in BERT, which enables positive backward transfer, i.e. learning new tasks improves performance on past tasks while protecting old knowledge from being lost. In addition, we propose a task-specific low-dimensional residual function in parallel to each layer of BERT, which makes IPRLS less prone to losing the knowledge saved in the base BERT network when learning a new task. Extensive experiments on 16 popular review corpora demonstrate that the proposed IPRLS method sig-nificantly outperforms the strong baselines for lifelong sentiment classification. For reproducibility, we submit the code and data at:https://github.com/siat-nlp/IPRLS.

**Abstract:** Multi-modal clustering, which explores complementary information from multiple modalities or views, has attracted people's increasing attentions. However, existing works rarely focus on extracting high-level semantic information of multiple modalities for clustering. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Multi-Modal Clustering (CMMC) which can mine high-level semantic information via contrastive learning. Concretely, our framework consists of three parts. (1) Multiple autoencoders are optimized to maintain each modality's diversity to learn complementary information. (2) A feature contrastive module is proposed to learn common high-level semantic features from different modalities. (3) A label contrastive module aims to learn consistent cluster assignments for all modalities. By the proposed multi-modal contrastive learning, the mutual information of high-level features is maximized, while the diversity of the low-level latent features is maintained. In addition, to utilize the learned high-level semantic features, we further generate pseudo labels by solving a maximum matching problem to fine-tune the cluster assignments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMMC has good scalability and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal clustering methods.

**Abstract:** Established approaches to obtain generalization bounds in data-driven optimization and machine learning mostly build on solutions from empirical risk minimization (ERM), which depend crucially on the functional complexity of the hypothesis class. In this paper, we present an alternate route to obtain these bounds on the solution from distributionally robust optimization (DRO), a recent data-driven optimization framework based on worst-case analysis and the notion of ambiguity set to capture statistical uncertainty. In contrast to the hypothesis class complexity in ERM, our DRO bounds depend on the ambiguity set geometry and its compatibility with the true loss function. Notably, when using maximum mean discrepancy as a DRO distance metric, our analysis implies, to the best of our knowledge, the first generalization bound in the literature that depends solely on the true loss function, entirely free of any complexity measures or bounds on the hypothesis class.

**Abstract:** The predictive capabilities of turbulent flow simulations, critical for aerodynamic design and weather prediction, hinge on the choice of turbulence models. The abundance of data from experiments and simulations and the advent of machine learning have provided a boost to these modeling efforts. However, simulations of turbulent flows remain hindered by the inability of heuristics and supervised learning to model the near-wall dynamics. We address this challenge by introducing scientific multi-agent reinforcement learning (SciMARL) for the discovery of wall models for large-eddy simulations (LES). In SciMARL, discretization points act also as cooperating agents that learn to supply the LES closure model. The agents self-learn using limited data and generalize to extreme Reynolds numbers and previously unseen geometries. The present simulations reduce by several orders of magnitude the computational cost over fully-resolved simulations while reproducing key flow quantities. We believe that SciMARL creates new capabilities for the simulation of turbulent flows.

**Abstract:** Operational forecasting centers are investing in decadal (1-10 year) forecast systems to support long-term decision making for a more climate-resilient society. One method that has previously been employed is the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm - also known as the Linear Inverse Model - which fits linear dynamical models to data. While the DMD usually approximates non-linear terms in the true dynamics as a linear system with random noise, we investigate an extension to the DMD that explicitly represents the non-linear terms as a neural network. Our weight initialization allows the network to produce sensible results before training and then improve the prediction after training as data becomes available. In this short paper, we evaluate the proposed architecture for simulating global sea surface temperatures and compare the results with the standard DMD and seasonal forecasts produced by the state-of-the-art dynamical model, CFSv2.

**Abstract:** Recently introduced self-supervised methods for image representation learning provide on par or superior results to their fully supervised competitors, yet the corresponding efforts to explain the self-supervised approaches lag behind. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel visual probing framework for explaining the self-supervised models by leveraging probing tasks employed previously in natural language processing. The probing tasks require knowledge about semantic relationships between image parts. Hence, we propose a systematic approach to obtain analogs of natural language in vision, such as visual words, context, and taxonomy. Our proposal is grounded in Marr's computational theory of vision and concerns features like textures, shapes, and lines. We show the effectiveness and applicability of those analogs in the context of explaining self-supervised representations. Our key findings emphasize that relations between language and vision can serve as an effective yet intuitive tool for discovering how machine learning models work, independently of data modality. Our work opens a plethora of research pathways towards more explainable and transparent AI.

**Abstract:** Despite extensive research into adversarial attacks, we do not know how adversarial attacks affect image pixels. Knowing how image pixels are affected by adversarial attacks has the potential to lead us to better adversarial defenses. Motivated by instances that we find where strong attacks do not transfer, we delve into adversarial examples at pixel level to scrutinize how adversarial attacks affect image pixel values. We consider several ImageNet architectures, InceptionV3, VGG19 and ResNet50, as well as several strong attacks. We find that attacks can have different effects at pixel level depending on classifier architecture. In particular, input pre-processing plays a previously overlooked role in the effect that attacks have on pixels. Based on the insights of pixel-level examination, we find new ways to detect some of the strongest current attacks.

**Abstract:** Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) allows to analyze binary data by deriving concepts and ordering them in lattices. One of the main goals of FCA is to enable humans to comprehend the information that is encapsulated in the data; however, the large size of concept lattices is a limiting factor for the feasibility of understanding the underlying structural properties. The size of such a lattice depends on the number of subcontexts in the corresponding formal context that are isomorphic to a contranominal scale of high dimension. In this work, we propose the algorithm ContraFinder that enables the computation of all contranominal scales of a given formal context. Leveraging this algorithm, we introduce delta-adjusting, a novel approach in order to decrease the number of contranominal scales in a formal context by the selection of an appropriate attribute subset. We demonstrate that delta-adjusting a context reduces the size of the hereby emerging sub-semilattice and that the implication set is restricted to meaningful implications. This is evaluated with respect to its associated knowledge by means of a classification task. Hence, our proposed technique strongly improves understandability while preserving important conceptual structures.

**Abstract:** Logical relations widely exist in human activities. Human use them for making judgement and decision according to various conditions, which are embodied in the form of \emph{if-then} rules. As an important kind of cognitive intelligence, it is prerequisite of representing and storing logical relations rightly into computer systems so as to make automatic judgement and decision, especially for high-risk domains like medical diagnosis. However, current numeric ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models are good at perceptual intelligence such as image recognition while they are not good at cognitive intelligence such as logical representation, blocking the further application of ANN. To solve it, researchers have tried to design logical ANN models to represent and store logical relations. Although there are some advances in this research area, recent works still have disadvantages because the structures of these logical ANN models still don't map more directly with logical relations which will cause the corresponding logical relations cannot be read out from their network structures. Therefore, in order to represent logical relations more clearly by the neural network structure and to read out logical relations from it, this paper proposes a novel logical ANN model by designing the new logical neurons and links in demand of logical representation. Compared with the recent works on logical ANN models, this logical ANN model has more clear corresponding with logical relations using the more direct mapping method herein, thus logical relations can be read out following the connection patterns of the network structure. Additionally, less neurons are used.

**Abstract:** Most modern neural networks for classification fail to take into account the concept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an unrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In an attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open set environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of incremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial trained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and autonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some problems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to retrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy as multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new classes is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address these problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold approach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies high by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources used in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on the idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when exposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method can be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network architecture.

**Abstract:** We study mean-field variational Bayesian inference using the TAP approach, for Z2-synchronization as a prototypical example of a high-dimensional Bayesian model. We show that for any signal strength $Œª> 1$ (the weak-recovery threshold), there exists a unique local minimizer of the TAP free energy functional near the mean of the Bayes posterior law. Furthermore, the TAP free energy in a local neighborhood of this minimizer is strongly convex. Consequently, a natural-gradient/mirror-descent algorithm achieves linear convergence to this minimizer from a local initialization, which may be obtained by a finite number of iterates of Approximate Message Passing (AMP). This provides a rigorous foundation for variational inference in high dimensions via minimization of the TAP free energy.
  We also analyze the finite-sample convergence of AMP, showing that AMP is asymptotically stable at the TAP minimizer for any $Œª> 1$, and is linearly convergent to this minimizer from a spectral initialization for sufficiently large $Œª$. Such a guarantee is stronger than results obtainable by state evolution analyses, which only describe a fixed number of AMP iterations in the infinite-sample limit.
  Our proofs combine the Kac-Rice formula and Sudakov-Fernique Gaussian comparison inequality to analyze the complexity of critical points that satisfy strong convexity and stability conditions within their local neighborhoods.

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art summarization systems are trained and evaluated on massive datasets scraped from the web. Despite their prevalence, we know very little about the underlying characteristics (data noise, summarization complexity, etc.) of these datasets, and how these affect system performance and the reliability of automatic metrics like ROUGE. In this study, we manually analyze 600 samples from three popular summarization datasets. Our study is driven by a six-class typology which captures different noise types (missing facts, entities) and degrees of summarization difficulty (extractive, abstractive). We follow with a thorough analysis of 27 state-of-the-art summarization models and 5 popular metrics, and report our key insights: (1) Datasets have distinct data quality and complexity distributions, which can be traced back to their collection process. (2) The performance of models and reliability of metrics is dependent on sample complexity. (3) Faithful summaries often receive low scores because of the poor diversity of references. We release the code, annotated data and model outputs.

**Abstract:** We propose a curriculum-driven learning strategy for solving difficult multi-agent coordination tasks. Our method is inspired by a study of animal communication, which shows that two straightforward design features (mutual reward and decentralization) support a vast spectrum of communication protocols in nature. We highlight the importance of similarly interpreting emergent communication as a spectrum. We introduce a toroidal, continuous-space pursuit-evasion environment and show that naive decentralized learning does not perform well. We then propose a novel curriculum-driven strategy for multi-agent learning. Experiments with pursuit-evasion show that our approach enables decentralized pursuers to learn to coordinate and capture a superior evader, significantly outperforming sophisticated analytical policies. We argue through additional quantitative analysis -- including influence-based measures such as Instantaneous Coordination -- that emergent implicit communication plays a large role in enabling superior levels of coordination.

**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed great success in handling node classification tasks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNNs are based on the assumption that node samples for different classes are balanced, while for many real-world graphs, there exists the problem of class imbalance, i.e., some classes may have much fewer samples than others. In this case, directly training a GNN classifier with raw data would under-represent samples from those minority classes and result in sub-optimal performance. This paper presents GraphMixup, a novel mixup-based framework for improving class-imbalanced node classification on graphs. However, directly performing mixup in the input space or embedding space may produce out-of-domain samples due to the extreme sparsity of minority classes; hence we construct semantic relation spaces that allows the Feature Mixup to be performed at the semantic level. Moreover, we apply two context-based self-supervised techniques to capture both local and global information in the graph structure and then propose Edge Mixup specifically for graph data. Finally, we develop a \emph{Reinforcement Mixup} mechanism to adaptively determine how many samples are to be generated by mixup for those minority classes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that GraphMixup yields truly encouraging results for class-imbalanced node classification tasks.

**Abstract:** When machine learning models encounter data which is out of the distribution on which they were trained they have a tendency to behave poorly, most prominently over-confidence in erroneous predictions. Such behaviours will have disastrous effects on real-world machine learning systems. In this field graceful degradation refers to the optimisation of model performance as it encounters this out-of-distribution data. This work presents a definition and discussion of graceful degradation and where it can be applied in deployed visual systems. Following this a survey of relevant areas is undertaken, novelly splitting the graceful degradation problem into active and passive approaches. In passive approaches, graceful degradation is handled and achieved by the model in a self-contained manner, in active approaches the model is updated upon encountering epistemic uncertainties. This work communicates the importance of the problem and aims to prompt the development of machine learning strategies that are aware of graceful degradation.

**Abstract:** Because it determines a center-outward ordering of observations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\geq 2$, the concept of statistical depth permits to define quantiles and ranks for multivariate data and use them for various statistical tasks (e.g. inference, hypothesis testing). Whereas many depth functions have been proposed \textit{ad-hoc} in the literature since the seminal contribution of \cite{Tukey75}, not all of them possess the properties desirable to emulate the notion of quantile function for univariate probability distributions. In this paper, we propose an extension of the \textit{integrated rank-weighted} statistical depth (IRW depth in abbreviated form) originally introduced in \cite{IRW}, modified in order to satisfy the property of \textit{affine-invariance}, fulfilling thus all the four key axioms listed in the nomenclature elaborated by \cite{ZuoS00a}. The variant we propose, referred to as the Affine-Invariant IRW depth (AI-IRW in short), involves the covariance/precision matrices of the (supposedly square integrable) $d$-dimensional random vector $X$ under study, in order to take into account the directions along which $X$ is most variable to assign a depth value to any point $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$. The accuracy of the sampling version of the AI-IRW depth is investigated from a nonasymptotic perspective. Namely, a concentration result for the statistical counterpart of the AI-IRW depth is proved. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, applications to anomaly detection are considered and numerical results are displayed, providing strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the depth function we propose here.

**Abstract:** In the operation & maintenance (O&M) of photovoltaic (PV) plants, the early identification of failures has become crucial to maintain productivity and prolong components' life. Of all defects, cell-level anomalies can lead to serious failures and may affect surrounding PV modules in the long run. These fine defects are usually captured with high spatial resolution electroluminescence (EL) imaging. The difficulty of acquiring such images has limited the availability of data. For this work, multiple data resources and augmentation techniques have been used to surpass this limitation. Current state-of-the-art detection methods extract barely low-level information from individual PV cell images, and their performance is conditioned by the available training data. In this article, we propose an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that detects, locates and segments cell-level anomalies from entire photovoltaic modules via EL images. The proposed modular pipeline combines three deep learning techniques: 1. object detection (modified Faster-RNN), 2. image classification (EfficientNet) and 3. weakly supervised segmentation (autoencoder). The modular nature of the pipeline allows to upgrade the deep learning models to the further improvements in the state-of-the-art and also extend the pipeline towards new functionalities.

**Abstract:** Providing a human-understandable explanation of classifiers' decisions has become imperative to generate trust in their use for day-to-day tasks. Although many works have addressed this problem by generating visual explanation maps, they often provide noisy and inaccurate results forcing the use of heuristic regularization unrelated to the classifier in question. In this paper, we propose a new general perspective of the visual explanation problem overcoming these limitations. We show that visual explanation can be produced as the difference between two generated images obtained via two specific conditional generative models. Both generative models are trained using the classifier to explain and a database to enforce the following properties: (i) All images generated by the first generator are classified similarly to the input image, whereas the second generator's outputs are classified oppositely. (ii) Generated images belong to the distribution of real images. (iii) The distances between the input image and the corresponding generated images are minimal so that the difference between the generated elements only reveals relevant information for the studied classifier. Using symmetrical and cyclic constraints, we present two different approximations and implementations of the general formulation. Experimentally, we demonstrate significant improvements w.r.t the state-of-the-art on three different public data sets. In particular, the localization of regions influencing the classifier is consistent with human annotations.

**Abstract:** Recent machine learning advances have proposed black-box estimation of unknown continuous-time system dynamics directly from data. However, earlier works are based on approximative ODE solutions or point estimates. We propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model that uses Gaussian processes to infer posteriors of unknown ODE systems directly from data. We derive sparse variational inference with decoupled functional sampling to represent vector field posteriors. We also introduce a probabilistic shooting augmentation to enable efficient inference from arbitrarily long trajectories. The method demonstrates the benefit of computing vector field posteriors, with predictive uncertainty scores outperforming alternative methods on multiple ODE learning tasks.

**Abstract:** Learning with noisy labels is a practically challenging problem in weakly supervised learning. In the existing literature, open-set noises are always considered to be poisonous for generalization, similar to closed-set noises. In this paper, we empirically show that open-set noisy labels can be non-toxic and even benefit the robustness against inherent noisy labels. Inspired by the observations, we propose a simple yet effective regularization by introducing Open-set samples with Dynamic Noisy Labels (ODNL) into training. With ODNL, the extra capacity of the neural network can be largely consumed in a way that does not interfere with learning patterns from clean data. Through the lens of SGD noise, we show that the noises induced by our method are random-direction, conflict-free and biased, which may help the model converge to a flat minimum with superior stability and enforce the model to produce conservative predictions on Out-of-Distribution instances. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets with various types of noisy labels demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the performance of many existing robust algorithms but also achieves significant improvement on Out-of-Distribution detection tasks even in the label noise setting.

**Abstract:** Place Recognition is a crucial capability for mobile robot localization and navigation. Image-based or Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a challenging problem as scene appearance and camera viewpoint can change significantly when places are revisited. Recent VPR methods based on ``sequential representations'' have shown promising results as compared to traditional sequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to these endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored following the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However, a key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation always superior to an implicit ``spatial'' representation based on sequence of RGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended abstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a similar ``metric span'' to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based method (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and showcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass, the performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span. These performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness of input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot. While a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two different modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of answering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to several applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.

**Abstract:** Coronary X-ray angiography is a crucial clinical procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease, which accounts for roughly 16% of global deaths every year. However, the images acquired in these procedures have low resolution and poor contrast, making lesion detection and assessment challenging. Accurate coronary artery segmentation not only helps mitigate these problems, but also allows the extraction of relevant anatomical features for further analysis by quantitative methods. Although automated segmentation of coronary arteries has been proposed before, previous approaches have used non-optimal segmentation criteria, leading to less useful results. Most methods either segment only the major vessel, discarding important information from the remaining ones, or segment the whole coronary tree based mostly on contrast information, producing a noisy output that includes vessels that are not relevant for diagnosis. We adopt a better-suited clinical criterion and segment vessels according to their clinical relevance. Additionally, we simultaneously perform catheter segmentation, which may be useful for diagnosis due to the scale factor provided by the catheter's known diameter, and is a task that has not yet been performed with good results. To derive the optimal approach, we conducted an extensive comparative study of encoder-decoder architectures trained on a combination of focal loss and a variant of generalized dice loss. Based on the EfficientNet and the UNet++ architectures, we propose a line of efficient and high-performance segmentation models using a new decoder architecture, the EfficientUNet++, whose best-performing version achieved average dice scores of 0.8904 and 0.7526 for the artery and catheter classes, respectively, and an average generalized dice score of 0.9234.

**Abstract:** We characterize the measurement complexity of compressed sensing of signals drawn from a known prior distribution, even when the support of the prior is the entire space (rather than, say, sparse vectors). We show for Gaussian measurements and \emph{any} prior distribution on the signal, that the posterior sampling estimator achieves near-optimal recovery guarantees. Moreover, this result is robust to model mismatch, as long as the distribution estimate (e.g., from an invertible generative model) is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance. We implement the posterior sampling estimator for deep generative priors using Langevin dynamics, and empirically find that it produces accurate estimates with more diversity than MAP.

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is essential to large-scale robotic systems. Recent methods have applied reinforcement learning (RL) to learn decentralized polices in partially observable environments. A fundamental challenge of obtaining collision-free policy is that agents need to learn cooperation to handle congested situations. This paper combines communication with deep Q-learning to provide a novel learning based method for MAPF, where agents achieve cooperation via graph convolution. To guide RL algorithm on long-horizon goal-oriented tasks, we embed the potential choices of shortest paths from single source as heuristic guidance instead of using a specific path as in most existing works. Our method treats each agent independently and trains the model from a single agent's perspective. The final trained policy is applied to each agent for decentralized execution. The whole system is distributed during training and is trained under a curriculum learning strategy. Empirical evaluation in obstacle-rich environment indicates the high success rate with low average step of our method.

The dataset is then used to train 3 classification models to automatically classify the images into the relevant style which resulted in an accuracy of ~96%. With the rapid evolution of digital photography, we have seen new types of photography styles emerging at an exponential rate. On that account, we present a novel Siamese-based network that uses the trained classification models as the base architecture to adapt and classify unseen styles with only 25 training samples. We report an accuracy of over 68% for identifying 10 other distinct types of photography styles. This dataset can be found at https://trisha025.github.io/Photozilla/

**Abstract:** We address the problem of 3D shape registration and we propose a novel technique based on spectral graph theory and probabilistic matching. The task of 3D shape analysis involves tracking, recognition, registration, etc. Analyzing 3D data in a single framework is still a challenging task considering the large variability of the data gathered with different acquisition devices. 3D shape registration is one such challenging shape analysis task. The main contribution of this chapter is to extend the spectral graph matching methods to very large graphs by combining spectral graph matching with Laplacian embedding. Since the embedded representation of a graph is obtained by dimensionality reduction we claim that the existing spectral-based methods are not easily applicable. We discuss solutions for the exact and inexact graph isomorphism problems and recall the main spectral properties of the combinatorial graph Laplacian; We provide a novel analysis of the commute-time embedding that allows us to interpret the latter in terms of the PCA of a graph, and to select the appropriate dimension of the associated embedded metric space; We derive a unit hyper-sphere normalization for the commute-time embedding that allows us to register two shapes with different samplings; We propose a novel method to find the eigenvalue-eigenvector ordering and the eigenvector signs using the eigensignature (histogram) which is invariant to the isometric shape deformations and fits well in the spectral graph matching framework, and we present a probabilistic shape matching formulation using an expectation maximization point registration algorithm which alternates between aligning the eigenbases and finding a vertex-to-vertex assignment.

**Abstract:** Body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), like face-touching or skin-picking, are hand-driven behaviors which can damage one's appearance, if not identified early and treated. Technology for automatic detection is still under-explored, with few previous works being limited to wearables with single modalities (e.g., motion). Here, we propose a multi-sensory approach combining motion, orientation, and heart rate sensors to detect BFRBs. We conducted a feasibility study in which participants (N=10) were exposed to BFRBs-inducing tasks, and analyzed 380 mins of signals under an extensive evaluation of sensing modalities, cross-validation methods, and observation windows. Our models achieved an AUC > 0.90 in distinguishing BFRBs, which were more evident in observation windows 5 mins prior to the behavior as opposed to 1-min ones. In a follow-up qualitative survey, we found that not only the timing of detection matters but also models need to be context-aware, when designing just-in-time interventions to prevent BFRBs.

**Abstract:** Minimally invasive image-guided surgery heavily relies on vision. Deep learning models for surgical video analysis could therefore support visual tasks such as assessing the critical view of safety (CVS) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), potentially contributing to surgical safety and efficiency. However, the performance, reliability and reproducibility of such models are deeply dependent on the quality of data and annotations used in their development. Here, we present a protocol, checklists, and visual examples to promote consistent annotation of hepatocystic anatomy and CVS criteria. We believe that sharing annotation guidelines can help build trustworthy multicentric datasets for assessing generalizability of performance, thus accelerating the clinical translation of deep learning models for surgical video analysis.

**Abstract:** The unprecedented performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to large strides in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference tasks, such as object and speech recognition. Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity devices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple performance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high accuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the various embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to witness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms across consumer devices. In this paper, we provide preliminary answers to this potentially game-changing question by presenting an array of design techniques for efficient AI systems. We start by examining the major roadblocks when targeting both programmable processors and custom accelerators. Then, we present diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a cross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques, and their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems that do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can improve inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and FPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI applications, such as multi-DNN systems. Collectively, these results highlight the critical need for further exploration as to how the various cross-stack solutions can be best combined in order to bring the latest advances in deep learning close to users, in a robust and efficient manner.

**Abstract:** This paper studies construction of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction maps from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve traditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited amount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB. Therefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate response variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This increases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression function between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix convolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based AGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions retrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the same area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture characteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided generative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity. Further research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale and low-cost predictions of AGB.

**Abstract:** High resolution automotive radar sensors are required in order to meet the high bar of autonomous vehicles needs and regulations. However, current radar systems are limited in their angular resolution causing a technological gap. An industry and academic trend to improve angular resolution by increasing the number of physical channels, also increases system complexity, requires sensitive calibration processes, lowers robustness to hardware malfunctions and drives higher costs. We offer an alternative approach, named Radar signal Reconstruction using Self Supervision (R2-S2), which significantly improves the angular resolution of a given radar array without increasing the number of physical channels. R2-S2 is a family of algorithms which use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with complex range-Doppler radar data as input and trained in a self-supervised method using a loss function which operates in multiple data representation spaces. Improvement of 4x in angular resolution was demonstrated using a real-world dataset collected in urban and highway environments during clear and rainy weather conditions.

**Abstract:** Routing methods in capsule networks often learn a hierarchical relationship for capsules in successive layers, but the intra-relation between capsules in the same layer is less studied, while this intra-relation is a key factor for the semantic understanding in text data. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new capsule network with graph routing to learn both relationships, where capsules in each layer are treated as the nodes of a graph. We investigate strategies to yield adjacency and degree matrix with three different distances from a layer of capsules, and propose the graph routing mechanism between those capsules. We validate our approach on five text classification datasets, and our findings suggest that the approach combining bottom-up routing and top-down attention performs the best. Such an approach demonstrates generalization capability across datasets. Compared to the state-of-the-art routing methods, the improvements in accuracy in the five datasets we used were 0.82, 0.39, 0.07, 1.01, and 0.02, respectively.

**Abstract:** The author of this work proposes an overview of the recent semi-supervised learning approaches and related works. Despite the remarkable success of neural networks in various applications, there exist few formidable constraints including the need for a large amount of labeled data. Therefore, semi-supervised learning, which is a learning scheme in which the scarce labels and a larger amount of unlabeled data are utilized to train models (e.g., deep neural networks) is getting more important. Based on the key assumptions of semi-supervised learning, which are the manifold assumption, cluster assumption, and continuity assumption, the work reviews the recent semi-supervised learning approaches. In particular, the methods in regard to using deep neural networks in a semi-supervised learning setting are primarily discussed. In addition, the existing works are first classified based on the underlying idea and explained, and then the holistic approaches that unify the aforementioned ideas are detailed.

**Abstract:** Large machine learning models achieve unprecedented performance on various tasks and have evolved as the go-to technique. However, deploying these compute and memory hungry models on resource constraint environments poses new challenges. In this work, we propose mathematically provable Representer Sketch, a concise set of count arrays that can approximate the inference procedure with simple hashing computations and aggregations. Representer Sketch builds upon the popular Representer Theorem from kernel literature, hence the name, providing a generic fundamental alternative to the problem of efficient inference that goes beyond the popular approach such as quantization, iterative pruning and knowledge distillation. A neural network function is transformed to its weighted kernel density representation, which can be very efficiently estimated with our sketching algorithm. Empirically, we show that Representer Sketch achieves up to 114x reduction in storage requirement and 59x reduction in computation complexity without any drop in accuracy.

**Abstract:** In the text processing context, most ML models are built on word embeddings. These embeddings are themselves trained on some datasets, potentially containing sensitive data. In some cases this training is done independently, in other cases, it occurs as part of training a larger, task-specific model. In either case, it is of interest to consider membership inference attacks based on the embedding layer as a way of understanding sensitive information leakage. But, somewhat surprisingly, membership inference attacks on word embeddings and their effect in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks that use these embeddings, have remained relatively unexplored.
  In this work, we show that word embeddings are vulnerable to black-box membership inference attacks under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we show that this leakage persists through two other major NLP applications: classification and text-generation, even when the embedding layer is not exposed to the attacker. We show that our MI attack achieves high attack accuracy against a classifier model and an LSTM-based language model. Indeed, our attack is a cheaper membership inference attack on text-generative models, which does not require the knowledge of the target model or any expensive training of text-generative models as shadow models.

**Abstract:** Neural machine translation (NMT) is sensitive to domain shift. In this paper, we address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a given budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually fine-tune a pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing active learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty scores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even when only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To address this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based machine translation (PBMT) era that selected not full sentences, but rather individual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT systems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need to be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of sentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to select both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the new domain for routing to human translators. In a German-English translation task, our active learning approach achieves consistent improvements over uncertainty-based sentence selection methods, improving up to 1.2 BLEU score over strong active learning baselines.

**Abstract:** Speech Activity Detection (SAD), locating speech segments within an audio recording, is a main part of most speech technology applications. Robust SAD is usually more difficult in noisy conditions with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The Fearless Steps challenge has recently provided such data from the NASA Apollo-11 mission for different speech processing tasks including SAD. Most audio recordings are degraded by different kinds and levels of noise varying within and between channels. This paper describes the EML online algorithm for the most recent phase of this challenge. The proposed algorithm can be trained both in a supervised and unsupervised manner and assigns speech and non-speech labels at runtime approximately every 0.1 sec. The experimental results show a competitive accuracy on both development and evaluation datasets with a real-time factor of about 0.002 using a single CPU machine.

**Abstract:** Multi-armed bandits (MAB) provide a principled online learning approach to attain the balance between exploration and exploitation. Due to the superior performance and low feedback learning without the learning to act in multiple situations, Multi-armed Bandits drawing widespread attention in applications ranging such as recommender systems. Likewise, within the recommender system, collaborative filtering (CF) is arguably the earliest and most influential method in the recommender system. Crucially, new users and an ever-changing pool of recommended items are the challenges that recommender systems need to address. For collaborative filtering, the classical method is training the model offline, then perform the online testing, but this approach can no longer handle the dynamic changes in user preferences which is the so-called cold start. So how to effectively recommend items to users in the absence of effective information? To address the aforementioned problems, a multi-armed bandit based collaborative filtering recommender system has been proposed, named BanditMF. BanditMF is designed to address two challenges in the multi-armed bandits algorithm and collaborative filtering: (1) how to solve the cold start problem for collaborative filtering under the condition of scarcity of valid information, (2) how to solve the sub-optimal problem of bandit algorithms in strong social relations domains caused by independently estimating unknown parameters associated with each user and ignoring correlations between users.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel and unified Cycle in Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (C2GAN) for generating human faces, hands, bodies, and natural scenes. Our proposed C2GAN is a cross-modal model exploring the joint exploitation of the input image data and guidance data in an interactive manner. C2GAN contains two different generators, i.e., an image-generation generator and a guidance-generation generator. Both generators are mutually connected and trained in an end-to-end fashion and explicitly form three cycled subnets, i.e., one image generation cycle and two guidance generation cycles. Each cycle aims at reconstructing the input domain and simultaneously produces a useful output involved in the generation of another cycle. In this way, the cycles constrain each other implicitly providing complementary information from both image and guidance modalities and bringing an extra supervision gradient across the cycles, facilitating a more robust optimization of the whole model. Extensive results on four guided image-to-image translation subtasks demonstrate that the proposed C2GAN is effective in generating more realistic images compared with state-of-the-art models. The code is available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/C2GAN.

**Abstract:** The growing literature on "benign overfitting" in overparameterized models has been mostly restricted to regression or binary classification settings; however, most success stories of modern machine learning have been recorded in multiclass settings. Motivated by this discrepancy, we study benign overfitting in multiclass linear classification. Specifically, we consider the following popular training algorithms on separable data: (i) empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy loss, which converges to the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) solution; (ii) ERM with least-squares loss, which converges to the min-norm interpolating (MNI) solution; and, (iii) the one-vs-all SVM classifier. First, we provide a simple sufficient condition under which all three algorithms lead to classifiers that interpolate the training data and have equal accuracy. When the data is generated from Gaussian mixtures or a multinomial logistic model, this condition holds under high enough effective overparameterization. Second, we derive novel error bounds on the accuracy of the MNI classifier, thereby showing that all three training algorithms lead to benign overfitting under sufficient overparameterization. Ultimately, our analysis shows that good generalization is possible for SVM solutions beyond the realm in which typical margin-based bounds apply.

**Abstract:** To incorporate prior knowledge as well as measurement uncertainties in the traditional long short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, an efficient sparse Bayesian training algorithm is introduced to the network architecture. The proposed scheme automatically determines relevant neural connections and adapts accordingly, in contrast to the classical LSTM solution. Due to its flexibility, the new LSTM scheme is less prone to overfitting, and hence can approximate time dependent solutions by use of a smaller data set. On a structural nonlinear finite element application we show that the self-regulating framework does not require prior knowledge of a suitable network architecture and size, while ensuring satisfying accuracy at reasonable computational cost.

**Abstract:** Kernel segmentation aims at partitioning a data sequence into several non-overlapping segments that may have nonlinear and complex structures. In general, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial constraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic programming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements. Given that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a practical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to approximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of their solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based regularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining it with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a differentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization (KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the optimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed model. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower time and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform segmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting multiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to further introduce an extended variant of the proposed model. Through extensive experiments on various types of data sequences performances of our models are evaluated and compared with those of the existing methods. The experimental results validate advantages of the proposed models. Our Matlab source code is available on github.

**Abstract:** There have been many recent advances on provably efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) in problems with rich observation spaces. However, all these works share a strong realizability assumption about the optimal value function of the true MDP. Such realizability assumptions are often too strong to hold in practice. In this work, we consider the more realistic setting of agnostic RL with rich observation spaces and a fixed class of policies $Œ†$ that may not contain any near-optimal policy. We provide an algorithm for this setting whose error is bounded in terms of the rank $d$ of the underlying MDP. Specifically, our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}\left((H^{4d} K^{3d} \log |Œ†|)/Œµ^2\right)$ where $H$ is the length of episodes, $K$ is the number of actions and $Œµ>0$ is the desired sub-optimality. We also provide a nearly matching lower bound for this agnostic setting that shows that the exponential dependence on rank is unavoidable, without further assumptions.

**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam, have achieved tremendous success in machine learning. Scaling gradients by square roots of the running averages of squared past gradients, such methods are able to attain rapid training of modern deep neural networks. Nevertheless, they are observed to generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and tend to be trapped in local minima at an early stage during training. Intriguingly, we discover that substituting the gradient in the second moment estimation term with the momentumized version in Adam can well solve the issues. The intuition is that gradient with momentum contains more accurate directional information and therefore its second moment estimation is a better choice for scaling than that of the raw gradient. Thereby we propose AdaMomentum as a new optimizer reaching the goal of training fast while generalizing better. We further develop a theory to back up the improvement in optimization and generalization and provide convergence guarantees under both convex and nonconvex settings. Extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks and models demonstrate that AdaMomentum exhibits state-of-the-art performance consistently.

We give such a generalization based on  concept of program equilibria, and point out that that a practically relevant generalization may not exist.  To remedy this we propose some general, intuitive, computationally tractable, other-regarding equilibria that are special cases Kantian equilibria, as well as a class of courses of action that interpolates between purely self-regarding and Kantian behavior.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a physics-constrained deep neural network (PCDNN) method for parameter estimation in the zero-dimensional (0D) model of the vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). In this approach, we use deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate the model parameters as functions of the operating conditions. This method allows the integration of the VRFB computational models as the physical constraints in the parameter learning process, leading to enhanced accuracy of parameter estimation and cell voltage prediction. Using an experimental dataset, we demonstrate that the PCDNN method can estimate model parameters for a range of operating conditions and improve the 0D model prediction of voltage compared to the 0D model prediction with constant operation-condition-independent parameters estimated with traditional inverse methods. We also demonstrate that the PCDNN approach has an improved generalization ability for estimating parameter values for operating conditions not used in the DNN training.

**Abstract:** Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a crucial task for the Autonomous Driving pipeline. MOD is usually handled via 2-stream convolutional architectures that incorporates both appearance and motion cues, without considering the inter-relations between the spatial or motion features. In this paper, we tackle this problem through multi-head attention mechanisms, both across the spatial and motion streams. We propose MODETR; a Moving Object DEtection TRansformer network, comprised of multi-stream transformer encoders for both spatial and motion modalities, and an object transformer decoder that produces the moving objects bounding boxes using set predictions. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end using bi-partite loss. Several methods of incorporating motion cues with the Transformer model are explored, including two-stream RGB and Optical Flow (OF) methods, and multi-stream architectures that take advantage of sequence information. To incorporate the temporal information, we propose a new Temporal Positional Encoding (TPE) approach to extend the Spatial Positional Encoding(SPE) in DETR. We explore two architectural choices for that, balancing between speed and time. To evaluate the our network, we perform the MOD task on the KITTI MOD [6] data set. Results show significant 5% mAP of the Transformer network for MOD over the state-of-the art methods. Moreover, the proposed TPE encoding provides 10% mAP improvement over the SPE baseline.

**Abstract:** Moving objects have special importance for Autonomous Driving tasks. Detecting moving objects can be posed as Moving Object Segmentation, by segmenting the object pixels, or Moving Object Detection, by generating a bounding box for the moving targets. In this paper, we present a Multi-Task Learning architecture, based on Transformers, to jointly perform both tasks through one network. Due to the importance of the motion features to the task, the whole setup is based on a Spatio-Temporal aggregation. We evaluate the performance of the individual tasks architecture versus the MTL setup, both with early shared encoders, and late shared encoder-decoder transformers. For the latter, we present a novel joint tasks query decoder transformer, that enables us to have tasks dedicated heads out of the shared model. To evaluate our approach, we use the KITTI MOD [29] data set. Results show1.5% mAP improvement for Moving Object Detection, and 2%IoU improvement for Moving Object Segmentation, over the individual tasks networks.

**Abstract:** Bilevel optimization recently has attracted increased interest in machine learning due to its many applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and policy optimization. Although some methods recently have been proposed to solve the bilevel problems, these methods do not consider using adaptive learning rates. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a class of fast and effective adaptive methods for solving bilevel optimization problems that the outer problem is possibly nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly-convex. Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop BiAdam algorithm based on the basic momentum technique, which achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(Œµ^{-4})$ for finding an $Œµ$-stationary point. At the same time, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam) by using variance reduced technique, which reaches the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(Œµ^{-3})$. To further reduce computation in estimating derivatives, we propose a fast single-loop stochastic approximated BiAdam algorithm (saBiAdam) by avoiding the Hessian inverse, which still achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(Œµ^{-4})$ without large batches. We further present an accelerated version of saBiAdam algorithm (VR-saBiAdam), which also reaches the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(Œµ^{-3})$. We apply the unified adaptive matrices to our methods as the SUPER-ADAM \citep{huang2021super}, which including many types of adaptive learning rates. Moreover, our framework can flexibly use the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we provide a useful convergence analysis framework for both the constrained and unconstrained bilevel optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel optimization methods with adaptive learning rates.

**Abstract:** Involving humans directly for the benefit of AI agents' training is getting traction thanks to several advances in reinforcement learning and human-in-the-loop learning. Humans can provide rewards to the agent, demonstrate tasks, design a curriculum, or act in the environment, but these benefits also come with architectural, functional design and engineering complexities. We present Cogment, a unifying open-source framework that introduces an actor formalism to support a variety of humans-agents collaboration typologies and training approaches. It is also scalable out of the box thanks to a distributed micro service architecture, and offers solutions to the aforementioned complexities.

**Abstract:** Transfer learning is critical for efficient information transfer across multiple related learning problems. A simple, yet effective transfer learning approach utilizes deep neural networks trained on a large-scale task for feature extraction. Such representations are then used to learn related downstream tasks. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning capacity of audio representations obtained from neural networks trained on a large-scale sound event detection dataset. We build and evaluate these representations across a wide range of other audio tasks, via a simple linear classifier transfer mechanism. We show that such simple linear transfer is already powerful enough to achieve high performance on the downstream tasks. We also provide insights into the attributes of sound event representations that enable such efficient information transfer.

**Abstract:** Person detection is a crucial task for mobile robots navigating in human-populated environments and LiDAR sensors are promising for this task, given their accurate depth measurements and large field of view. This paper studies existing LiDAR-based person detectors with a particular focus on mobile robot scenarios (e.g. service robot or social robot), where persons are observed more frequently and in much closer ranges, compared to the driving scenarios. We conduct a series of experiments, using the recently released JackRabbot dataset and the state-of-the-art detectors based on 3D or 2D LiDAR sensors (CenterPoint and DR-SPAAM respectively). These experiments revolve around the domain gap between driving and mobile robot scenarios, as well as the modality gap between 3D and 2D LiDAR sensors. For the domain gap, we aim to understand if detectors pretrained on driving datasets can achieve good performance on the mobile robot scenarios, for which there are currently no trained models readily available. For the modality gap, we compare detectors that use 3D or 2D LiDAR, from various aspects, including performance, runtime, localization accuracy, robustness to range and crowdedness. The results from our experiments provide practical insights into LiDAR-based person detection and facilitate informed decisions for relevant mobile robot designs and applications.

**Abstract:** Pre-training has enabled state-of-the-art results on many tasks. In spite of its recognized contribution to generalization, we observed in this study that pre-training also transfers adversarial non-robustness from pre-trained model into fine-tuned model in the downstream tasks. Using image classification as an example, we first conducted experiments on various datasets and network backbones to uncover the adversarial non-robustness in fine-tuned model. Further analysis was conducted on examining the learned knowledge of fine-tuned model and standard model, and revealed that the reason leading to the non-robustness is the non-robust features transferred from pre-trained model. Finally, we analyzed the preference for feature learning of the pre-trained model, explored the factors influencing robustness, and introduced a simple robust pre-traning solution.

**Abstract:** The performance of image classification methodsheavily relies on the high-quality annotations, which are noteasily affordable, particularly for medical data. To alleviate thislimitation, in this study, we propose a weakly supervised imageclassification method based on combination of hand-craftedfeatures. We hypothesize that integration of these hand-craftedfeatures alongside Long short-term memory (LSTM) classifiercan reduce the adverse effects of weak labels in classificationaccuracy. Our proposed algorithm is based on selecting theappropriate domain representations of the data in Wavelet andDiscrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domains. This informationis then fed into LSTM network to account for the sequentialnature of the data. The proposed efficient, low dimensionalfeatures exploit the power of shallow deep learning modelsto achieve higher performance with lower computational cost.In order to show efficacy of the proposed strategy, we haveexperimented classification of brain tumor grades and achievedthe state of the art performance with the resolution of 256 x 256. We also conducted a comprehensive set of experiments toanalyze the effect of each component on the performance.

**Abstract:** The paper researches the problem of concept and patient representations in the medical domain. We present the patient histories from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as temporal sequences of ICD concepts for which embeddings are learned in an unsupervised setup with a transformer-based neural network model. The model training was performed on the collection of one million patients' histories in 6 years. The predictive power of such a model is assessed in comparison with several baseline methods. A series of experiments on the MIMIC-III data show the advantage of the presented model compared to a similar system. Further, we analyze the obtained embedding space with regards to concept relations and show how knowledge from the medical domain can be successfully transferred to the practical task of insurance scoring in the form of patient embeddings.

**Abstract:** Cybersecurity is a domain where there is constant change in patterns of attack, and we need ways to make our Cybersecurity systems more adaptive to handle new attacks and categorize for appropriate action. We present a novel approach to handle the alarm flooding problem faced by Cybersecurity systems like security information and event management (SIEM) and intrusion detection (IDS). We apply a zero-shot learning method to machine learning (ML) by leveraging explanations for predictions of anomalies generated by a ML model. This approach has huge potential to auto detect alarm labels generated in SIEM and associate them with specific attack types. In this approach, without any prior knowledge of attack, we try to identify it, decipher the features that contribute to classification and try to bucketize the attack in a specific category - using explainable AI. Explanations give us measurable factors as to what features influence the prediction of a cyber-attack and to what degree. These explanations generated based on game-theory are used to allocate credit to specific features based on their influence on a specific prediction. Using this allocation of credit, we propose a novel zero-shot approach to categorize novel attacks into specific new classes based on feature influence. The resulting system demonstrated will get good at separating attack traffic from normal flow and auto-generate a label for attacks based on features that contribute to the attack. These auto-generated labels can be presented to SIEM analyst and are intuitive enough to figure out the nature of attack. We apply this approach to a network flow dataset and demonstrate results for specific attack types like ip sweep, denial of service, remote to local, etc.

**Abstract:** A typical part of learning to play the piano is the progression through a series of practice units that focus on individual dimensions of the skill, such as hand coordination, correct posture, or correct timing. Ideally, a focus on a particular practice method should be made in a way to maximize the learner's progress in learning to play the piano. Because we each learn differently, and because there are many choices for possible piano practice tasks and methods, the set of practice tasks should be dynamically adapted to the human learner. However, having a human teacher guide individual practice is not always feasible since it is time consuming, expensive, and not always available. Instead, we suggest to optimize in the space of practice methods, the so-called practice modes. The proposed optimization process takes into account the skills of the individual learner and their history of learning. In this work we present a modeling framework to guide the human learner through the learning process by choosing practice modes that have the highest expected utility (i.e., improvement in piano playing skill). To this end, we propose a human learner utility model based on a Gaussian process, and exemplify the model training and its application for practice scaffolding on an example of simulated human learners.

**Abstract:** In an interactive belief model, are the players "commonly meta-certain" of the model itself? This paper formalizes such implicit "common meta-certainty" assumption. To that end, the paper expands the objects of players' beliefs from events to functions defined on the underlying states. Then, the paper defines a player's belief-generating map: it associates, with each state, whether a player believes each event at that state. The paper formalizes what it means by: "a player is (meta-)certain of her own belief-generating map" or "the players are (meta-)certain of the profile of belief-generating maps (i.e., the model)." The paper shows: a player is (meta-)certain of her own belief-generating map if and only if her beliefs are introspective. The players are commonly (meta-)certain of the model if and only if, for any event which some player i believes at some state, it is common belief at the state that player i believes the event. This paper then asks whether the "common meta-certainty" assumption is needed for an epistemic characterization of game-theoretic solution concepts. The paper shows: if each player is logical and (meta-)certain of her own strategy and belief-generating map, then each player correctly believes her own rationality. Consequently, common belief in rationality alone leads to actions that survive iterated elimination of strictly dominated actions.

**Abstract:** This paper develops an efficient procedure for designing low-complexity codebooks for precoding in a full-dimension (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with a uniform planar array (UPA) antenna at the transmitter (Tx) using tensor learning. In particular, instead of using statistical channel models, we utilize a model-free data-driven approach with foundations in machine learning to generate codebooks that adapt to the surrounding propagation conditions. We use a tensor representation of the FD-MIMO channel and exploit its properties to design quantized version of the channel precoders. We find the best representation of the optimal precoder as a function of Kronecker Product (KP) of two low-dimensional precoders, respectively corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the UPA, obtained from the tensor decomposition of the channel. We then quantize this precoder to design product codebooks such that an average loss in mutual information due to quantization of channel state information (CSI) is minimized. The key technical contribution lies in exploiting the constraints on the precoders to reduce the product codebook design problem to an unsupervised clustering problem on a Cartesian Product Grassmann manifold (CPM), where the cluster centroids form a finite-sized precoder codebook. This codebook can be found efficiently by running a $K$-means clustering on the CPM. With a suitable induced distance metric on the CPM, we show that the construction of product codebooks is equivalent to finding the optimal set of centroids on the factor manifolds corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed design criterion in learning the codebooks and the attractive performance of the designed codebooks.

**Abstract:** Accurate liver and lesion segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images are highly demanded in clinical practice for assisting the diagnosis and assessment of hepatic tumor disease. However, automatic liver and lesion segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT volumes is extremely challenging due to the diversity in contrast, resolution, and quality of images. Previous methods based on UNet for 2D slice-by-slice or 3D volume-by-volume segmentation either lack sufficient spatial contexts or suffer from high GPU computational cost, which limits the performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel context-aware PolyUNet for accurate liver and lesion segmentation. It jointly explores structural diversity and consecutive t-adjacent slices to enrich feature expressive power and spatial contextual information while avoiding the overload of GPU memory consumption. In addition, we utilize zoom out/in and two-stage refinement strategy to exclude the irrelevant contexts and focus on the specific region for the fine-grained segmentation. Our method achieved very competitive performance at the MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge among all tasks with a single model and ranked the $3^{rd}$, $12^{th}$, $2^{nd}$, and $5^{th}$ places in the liver segmentation, lesion segmentation, lesion detection, and tumor burden estimation, respectively.

**Abstract:** With the emerging of 360-degree image/video, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), the demand for analysing and processing spherical signals get tremendous increase. However, plenty of effort paid on planar signals that projected from spherical signals, which leading to some problems, e.g. waste of pixels, distortion. Recent advances in spherical CNN have opened up the possibility of directly analysing spherical signals. However, they pay attention to the full mesh which makes it infeasible to deal with situations in real-world application due to the extremely large bandwidth requirement. To address the bandwidth waste problem associated with 360-degree video streaming and save computation, we exploit Focused Icosahedral Mesh to represent a small area and construct matrices to rotate spherical content to the focused mesh area. We also proposed a novel VertexShuffle operation that can significantly improve both the performance and the efficiency compared to the original MeshConv Transpose operation introduced in UGSCNN. We further apply our proposed methods on super resolution model, which is the first to propose a spherical super-resolution model that directly operates on a mesh representation of spherical pixels of 360-degree data. To evaluate our model, we also collect a set of high-resolution 360-degree videos to generate a spherical image dataset. Our experiments indicate that our proposed spherical super-resolution model achieves significant benefits in terms of both performance and inference time compared to the baseline spherical super-resolution model that uses the simple MeshConv Transpose operation. In summary, our model achieves great super-resolution performance on 360-degree inputs, achieving 32.79 dB PSNR on average when super-resoluting 16x vertices on the mesh.

**Abstract:** Cataract surgery is a sight saving surgery that is performed over 10 million times each year around the world. With such a large demand, the ability to organize surgical wards and operating rooms efficiently is critical to delivery this therapy in routine clinical care. In this context, estimating the remaining surgical duration (RSD) during procedures is one way to help streamline patient throughput and workflows. To this end, we propose CataNet, a method for cataract surgeries that predicts in real time the RSD jointly with two influential elements: the surgeon's experience, and the current phase of the surgery. We compare CataNet to state-of-the-art RSD estimation methods, showing that it outperforms them even when phase and experience are not considered. We investigate this improvement and show that a significant contributor is the way we integrate the elapsed time into CataNet's feature extractor.

**Abstract:** Quality control (QC) in medical image analysis is time-consuming and laborious, leading to increased interest in automated methods. However, what is deemed suitable quality for algorithmic processing may be different from human-perceived measures of visual quality. In this work, we pose MR image quality assessment from an image reconstruction perspective. We train Bayesian CNNs using a heteroscedastic uncertainty model to recover clean images from noisy data, providing measures of uncertainty over the predictions. This framework enables us to divide data corruption into learnable and non-learnable components and leads us to interpret the predictive uncertainty as an estimation of the achievable recovery of an image. Thus, we argue that quality control for visual assessment cannot be equated to quality control for algorithmic processing. We validate this statement in a multi-task experiment combining artefact recovery with uncertainty prediction and grey matter segmentation. Recognising this distinction between visual and algorithmic quality has the impact that, depending on the downstream task, less data can be excluded based on ``visual quality" reasons alone.

**Abstract:** Although Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) has become the mainstream paradigm in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) due to its simplicity and efficiency, more recent works found that the performance of the searched architecture barely increases with the optimization proceeding in DARTS, and the final magnitudes obtained by DARTS could hardly indicate the importance of operations. The above observation reveal that the supervision signal in DARTS may be a poor or unreliable indicator for the architecture search, inspiring an interesting and promising direction: can we measure the operation importance without any training under the differentiable paradigm? We provide an affirmative answer by customizing the NAS as a network pruning at initialization problem. With leveraging recently-proposed synaptic saliency criteria in the network pruning at initialization, we seek to score the importance of candidate operations in differentiable NAS without any training, and proposed a novel framework called \textit{training free differentiable architecture search} (FreeDARTS) accordingly. We show that, without any training, FreeDARTS with different proxy metrics can outperform most NAS baselines in different search spaces. More importantly, FreeDARTS is extremely memory-efficient and computational-efficient as it abandons the training in the architecture search phase, enabling FreeDARTS to perform architecture search on a more flexible space and eliminate the depth gap between architecture search and evaluation. We hope our work inspires more attempts in solving NAS from the perspective of pruning at initialization.

**Abstract:** Trajectory prediction of vehicles in city-scale road networks is of great importance to various location-based applications such as vehicle navigation, traffic management, and location-based recommendations. Existing methods typically represent a trajectory as a sequence of grid cells, road segments or intention sets. None of them is ideal, as the cell-based representation ignores the road network structures and the other two are less efficient in analyzing city-scale road networks. Moreover, previous models barely leverage spatial dependencies or only consider them at the grid cell level, ignoring the non-Euclidean spatial structure shaped by irregular road networks. To address these problems, we propose a network-based vehicle trajectory prediction model named NetTraj, which represents each trajectory as a sequence of intersections and associated movement directions, and then feeds them into a LSTM encoder-decoder network for future trajectory generation. Furthermore, we introduce a local graph attention mechanism to capture network-level spatial dependencies of trajectories, and a temporal attention mechanism with a sliding context window to capture both short- and long-term temporal dependencies in trajectory data. Extensive experiments based on two real-world large-scale taxi trajectory datasets show that NetTraj outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for vehicle trajectory prediction, validating the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory representation method and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms.

We prove the correctness of this compilation, for the defeasible logic $DL(\partial_{||})$, but the techniques we use apply to many other defeasible logics. Structural properties of $DL(\partial_{||})$ are identified that support efficient implementation and/or approximation of the conclusions of defeasible theories in the logic, compared with other defeasible logics. We also use previously well-studied structural properties of logic programs to adapt to incomplete Datalog$^\neg$ implementations.
