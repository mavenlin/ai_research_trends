**Abstract:** Prompted models have demonstrated impressive few-shot learning abilities. Repeated interactions at test-time with a single model, or the composition of multiple models together, further expands capabilities. These compositions are probabilistic models, and may be expressed in the language of graphical models with random variables whose values are complex data types such as strings. Cases with control flow and dynamic structure require techniques from probabilistic programming, which allow implementing disparate model structures and inference strategies in a unified language. We formalize several existing techniques from this perspective, including scratchpads / chain of thought, verifiers, STaR, selection-inference, and tool use. We refer to the resulting programs as language model cascades.

**Abstract:** Given a programming problem, pre-trained language models such as Codex have demonstrated the ability to generate multiple different code solutions via sampling. However, selecting a correct or best solution from those samples still remains a challenge. While an easy way to verify the correctness of a code solution is through executing test cases, producing high-quality test cases is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we explore the use of pre-trained language models to automatically generate test cases, calling our method CodeT: Code generation with generated Tests. CodeT executes the code solutions using the generated test cases, and then chooses the best solution based on a dual execution agreement with both the generated test cases and other generated solutions. We evaluate CodeT on five different pre-trained models with both HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate CodeT can achieve significant, consistent, and surprising improvements over previous methods. For example, CodeT improves the pass@1 on HumanEval to 65.8%, an increase of absolute 18.8% on the code-davinci-002 model, and an absolute 20+% improvement over previous state-of-the-art results.

**Abstract:** Our theoretical understanding of deep learning has not kept pace with its empirical success. While network architecture is known to be critical, we do not yet understand its effect on learned representations and network behavior, or how this architecture should reflect task structure.In this work, we begin to address this gap by introducing the Gated Deep Linear Network framework that schematizes how pathways of information flow impact learning dynamics within an architecture. Crucially, because of the gating, these networks can compute nonlinear functions of their input. We derive an exact reduction and, for certain cases, exact solutions to the dynamics of learning. Our analysis demonstrates that the learning dynamics in structured networks can be conceptualized as a neural race with an implicit bias towards shared representations, which then govern the model's ability to systematically generalize, multi-task, and transfer. We validate our key insights on naturalistic datasets and with relaxed assumptions. Taken together, our work gives rise to general hypotheses relating neural architecture to learning and provides a mathematical approach towards understanding the design of more complex architectures and the role of modularity and compositionality in solving real-world problems.

<p>

**Abstract:** What is really needed to make an existing 2D GAN 3D-aware? To answer this question, we modify a classical GAN, i.e., StyleGANv2, as little as possible. We find that only two modifications are absolutely necessary: 1) a multiplane image style generator branch which produces a set of alpha maps conditioned on their depth; 2) a pose-conditioned discriminator. We refer to the generated output as a 'generative multiplane image' (GMPI) and emphasize that its renderings are not only high-quality but also guaranteed to be view-consistent, which makes GMPIs different from many prior works. Importantly, the number of alpha maps can be dynamically adjusted and can differ between training and inference, alleviating memory concerns and enabling fast training of GMPIs in less than half a day at a resolution of $1024^2$. Our findings are consistent across three challenging and common high-resolution datasets, including FFHQ, AFHQv2, and MetFaces.

**Abstract:** We present a new benchmark dataset, Sapsucker Woods 60 (SSW60), for advancing research on audiovisual fine-grained categorization. While our community has made great strides in fine-grained visual categorization on images, the counterparts in audio and video fine-grained categorization are relatively unexplored. To encourage advancements in this space, we have carefully constructed the SSW60 dataset to enable researchers to experiment with classifying the same set of categories in three different modalities: images, audio, and video. The dataset covers 60 species of birds and is comprised of images from existing datasets, and brand new, expert-curated audio and video datasets. We thoroughly benchmark audiovisual classification performance and modality fusion experiments through the use of state-of-the-art transformer methods. Our findings show that performance of audiovisual fusion methods is better than using exclusively image or audio based methods for the task of video classification. We also present interesting modality transfer experiments, enabled by the unique construction of SSW60 to encompass three different modalities. We hope the SSW60 dataset and accompanying baselines spur research in this fascinating area.

**Abstract:** Humans possess an innate ability to identify and differentiate instances that they are not familiar with, by leveraging and adapting the knowledge that they have acquired so far. Importantly, they achieve this without deteriorating the performance on their earlier learning. Inspired by this, we identify and formulate a new, pragmatic problem setting of NCDwF: Novel Class Discovery without Forgetting, which tasks a machine learning model to incrementally discover novel categories of instances from unlabeled data, while maintaining its performance on the previously seen categories. We propose 1) a method to generate pseudo-latent representations which act as a proxy for (no longer available) labeled data, thereby alleviating forgetting, 2) a mutual-information based regularizer which enhances unsupervised discovery of novel classes, and 3) a simple Known Class Identifier which aids generalized inference when the testing data contains instances form both seen and unseen categories. We introduce experimental protocols based on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1000 to measure the trade-off between knowledge retention and novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations reveal that existing models catastrophically forget previously seen categories while identifying novel categories, while our method is able to effectively balance between the competing objectives. We hope our work will attract further research into this newly identified pragmatic problem setting.

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks contain strong priors for generating natural looking images [1]. These priors enable image denoising, super resolution, and inpainting in an unsupervised manner. Previous attempts to demonstrate similar ideas in audio, namely deep audio priors, (i) use hand picked architectures such as harmonic convolutions, (ii) only work with spectrogram input, and (iii) have been used mostly for eliminating Gaussian noise [2]. In this work we show that existing SOTA architectures for audio source separation contain deep priors even when working with the raw waveform. Deep priors can be discovered by training a neural network to generate a single corrupted signal when given white noise as input. A network with relevant deep priors is likely to generate a cleaner version of the signal before converging on the corrupted signal. We demonstrate this restoration effect with several corruptions: background noise, reverberations, and a gap in the signal (audio inpainting).

**Abstract:** Real-world behavior is often shaped by complex interactions between multiple agents. To scalably study multi-agent behavior, advances in unsupervised and self-supervised learning have enabled a variety of different behavioral representations to be learned from trajectory data. To date, there does not exist a unified set of benchmarks that can enable comparing methods quantitatively and systematically across a broad set of behavior analysis settings. We aim to address this by introducing a large-scale, multi-agent trajectory dataset from real-world behavioral neuroscience experiments that covers a range of behavior analysis tasks. Our dataset consists of trajectory data from common model organisms, with 9.6 million frames of mouse data and 4.4 million frames of fly data, in a variety of experimental settings, such as different strains, lengths of interaction, and optogenetic stimulation. A subset of the frames also consist of expert-annotated behavior labels. Improvements on our dataset corresponds to behavioral representations that work across multiple organisms and is able to capture differences for common behavior analysis tasks.

**Abstract:** Topological data analysis (TDA) is a tool from data science and mathematics that is beginning to make waves in environmental science. In this work, we seek to provide an intuitive and understandable introduction to a tool from TDA that is particularly useful for the analysis of imagery, namely persistent homology. We briefly discuss the theoretical background but focus primarily on understanding the output of this tool and discussing what information it can glean. To this end, we frame our discussion around a guiding example of classifying satellite images from the Sugar, Fish, Flower, and Gravel Dataset produced for the study of mesocale organization of clouds by Rasp et. al. in 2020 (arXiv:1906:01906). We demonstrate how persistent homology and its vectorization, persistence landscapes, can be used in a workflow with a simple machine learning algorithm to obtain good results, and explore in detail how we can explain this behavior in terms of image-level features. One of the core strengths of persistent homology is how interpretable it can be, so throughout this paper we discuss not just the patterns we find, but why those results are to be expected given what we know about the theory of persistent homology. Our goal is that a reader of this paper will leave with a better understanding of TDA and persistent homology, be able to identify problems and datasets of their own for which persistent homology could be helpful, and gain an understanding of results they obtain from applying the included GitHub example code.

**Abstract:** Using Bayes's theorem, we derive a unit-wise recurrence as well as a backward recursion similar to the forward-backward algorithm. The resulting Bayesian recurrent units can be integrated as recurrent neural networks within deep learning frameworks, while retaining a probabilistic interpretation from the direct correspondence with hidden Markov models. Whilst the contribution is mainly theoretical, experiments on speech recognition indicate that adding the derived units at the end of state-of-the-art recurrent architectures can improve the performance at a very low cost in terms of trainable parameters.

**Abstract:** The usage of chemical imaging technologies is becoming a routine accompaniment to traditional methods in pathology. Significant technological advances have developed these next generation techniques to provide rich, spatially resolved, multidimensional chemical images. The rise of digital pathology has significantly enhanced the synergy of these imaging modalities with optical microscopy and immunohistochemistry, enhancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms and progression of diseases. Techniques such as imaging mass cytometry provide labelled multidimensional (multiplex) images of specific components used in conjunction with digital pathology techniques. These powerful techniques generate a wealth of high dimensional data that create significant challenges in data analysis. Unsupervised methods such as clustering are an attractive way to analyse these data, however, they require the selection of parameters such as the number of clusters. Here we propose a methodology to estimate the number of clusters in an automatic data-driven manner using a deep sparse autoencoder to embed the data into a lower dimensional space. We compute the density of regions in the embedded space, the majority of which are empty, enabling the high density regions to be detected as outliers and provide an estimate for the number of clusters. This framework provides a fully unsupervised and data-driven method to analyse multidimensional data. In this work we demonstrate our method using 45 multiplex imaging mass cytometry datasets. Moreover, our model is trained using only one of the datasets and the learned embedding is applied to the remaining 44 images providing an efficient process for data analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the high computational efficiency of our method which is two orders of magnitude faster than estimating via computing the sum squared distances as a function of cluster number.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose a penalized nonparametric approach to estimating the quantile regression process (QRP) in a nonseparable model using rectifier quadratic unit (ReQU) activated deep neural networks and introduce a novel penalty function to enforce non-crossing of quantile regression curves. We establish the non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for the estimated QRP and derive the mean integrated squared error for the estimated QRP under mild smoothness and regularity conditions. To establish these non-asymptotic risk and estimation error bounds, we also develop a new error bound for approximating $C^s$ smooth functions with $s >0$ and their derivatives using ReQU activated neural networks. This is a new approximation result for ReQU networks and is of independent interest and may be useful in other problems. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with or outperforms two existing methods, including methods using reproducing kernels and random forests, for nonparametric quantile regression.

**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate architecture design processes and improve the performance of deep neural networks. Platform-aware NAS methods consider both performance and complexity and can find well-performing architectures with low computational resources. Although ordinary NAS methods result in tremendous computational costs owing to the repetition of model training, one-shot NAS, which trains the weights of a supernetwork containing all candidate architectures only once during the search process, has been reported to result in a lower search cost. This study focuses on the architecture complexity-aware one-shot NAS that optimizes the objective function composed of the weighted sum of two metrics, such as the predictive performance and number of parameters. In existing methods, the architecture search process must be run multiple times with different coefficients of the weighted sum to obtain multiple architectures with different complexities. This study aims at reducing the search cost associated with finding multiple architectures. The proposed method uses multiple distributions to generate architectures with different complexities and updates each distribution using the samples obtained from multiple distributions based on importance sampling. The proposed method allows us to obtain multiple architectures with different complexities in a single architecture search, resulting in reducing the search cost. The proposed method is applied to the architecture search of convolutional neural networks on the CIAFR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Consequently, compared with baseline methods, the proposed method finds multiple architectures with varying complexities while requiring less computational effort.

**Abstract:** As electro-optical energy from the sun propagates through the atmosphere it is affected by radiative transfer effects including absorption, emission, and scattering. Modeling these affects is essential for scientific remote sensing measurements of the earth and atmosphere. For example, hyperspectral imagery is a form of digital imagery collected with many, often hundreds, of wavelengths of light in pixel. The amount of light measured at the sensor is the result of emitted sunlight, atmospheric radiative transfer, and the reflectance off the materials on the ground, all of which vary per wavelength resulting from multiple physical phenomena. Therefore measurements of the ground spectra or atmospheric constituents requires separating these different contributions per wavelength. In this paper, we create an autoencoder similar to denoising autoencoders treating the atmospheric affects as 'noise' and ground reflectance as truth per spectrum. We generate hundreds of thousands of training samples by taking random samples of spectra from laboratory measurements and adding atmospheric affects using physics-based modelling via MODTRAN (http://modtran.spectral.com/modtran\_home) by varying atmospheric inputs. This process ideally could create an autoencoder that would separate atmospheric effects and ground reflectance in hyperspectral imagery, a process called atmospheric compensation which is difficult and time-consuming requiring a combination of heuristic approximations, estimates of physical quantities, and physical modelling. While the accuracy of our method is not as good as other methods in the field, this an important first step in applying the growing field of deep learning of physical principles to atmospheric compensation in hyperspectral imagery and remote sensing.

**Abstract:** In this paper we investigate neural networks for classification in hyperspectral imaging with a focus on connecting the architecture of the network with the physics of the sensing and materials present. Spectroscopy is the process of measuring light reflected or emitted by a material as a function wavelength. Molecular bonds present in the material have vibrational frequencies which affect the amount of light measured at each wavelength. Thus the measured spectrum contains information about the particular chemical constituents and types of bonds. For example, chlorophyll reflects more light in the near-IR rage (800-900nm) than in the red (625-675nm) range, and this difference can be measured using a normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI), which is commonly used to detect vegetation presence, health, and type in imagery collected at these wavelengths. In this paper we show that the weights in a Neural Network trained on different vegetation classes learn to measure this difference in reflectance. We then show that a Neural Network trained on a more complex set of ten different polymer materials will learn spectral 'features' evident in the weights for the network, and these features can be used to reliably distinguish between the different types of polymers. Examination of the weights provides a human-interpretable understanding of the network.

**Abstract:** At the center of the underlying issues that halt Indonesian natural language processing (NLP) research advancement, we find data scarcity. Resources in Indonesian languages, especially the local ones, are extremely scarce and underrepresented. Many Indonesian researchers do not publish their dataset. Furthermore, the few public datasets that we have are scattered across different platforms, thus makes performing reproducible and data-centric research in Indonesian NLP even more arduous. Rising to this challenge, we initiate the first Indonesian NLP crowdsourcing effort, NusaCrowd. NusaCrowd strives to provide the largest datasheets aggregation with standardized data loading for NLP tasks in all Indonesian languages. By enabling open and centralized access to Indonesian NLP resources, we hope NusaCrowd can tackle the data scarcity problem hindering NLP progress in Indonesia and bring NLP practitioners to move towards collaboration.

**Abstract:** Among random sampling methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are foremost. Using a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we study their convergence properties towards the steady state, within a random walk Metropolis scheme. We show that the deviations from the target steady-state distribution feature a localization transition as a function of the characteristic length of the attempted jumps defining the random walk. This transition changes drastically the error which is introduced by incomplete convergence, and discriminates two regimes where the relaxation mechanism is limited respectively by diffusion and by rejection.

**Abstract:** Closed-loop reservoir management (CLRM), in which history matching and production optimization are performed multiple times over the life of an asset, can provide significant improvement in the specified objective. These procedures are computationally expensive due to the large number of flow simulations required for data assimilation and optimization. Existing CLRM procedures are applied asset by asset, without utilizing information that could be useful over a range assets. Here, we develop a CLRM framework for multiple assets with varying numbers of wells. We use deep reinforcement learning to train a single global control policy that is applicable for all assets considered. The new framework is an extension of a recently introduced control policy methodology for individual assets. Embedding layers are incorporated into the representation to handle the different numbers of decision variables that arise for the different assets. Because the global control policy learns a unified representation of useful features from multiple assets, it is less expensive to construct than asset-by-asset training (we observe about 3x speedup in our examples). The production optimization problem includes a relative-change constraint on the well settings, which renders the results suitable for practical use. We apply the multi-asset CLRM framework to 2D and 3D water-flooding examples. In both cases, four assets with different well counts, well configurations, and geostatistical descriptions are considered. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the global control policy provides objective function values, for both the 2D and 3D cases, that are nearly identical to those from control policies trained individually for each asset. This promising finding suggests that multi-asset CLRM may indeed represent a viable practical strategy.

**Abstract:** The popularity of online fashion shopping continues to grow. The ability to offer an effective recommendation to customers is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we focus on Fashion Outfits Challenge, part of SIGIR 2022 Workshop on eCommerce. The challenge is centered around Fill in the Blank (FITB) task that implies predicting the missing outfit, given an incomplete outfit and a list of candidates. In this paper, we focus on applying siamese networks on the task. More specifically, we explore how combining information from multiple modalities (textual and visual modality) impacts the performance of the model on the task. We evaluate our model on the test split provided by the challenge organizers and the test split with gold assignments that we created during the development phase. We discover that using both visual, and visual and textual data demonstrates promising results on the task. We conclude by suggesting directions for further improvement of our method.

**Abstract:** Image translation based on a generative adversarial network (GAN-IT) is a promising method for precise localization of abnormal regions in chest X-ray images (AL-CXR). However, heterogeneous unpaired datasets undermine existing methods to extract key features and distinguish normal from abnormal cases, resulting in inaccurate and unstable AL-CXR. To address this problem, we propose an improved two-stage GAN-IT involving registration and data augmentation. For the first stage, we introduce an invertible deep-learning-based registration technique that virtually and reasonably converts unpaired data into paired data for learning registration maps. This novel approach achieves high registration performance. For the second stage, we apply data augmentation to diversify anomaly locations by swapping the left and right lung regions on the uniform registered frames, further improving the performance by alleviating imbalance in data distribution showing left and right lung lesions. Our method is intended for application to existing GAN-IT models, allowing existing architecture to benefit from key features for translation. By showing that the AL-CXR performance is uniformly improved when applying the proposed method, we believe that GAN-IT for AL-CXR can be deployed in clinical environments, even if learning data are scarce.

**Abstract:** Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks-based recommender systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers can inject carefully crafted fake user profiles (i.e., a set of items that fake users have interacted with) into a target recommender system to achieve malicious purposes, such as promote or demote a set of target items. Due to the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to perform adversarial attacks under the black-box setting, where the architecture/parameters and training data of target systems cannot be easily accessed by attackers. However, generating high-quality fake user profiles under black-box setting is rather challenging with limited resources to target systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a novel strategy by leveraging items' attribute information (i.e., items' knowledge graph), which can be publicly accessible and provide rich auxiliary knowledge to enhance the generation of fake user profiles. More specifically, we propose a knowledge graph-enhanced black-box attacking framework (KGAttack) to effectively learn attacking policies through deep reinforcement learning techniques, in which knowledge graph is seamlessly integrated into hierarchical policy networks to generate fake user profiles for performing adversarial black-box attacks. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.

**Abstract:** In this paper we present a new dynamical systems algorithm for clustering in hyperspectral images. The main idea of the algorithm is that data points are pushed\' in the direction of increasing density and groups of pixels that end up in the same dense regions belong to the same class. This is essentially a numerical solution of the differential equation defined by the gradient of the density of data points on the data manifold. The number of classes is automated and the resulting clustering can be extremely accurate. In addition to providing a accurate clustering, this algorithm presents a new tool for understanding hyperspectral data in high dimensions. We evaluate the algorithm on the Urban (Available at www.tec.ary.mil/Hypercube/) scene comparing performance against the k-means algorithm using pre-identified classes of materials as ground truth.

**Abstract:** Differentiable renderers provide a direct mathematical link between an object's 3D representation and images of that object. In this work, we develop an approximate differentiable renderer for a compact, interpretable representation, which we call Fuzzy Metaballs. Our approximate renderer focuses on rendering shapes via depth maps and silhouettes. It sacrifices fidelity for utility, producing fast runtimes and high-quality gradient information that can be used to solve vision tasks. Compared to mesh-based differentiable renderers, our method has forward passes that are 5x faster and backwards passes that are 30x faster. The depth maps and silhouette images generated by our method are smooth and defined everywhere. In our evaluation of differentiable renderers for pose estimation, we show that our method is the only one comparable to classic techniques. In shape from silhouette, our method performs well using only gradient descent and a per-pixel loss, without any surrogate losses or regularization. These reconstructions work well even on natural video sequences with segmentation artifacts. Project page: https://leonidk.github.io/fuzzy-metaballs

**Abstract:** When learning disconnected distributions, Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are known to face model misspecification. Indeed, a continuous mapping from a unimodal latent distribution to a disconnected one is impossible, so GANs necessarily generate samples outside of the support of the target distribution. This raises a fundamental question: what is the latent space partition that minimizes the measure of these areas? Building on a recent result of geometric measure theory, we prove that an optimal GANs must structure its latent space as a 'simplicial cluster' - a Voronoi partition where cells are convex cones - when the dimension of the latent space is larger than the number of modes. In this configuration, each Voronoi cell maps to a distinct mode of the data. We derive both an upper and a lower bound on the optimal precision of GANs learning disconnected manifolds. Interestingly, these two bounds have the same order of decrease: $\sqrt{\log m}$, $m$ being the number of modes. Finally, we perform several experiments to exhibit the geometry of the latent space and experimentally show that GANs have a geometry with similar properties to the theoretical one.

**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are becoming a crucial component of modern software systems, but they are prone to fail under conditions that are different from the ones observed during training (out-of-distribution inputs) or on inputs that are truly ambiguous, i.e., inputs that admit multiple classes with nonzero probability in their ground truth labels. Recent work proposed DNN supervisors to detect high-uncertainty inputs before their possible misclassification leads to any harm. To test and compare the capabilities of DNN supervisors, researchers proposed test generation techniques, to focus the testing effort on high-uncertainty inputs that should be recognized as anomalous by supervisors. However, existing test generators can only produce out-of-distribution inputs. No existing model- and supervisor-independent technique supports the generation of truly ambiguous test inputs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel way to generate ambiguous inputs to test DNN supervisors and used it to empirically compare several existing supervisor techniques. In particular, we propose AmbiGuess to generate ambiguous samples for image classification problems. AmbiGuess is based on gradient-guided sampling in the latent space of a regularized adversarial autoencoder. Moreover, we conducted what is - to the best of our knowledge - the most extensive comparative study of DNN supervisors, considering their capabilities to detect 4 distinct types of high-uncertainty inputs, including truly ambiguous ones.

**Abstract:** MOTIVATION: Detection of prostate cancer during transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy is challenging. The highly heterogeneous appearance of cancer, presence of ultrasound artefacts, and noise all contribute to these difficulties. Recent advancements in high-frequency ultrasound imaging - micro-ultrasound - have drastically increased the capability of tissue imaging at high resolution. Our aim is to investigate the development of a robust deep learning model specifically for micro-ultrasound-guided prostate cancer biopsy. For the model to be clinically adopted, a key challenge is to design a solution that can confidently identify the cancer, while learning from coarse histopathology measurements of biopsy samples that introduce weak labels. METHODS: We use a dataset of micro-ultrasound images acquired from 194 patients, who underwent prostate biopsy. We train a deep model using a co-teaching paradigm to handle noise in labels, together with an evidential deep learning method for uncertainty estimation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the clinically relevant metric of accuracy vs. confidence. RESULTS: Our model achieves a well-calibrated estimation of predictive uncertainty with area under the curve of 88$\%$. The use of co-teaching and evidential deep learning in combination yields significantly better uncertainty estimation than either alone. We also provide a detailed comparison against state-of-the-art in uncertainty estimation.

**Abstract:** In recent years, number of edge computing devices and artificial intelligence applications on them have advanced excessively. In edge computing, decision making processes and computations are moved from servers to edge devices. Hence, cheap and low power devices are required. FPGAs are very low power, inclined to do parallel operations and deeply suitable devices for running Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which are the fundamental unit of an artificial intelligence application. Face detection on surveillance systems is the most expected application on the security market. In this work, TinyYolov3 architecture is redesigned and deployed for face detection. It is a CNN based object detection method and developed for embedded systems. PYNQ-Z2 is selected as a target board which has low-end Xilinx Zynq 7020 System-on-Chip (SoC) on it. Redesigned TinyYolov3 model is defined in numerous bit width precisions with Brevitas library which brings fundamental CNN layers and activations in integer quantized form. Then, the model is trained in a quantized structure with WiderFace dataset. In order to decrease latency and power consumption, onchip memory of the FPGA is configured as a storage of whole network parameters and the last activation function is modified as rescaled HardTanh instead of Sigmoid. Also, high degree of parallelism is applied to logical resources of the FPGA. The model is converted to an HLS based application with using FINN framework and FINN-HLS library which includes the layer definitions in C++. Later, the model is synthesized and deployed. CPU of the SoC is employed with multithreading mechanism and responsible for preprocessing, postprocessing and TCP/IP streaming operations. Consequently, 2.4 Watt total board power consumption, 18 Frames-Per-Second (FPS) throughput and 0.757 mAP accuracy rate on Easy category of the WiderFace are achieved with 4 bits precision model.

**Abstract:** Optimizing noisy functions online, when evaluating the objective requires experiments on a deployed system, is a crucial task arising in manufacturing, robotics and many others. Often, constraints on safe inputs are unknown ahead of time, and we only obtain noisy information, indicating how close we are to violating the constraints. Yet, safety must be guaranteed at all times, not only for the final output of the algorithm.
  We introduce a general approach for seeking a stationary point in high dimensional non-linear stochastic optimization problems in which maintaining safety during learning is crucial. Our approach called LB-SGD is based on applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a carefully chosen adaptive step size to a logarithmic barrier approximation of the original problem. We provide a complete convergence analysis of non-convex, convex, and strongly-convex smooth constrained problems, with first-order and zeroth-order feedback. Our approach yields efficient updates and scales better with dimensionality compared to existing approaches.
  We empirically compare the sample complexity and the computational cost of our method with existing safe learning approaches. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on minimizing constraint violation in policy search tasks in safe reinforcement learning (RL).

**Abstract:** Drone detection has become an essential task in object detection as drone costs have decreased and drone technology has improved. It is, however, difficult to detect distant drones when there is weak contrast, long range, and low visibility. In this work, we propose several sequence classification architectures to reduce the detected false-positive ratio of drone tracks. Moreover, we propose a new drone vs. bird sequence classification dataset to train and evaluate the proposed architectures. 3D CNN, LSTM, and Transformer based sequence classification architectures have been trained on the proposed dataset to show the effectiveness of the proposed idea. As experiments show, using sequence information, bird classification and overall F1 scores can be increased by up to 73% and 35%, respectively. Among all sequence classification models, R(2+1)D-based fully convolutional model yields the best transfer learning and fine-tuning results.

**Abstract:** The capacity sharing problem in Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing deals with the distribution of the capacity available in each RAN node among various RAN slices to satisfy their traffic demands and efficiently use the radio resources. While several capacity sharing algorithmic solutions have been proposed in the literature, their practical implementation still remains as a gap. In this paper, the implementation of a Reinforcement Learning-based capacity sharing algorithm over the O-RAN architecture is discussed, providing insights into the operation of the involved interfaces and the containerization of the solution. Moreover, the description of the testbed implemented to validate the solution is included and some performance and validation results are presented.

**Abstract:** Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to remote sensing problems for several years. Among these methods, CNN based models have high accuracy in solving the land classification problem using satellite or aerial images. Although these models have high accuracy, this generally comes with large memory size requirements. On the other hand, it is desirable to have small-sized models for applications, such as the ones implemented on unmanned aerial vehicles, with low memory space. Unfortunately, small-sized CNN models do not provide high accuracy as with their large-sized versions. In this study, we propose a novel method to improve the accuracy of CNN models, especially the ones with small size, by injecting traditional features to them. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied it to the CNN models SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, VGG16, and ResNet50V2 having size 0.5 MB to 528 MB. We used the sample mean, gray level co-occurrence matrix features, Hu moments, local binary patterns, histogram of oriented gradients, and color invariants as traditional features for injection. We tested the proposed method on the EuroSAT dataset to perform land classification. Our experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the land classification accuracy especially when applied to small-sized CNN models.

**Abstract:** Multi-horizon probabilistic time series forecasting has wide applicability to real-world tasks such as demand forecasting. Recent work in neural time-series forecasting mainly focus on the use of Seq2Seq architectures. For example, MQTransformer - an improvement of MQCNN - has shown the state-of-the-art performance in probabilistic demand forecasting. In this paper, we consider incorporating cross-entity information to enhance model performance by adding a cross-entity attention mechanism along with a retrieval mechanism to select which entities to attend over. We demonstrate how our new neural architecture, MQRetNN, leverages the encoded contexts from a pretrained baseline model on the entire population to improve forecasting accuracy. Using MQCNN as the baseline model (due to computational constraints, we do not use MQTransformer), we first show on a small demand forecasting dataset that it is possible to achieve ~3% improvement in test loss by adding a cross-entity attention mechanism where each entity attends to all others in the population. We then evaluate the model with our proposed retrieval methods - as a means of approximating an attention over a large population - on a large-scale demand forecasting application with over 2 million products and observe ~1% performance gain over the MQCNN baseline.

**Abstract:** The key to video inpainting is to use correlation information from as many reference frames as possible. Existing flow-based propagation methods split the video synthesis process into multiple steps: flow completion -> pixel propagation -> synthesis. However, there is a significant drawback that the errors in each step continue to accumulate and amplify in the next step. To this end, we propose an Error Compensation Framework for Flow-guided Video Inpainting (ECFVI), which takes advantage of the flow-based method and offsets its weaknesses. We address the weakness with the newly designed flow completion module and the error compensation network that exploits the error guidance map. Our approach greatly improves the temporal consistency and the visual quality of the completed videos. Experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed method with the speed up of x6, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we present a new benchmark dataset for evaluation by supplementing the weaknesses of existing test datasets.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces an Online Localisation and Colored Mesh Reconstruction (OLCMR) ROS perception architecture for ground exploration robots aiming to perform robust Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) in challenging unknown environments and provide an associated colored 3D mesh representation in real time. It is intended to be used by a remote human operator to easily visualise the mapped environment during or after the mission or as a development base for further researches in the field of exploration robotics. The architecture is mainly composed of carefully-selected open-source ROS implementations of a LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm alongside a colored surface reconstruction procedure using a point cloud and RGB camera images projected into the 3D space. The overall performances are evaluated on the Newer College handheld LiDAR-Vision reference dataset and on two experimental trajectories gathered on board of representative wheeled robots in respectively urban and countryside outdoor environments.

**Abstract:** Abdominal organ segmentation is a difficult and time-consuming task. To reduce the burden on clinical experts, fully-automated methods are highly desirable. Current approaches are dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) however the computational requirements and the need for large data sets limit their application in practice. By implementing a small and efficient custom 3D CNN, compiling the trained model and optimizing the computational graph: our approach produces high accuracy segmentations (Dice Similarity Coefficient (%): Liver: 97.3$\pm$1.3, Kidneys: 94.8$\pm$3.6, Spleen: 96.4$\pm$3.0, Pancreas: 80.9$\pm$10.1) at a rate of 1.6 seconds per image. Crucially, we are able to perform segmentation inference solely on CPU (no GPU required), thereby facilitating easy and widespread deployment of the model without specialist hardware.

**Abstract:** Neural networks are increasingly relied upon as components of complex safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. There is high demand for tools and methods that embed neural network verification in a larger verification cycle. However, neural network verification is difficult due to a wide range of verification properties of interest, each typically only amenable to verification in specialised solvers. In this paper, we show how Imandra, a functional programming language and a theorem prover originally designed for verification, validation and simulation of financial infrastructure can offer a holistic infrastructure for neural network verification. We develop a novel library CheckINN that formalises neural networks in Imandra, and covers different important facets of neural network verification.

**Abstract:** Spinal cord injuries can often lead to quadriplegia in patients limiting their mobility. Wheelchairs could be a good proposition for patients, but most of them operate either manually or with the help of electric motors operated with a joystick. This, however, requires the use of hands, making it unsuitable for quadriplegic patients. Controlling eye movement, on the other hand, is retained even by people who undergo brain injury. Monitoring the movements in the eye can be a helpful tool in generating control signals for the wheelchair. This paper is an approach to converting obtained signals from the eye into meaningful signals by trying to control a bot that imitates a wheelchair. The overall system is cost-effective and uses simple image processing and pattern recognition to control the bot. An android application is developed, which could be used by the patients' aid for more refined control of the wheelchair in the actual scenario.
