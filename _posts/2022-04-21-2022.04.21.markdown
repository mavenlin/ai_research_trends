**Abstract:** Autonomous fabric manipulation is a longstanding challenge in robotics, but evaluating progress is difficult due to the cost and diversity of robot hardware. Using Reach, a cloud robotics platform that enables low-latency remote execution of control policies on physical robots, we present the first systematic benchmarking of fabric manipulation algorithms on physical hardware. We develop 4 novel learning-based algorithms that model expert actions, keypoints, reward functions, and dynamic motions, and we compare these against 4 learning-free and inverse dynamics algorithms on the task of folding a crumpled T-shirt with a single robot arm. The entire lifecycle of data collection, model training, and policy evaluation is performed remotely without physical access to the robot workcell. Results suggest a new algorithm combining imitation learning with analytic methods achieves 84% of human-level performance on the folding task.

**Abstract:** Huge pretrained language models (LMs) have demonstrated surprisingly good zero-shot capabilities on a wide variety of tasks. This gives rise to the appealing vision of a single, versatile model with a wide range of functionalities across disparate applications. However, current leading techniques for leveraging a "frozen" LM -- i.e., leaving its weights untouched -- still often underperform fine-tuning approaches which modify these weights in a task-dependent way. Those, in turn, suffer forgetfulness and compromise versatility, suggesting a tradeoff between performance and versatility. The main message of this paper is that current frozen-model techniques such as prompt tuning are only the tip of the iceberg, and more powerful methods for leveraging frozen LMs can do just as well as fine tuning in challenging domains without sacrificing the underlying model's versatility. To demonstrate this, we introduce three novel methods for leveraging frozen models: input-dependent prompt tuning, frozen readers, and recursive LMs, each of which vastly improves on current frozen-model approaches. Indeed, some of our methods even outperform fine-tuning approaches in domains currently dominated by the latter. The computational cost of each method is higher than that of existing frozen model methods, but still negligible relative to a single pass through a huge frozen LM. Each of these methods constitutes a meaningful contribution in its own right, but by presenting these contributions together we aim to convince the reader of a broader message that goes beyond the details of any given method: that frozen models have untapped potential and that fine-tuning is often unnecessary.

**Abstract:** Generalization bounds are a critical tool to assess the training data requirements of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are assumed to be drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a distribution different from the training distribution. In this work, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary using a QNN and for a broad class of training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training data. We numerically illustrate this by showing that the evolution of a Heisenberg spin chain can be learned using only product training states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics using near term quantum computers and quantum experiments, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits.

**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved leading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative sampling process costs hindered their applications to speech synthesis. This paper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality speech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable convolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term time dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also adopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation quality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer, FastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any intermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech samples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time on a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech synthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff generalized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and FastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis.

**Abstract:** Cross-modal encoders for vision-language (VL) tasks are often pretrained with carefully curated vision-language datasets. While these datasets reach an order of 10 million samples, the labor cost is prohibitive to scale further. Conversely, unimodal encoders are pretrained with simpler annotations that are less cost-prohibitive, achieving scales of hundreds of millions to billions. As a result, unimodal encoders have achieved state-of-art (SOTA) on many downstream tasks. However, challenges remain when applying to VL tasks. The pretraining data is not optimal for cross-modal architectures and requires heavy computational resources. In addition, unimodal architectures lack cross-modal interactions that have demonstrated significant benefits for VL tasks. Therefore, how to best leverage pretrained unimodal encoders for VL tasks is still an area of active research. In this work, we propose a method to leverage unimodal vision and text encoders for VL tasks that augment existing VL approaches while conserving computational complexity. Specifically, we propose Multimodal Adaptive Distillation (MAD), which adaptively distills useful knowledge from pretrained encoders to cross-modal VL encoders. Second, to better capture nuanced impacts on VL task performance, we introduce an evaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual Entailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of data constraints and conditions of domain shift. Experiments demonstrate that MAD leads to consistent gains in the low-shot, domain-shifted, and fully-supervised conditions on VCR, SNLI-VE, and VQA, achieving SOTA performance on VCR compared to other single models pretrained with image-text data. Finally, MAD outperforms concurrent works utilizing pretrained vision encoder from CLIP. Code will be made available.

**Abstract:** The Machine Assisted Generation, Comparison, and Calibration (MAGCC) framework provides machine assistance and automation of recurrent crucial steps and processes in the development, implementation, testing, and use of scientific simulation models. MAGCC bridges systems for knowledge extraction via natural language processing or extracted from existing mathematical models and provides a comprehensive workflow encompassing the composition of scientific models and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted code generation. MAGCC accomplishes this through: 1) the development of a comprehensively expressive formal knowledge representation knowledgebase, the Structured Scientific Knowledge Representation (SSKR) that encompasses all the types of information needed to make any simulation model, 2) the use of an artificially intelligent logic reasoning system, the Computational Modeling Assistant (CMA), that takes information from the SSKR and generates, in a traceable fashion, model specifications across a range of simulation modeling methods, and 3) the use of the CMA to generate executable code for a simulation model from those model specifications. The MAGCC framework can be customized any scientific domain, and future work will integrate newly developed code-generating AI systems.

**Abstract:** Knowledge-based visual question answering (QA) aims to answer a question which requires visually-grounded external knowledge beyond image content itself. Answering complex questions that require multi-hop reasoning under weak supervision is considered as a challenging problem since i) no supervision is given to the reasoning process and ii) high-order semantics of multi-hop knowledge facts need to be captured. In this paper, we introduce a concept of hypergraph to encode high-level semantics of a question and a knowledge base, and to learn high-order associations between them. The proposed model, Hypergraph Transformer, constructs a question hypergraph and a query-aware knowledge hypergraph, and infers an answer by encoding inter-associations between two hypergraphs and intra-associations in both hypergraph itself. Extensive experiments on two knowledge-based visual QA and two knowledge-based textual QA demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for multi-hop reasoning problem.

**Abstract:** Ensuring fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) is important to counteract bias and discrimination in far-reaching applications. Recent work has started to investigate how humans judge fairness and how to support machine learning (ML) experts in making their AI models fairer. Drawing inspiration from an Explainable AI (XAI) approach called \emph{explanatory debugging} used in interactive machine learning, our work explores designing interpretable and interactive human-in-the-loop interfaces that allow ordinary end-users without any technical or domain background to identify potential fairness issues and possibly fix them in the context of loan decisions. Through workshops with end-users, we co-designed and implemented a prototype system that allowed end-users to see why predictions were made, and then to change weights on features to "debug" fairness issues. We evaluated the use of this prototype system through an online study. To investigate the implications of diverse human values about fairness around the globe, we also explored how cultural dimensions might play a role in using this prototype. Our results contribute to the design of interfaces to allow end-users to be involved in judging and addressing AI fairness through a human-in-the-loop approach.

**Abstract:** Cookie banners, the pop ups that appear to collect your consent for data collection, are a tempting ground for dark patterns. Dark patterns are design elements that are used to influence the user's choice towards an option that is not in their interest. The use of dark patterns renders consent elicitation meaningless and voids the attempts to improve a fair collection and use of data. Can machine learning be used to automatically detect the presence of dark patterns in cookie banners? In this work, a dataset of cookie banners of 300 news websites was used to train a prediction model that does exactly that. The machine learning pipeline we used includes feature engineering, parameter search, training a Gradient Boosted Tree classifier and evaluation. The accuracy of the trained model is promising, but allows a lot of room for improvement. We provide an in-depth analysis of the interdisciplinary challenges that automated dark pattern detection poses to artificial intelligence. The dataset and all the code created using machine learning is available at the url to repository removed for review.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation via voice conversion (VC) has been successfully applied to low-resource expressive text-to-speech (TTS) when only neutral data for the target speaker are available. Although the quality of VC is crucial for this approach, it is challenging to learn a stable VC model because the amount of data is limited in low-resource scenarios, and highly expressive speech has large acoustic variety. To address this issue, we propose a novel data augmentation method that combines pitch-shifting and VC techniques. Because pitch-shift data augmentation enables the coverage of a variety of pitch dynamics, it greatly stabilizes training for both VC and TTS models, even when only 1,000 utterances of the target speaker's neutral data are available. Subjective test results showed that a FastSpeech 2-based emotional TTS system with the proposed method improved naturalness and emotional similarity compared with conventional methods.

**Abstract:** Infographics are an aesthetic visual representation of information following specific design principles of human perception. Designing infographics can be a tedious process for non-experts and time-consuming, even for professional designers. With the help of designers, we propose a semi-automated infographic framework for general structured and flow-based infographic design generation. For novice designers, our framework automatically creates and ranks infographic designs for a user-provided text with no requirement for design input. However, expert designers can still provide custom design inputs to customize the infographics. We will also contribute an individual visual group (VG) designs dataset (in SVG), along with a 1k complete infographic image dataset with segmented VGs in this work. Evaluation results confirm that by using our framework, designers from all expertise levels can generate generic infographic designs faster than existing methods while maintaining the same quality as hand-designed infographics templates.

**Abstract:** In this paper is described the ANFIS Unit Neural Network, a deep neural network where each neuron is an independent ANFIS. Two use cases of this network are shown to test the capability of the network. (i) Classification of five imagined words. (ii) Incremental learning in the task of detecting Imagined Word Segments vs. Idle State Segments. In both cases, the proposed network outperforms the conventional methods. Additionally, is described a process of classification where instead of taking the whole instance as one example, each instance is decomposed into a set of smaller instances, and the classification is done by a majority vote over all the predictions of the set. The codes to build the AU-NN used in this paper, are available on the github repository https://github.com/tonahdztoro/AU_NN.

**Abstract:** Sequential modelling of high-dimensional data is an important problem that appears in many domains including model-based reinforcement learning and dynamics identification for control. Latent variable models applied to sequential data (i.e., latent dynamics models) have been shown to be a particularly effective probabilistic approach to solve this problem, especially when dealing with images. However, in many application areas (e.g., robotics), information from multiple sensing modalities is available -- existing latent dynamics methods have not yet been extended to effectively make use of such multimodal sequential data. Multimodal sensor streams can be correlated in a useful manner and often contain complementary information across modalities. In this work, we present a self-supervised generative modelling framework to jointly learn a probabilistic latent state representation of multimodal data and the respective dynamics. Using synthetic and real-world datasets from a multimodal robotic planar pushing task, we demonstrate that our approach leads to significant improvements in prediction and representation quality. Furthermore, we compare to the common learning baseline of concatenating each modality in the latent space and show that our principled probabilistic formulation performs better. Finally, despite being fully self-supervised, we demonstrate that our method is nearly as effective as an existing supervised approach that relies on ground truth labels.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) systems power the world we live in. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to solve tasks in an ever-expanding landscape of scenarios, but our eagerness to apply these powerful models leads us to focus on their performance and deprioritises our ability to understand them. Current research in the field of explainable AI tries to bridge this gap by developing various perturbation or gradient-based explanation techniques. For images, these techniques fail to fully capture and convey the semantic information needed to elucidate why the model makes the predictions it does. In this work, we develop a new form of explanation that is radically different in nature from current explanation methods, such as Grad-CAM. Perception visualization provides a visual representation of what the DNN perceives in the input image by depicting what visual patterns the latent representation corresponds to. Visualizations are obtained through a reconstruction model that inverts the encoded features, such that the parameters and predictions of the original models are not modified. Results of our user study demonstrate that humans can better understand and predict the system's decisions when perception visualizations are available, thus easing the debugging and deployment of deep models as trusted systems.

<p>

**Abstract:** Objective: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to provide direct brain control of devices such as prostheses and computer cursors, which have demonstrated great potential for mobility restoration. One major limitation of current BMIs lies in the unstable performance in online control due to the variability of neural signals, which seriously hinders the clinical availability of BMIs. Method: To deal with the neural variability in online BMI control, we propose a dynamic ensemble Bayesian filter (DyEnsemble). DyEnsemble extends Bayesian filters with a dynamic measurement model, which adjusts its parameters in time adaptively with neural changes. This is achieved by learning a pool of candidate functions and dynamically weighting and assembling them according to neural signals. In this way, DyEnsemble copes with variability in signals and improves the robustness of online control. Results: Online BMI experiments with a human participant demonstrate that, compared with the velocity Kalman filter, DyEnsemble significantly improves the control accuracy (increases the success rate by 13.9% and reduces the reach time by 13.5% in the random target pursuit task) and robustness (performs more stably over different experiment days). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the superiority of DyEnsemble in online BMI control. Significance: DyEnsemble frames a novel and flexible framework for robust neural decoding, which is beneficial to different neural decoding applications.

**Abstract:** Genome sequencing projects are rapidly increasing the number of high-dimensional protein sequence datasets. Clustering a high-dimensional protein sequence dataset using traditional machine learning approaches poses many challenges. Many different feature extraction methods exist and are widely used. However, extracting features from millions of protein sequences becomes impractical because they are not scalable with current algorithms. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient feature extraction approach that extracts significant features. We have proposed two scalable feature extraction approaches for extracting features from huge protein sequences using Apache Spark, which are termed 60d-SPF (60-dimensional Scalable Protein Feature) and 6d-SCPSF (6-dimensional Scalable Co-occurrence-based Probability-Specific Feature). The proposed 60d-SPF and 6d-SCPSF approaches capture the statistical properties of amino acids to create a fixed-length numeric feature vector that represents each protein sequence in terms of 60-dimensional and 6-dimensional features, respectively. The preprocessed huge protein sequences are used as an input in two clustering algorithms, i.e., Scalable Random Sampling with Iterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (SRSIO-FCM) and Scalable Literal Fuzzy C-Means (SLFCM) for clustering. We have conducted extensive experiments on various soybean protein datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction methods, 60d-SPF, 6d-SCPSF, and existing feature extraction methods on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms. The reported results in terms of the Silhouette index and the Davies-Bouldin index show that the proposed 60d-SPF extraction method on SRSIO-FCM and SLFCM clustering algorithms achieves significantly better results than the proposed 6d-SCPSF and existing feature extraction approaches.

**Abstract:** The Weber-Fechner Law observes that human perception scales as the logarithm of the stimulus. We argue that learning algorithms for human concepts could benefit from the Weber-Fechner Law. Specifically, we impose Weber-Fechner on simple neural networks, with or without convolution, via the logarithmic power series of their sorted output. Our experiments show surprising performance and accuracy on the MNIST data set within a few training iterations and limited computational resources, suggesting that Weber-Fechner can accelerate machine learning of human concepts.

**Abstract:** Unrolled neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and fast inference times for the accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction task. However, these approaches depend on fully-sampled scans as ground truth data which is either costly or not possible to acquire in many clinical medical imaging applications; hence, reducing dependence on data is desirable. In this work, we propose modeling the proximal operators of unrolled neural networks with scale-equivariant convolutional neural networks in order to improve the data-efficiency and robustness to drifts in scale of the images that might stem from the variability of patient anatomies or change in field-of-view across different MRI scanners. Our approach demonstrates strong improvements over the state-of-the-art unrolled neural networks under the same memory constraints both with and without data augmentations on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scaled images without significantly increasing the train or inference time.

**Abstract:** Graph data augmentation plays a vital role in regularizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which leverage information exchange along edges in graphs, in the form of message passing, for learning. Due to their effectiveness, simple edge and node manipulations (e.g., addition and deletion) have been widely used in graph augmentation. In this paper, we identify a limitation in such a common augmentation technique. That is, simple edge and node manipulations can create graphs with an identical structure or indistinguishable structures to message passing GNNs but of conflict labels, leading to the sample collision issue and thus the degradation of model performance. To address this problem, we propose SoftEdge, which assigns random weights to a portion of the edges of a given graph to construct dynamic neighborhoods over the graph. We prove that SoftEdge creates collision-free augmented graphs. We also show that this simple method obtains superior accuracy to popular node and edge manipulation approaches and notable resilience to the accuracy degradation with the GNN depth.

**Abstract:** We present a series of new differentially private (DP) algorithms with dimension-independent margin guarantees. For the family of linear hypotheses, we give a pure DP learning algorithm that benefits from relative deviation margin guarantees, as well as an efficient DP learning algorithm with margin guarantees. We also present a new efficient DP learning algorithm with margin guarantees for kernel-based hypotheses with shift-invariant kernels, such as Gaussian kernels, and point out how our results can be extended to other kernels using oblivious sketching techniques. We further give a pure DP learning algorithm for a family of feed-forward neural networks for which we prove margin guarantees that are independent of the input dimension. Additionally, we describe a general label DP learning algorithm, which benefits from relative deviation margin bounds and is applicable to a broad family of hypothesis sets, including that of neural networks. Finally, we show how our DP learning algorithms can be augmented in a general way to include model selection, to select the best confidence margin parameter.

**Abstract:** Deep learning on point clouds has received increased attention thanks to its wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured end-to-end speedup over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine and SpConv, respectively.

**Abstract:** The task of continual learning requires careful design of algorithms that can tackle catastrophic forgetting. However, the noisy label, which is inevitable in a real-world scenario, seems to exacerbate the situation. While very few studies have addressed the issue of continual learning under noisy labels, long training time and complicated training schemes limit their applications in most cases. In contrast, we propose a simple purification technique to effectively cleanse the online data stream that is both cost-effective and more accurate. After purification, we perform fine-tuning in a semi-supervised fashion that ensures the participation of all available samples. Training in this fashion helps us learn a better representation that results in state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Through extensive experimentation on 3 benchmark datasets, MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, we show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We achieve a 24.8% performance gain for CIFAR10 with 20% noise over previous SOTA methods. Our code is publicly available.

**Abstract:** As the pump-and-dump schemes (P&Ds) proliferate in the cryptocurrency market, it becomes imperative to detect such fraudulent activities in advance, to inform potentially susceptible investors before they become victims. In this paper, we focus on the target coin prediction task, i.e., to predict the pump probability of all coins listed in the target exchange before a pump. We conduct a comprehensive study of the latest P&Ds, investigate 709 events organized in Telegram channels from Jan. 2019 to Jan. 2022, and unearth some abnormal yet interesting patterns of P&Ds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that pumped coins exhibit intra-channel homogeneity and inter-channel heterogeneity, which inspires us to develop a novel sequence-based neural network named SNN. Specifically, SNN encodes each channel's pump history as a sequence representation via a positional attention mechanism, which filters useful information and alleviates the noise introduced when the sequence length is long. We also identify and address the coin-side cold-start problem in a practical setting. Extensive experiments show a lift of 1.6% AUC and 41.0% Hit Ratio@3 brought by our method, making it well-suited for real-world application. As a side contribution, we release the source code of our entire data science pipeline on GitHub, along with the dataset tailored for studying the latest P&Ds.

**Abstract:** We develop an asymptotic theory of adversarial estimators (`A-estimators'). Like maximum-likelihood-type estimators (`M-estimators'), both the estimator and estimand are defined as the critical points of a sample and population average respectively. A-estimators generalize M-estimators, as their objective is maximized by one set of parameters and minimized by another. The continuous-updating Generalized Method of Moments estimator, popular in econometrics and causal inference, is among the earliest members of this class which distinctly falls outside the M-estimation framework. Since the recent success of Generative Adversarial Networks, A-estimators received considerable attention in both machine learning and causal inference contexts, where a flexible adversary can remove the need for researchers to manually specify which features of a problem are important. We present general results characterizing the convergence rates of A-estimators under both point-wise and partial identification, and derive the asymptotic root-n normality for plug-in estimates of smooth functionals of their parameters. All unknown parameters may contain functions which are approximated via sieves. While the results apply generally, we provide easily verifiable, low-level conditions for the case where the sieves correspond to (deep) neural networks. Our theory also yields the asymptotic normality of general functionals of neural network M-estimators (as a special case), overcoming technical issues previously identified by the literature. We examine a variety of A-estimators proposed across econometrics and machine learning and use our theory to derive novel statistical results for each of them. Embedding distinct A-estimators into the same framework, we notice interesting connections among them, providing intuition and formal justification for their recent success in practical applications.

**Abstract:** Previous works on font generation mainly focus on the standard print fonts where character's shape is stable and strokes are clearly separated. There is rare research on brush handwriting font generation, which involves holistic structure changes and complex strokes transfer. To address this issue, we propose a novel GAN-based image translation model by integrating the skeleton information. We first extract the skeleton from training images, then design an image encoder and a skeleton encoder to extract corresponding features. A self-attentive refined attention module is devised to guide the model to learn distinctive features between different domains. A skeleton discriminator is involved to first synthesize the skeleton image from the generated image with a pre-trained generator, then to judge its realness to the target one. We also contribute a large-scale brush handwriting font image dataset with six styles and 15,000 high-resolution images. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of our proposed model.

**Abstract:** Background: Neural networks produce biased classification results due to correlation bias (they learn correlations between their inputs and outputs to classify samples, even when those correlations do not represent cause-and-effect relationships).
  Objective: This study introduces a fully unsupervised method of mitigating correlation bias, demonstrated with sentiment classification on COVID-19 social media data.
  Methods: Correlation bias in sentiment classification often arises in conversations about controversial topics. Therefore, this study uses adversarial learning to contrast clusters based on sentiment classification labels, with clusters produced by unsupervised topic modeling. This discourages the neural network from learning topic-related features that produce biased classification results.
  Results: Compared to a baseline classifier, neural contrastive clustering approximately doubles accuracy on bias-prone sentences for human-labeled COVID-19 social media data, without adversely affecting the classifier's overall F1 score. Despite being a fully unsupervised approach, neural contrastive clustering achieves a larger improvement in accuracy on bias-prone sentences than a supervised masking approach.
  Conclusions: Neural contrastive clustering reduces correlation bias in sentiment text classification. Further research is needed to explore generalizing this technique to other neural network architectures and application domains.

**Abstract:** Deep learning has recently achieved significant progress in trajectory forecasting. However, the scarcity of trajectory data inhibits the data-hungry deep-learning models from learning good representations. While mature representation learning methods exist in computer vision and natural language processing, these pre-training methods require large-scale data. It is hard to replicate these approaches in trajectory forecasting due to the lack of adequate trajectory data (e.g., 34K samples in the nuScenes dataset). To work around the scarcity of trajectory data, we resort to another data modality closely related to trajectories-HD-maps, which is abundantly provided in existing datasets. In this paper, we propose PreTraM, a self-supervised pre-training scheme via connecting trajectories and maps for trajectory forecasting. Specifically, PreTraM consists of two parts: 1) Trajectory-Map Contrastive Learning, where we project trajectories and maps to a shared embedding space with cross-modal contrastive learning, and 2) Map Contrastive Learning, where we enhance map representation with contrastive learning on large quantities of HD-maps. On top of popular baselines such as AgentFormer and Trajectron++, PreTraM boosts their performance by 5.5% and 6.9% relatively in FDE-10 on the challenging nuScenes dataset. We show that PreTraM improves data efficiency and scales well with model size.

**Abstract:** We propose and analyze a kernelized version of Q-learning. Although a kernel space is typically infinite-dimensional, extensive study has shown that generalization is only affected by the effective dimension of the data. We incorporate such ideas into the Q-learning framework and derive regret bounds for arbitrary kernels. In particular, we provide concrete bounds for linear kernels and Gaussian RBF kernels; notably, the latter bound looks almost identical to the former, only that the actual dimension is replaced by a different notion of dimensionality. Finally, we test our algorithm on a suite of classic control tasks; remarkably, under the Gaussian RBF kernel, it achieves reasonably good performance after only 1000 environmental steps, while its neural network counterpart, deep Q-learning, still struggles.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection is important for industrial automation and part quality assurance, and while humans can easily detect anomalies in components given a few examples, designing a generic automated system that can perform at human or above human capabilities remains a challenge. In this work, we present a simple new anomaly detection algorithm called FADS (feature-based anomaly detection system) which leverages pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) to generate a statistical model of nominal inputs by observing the activation of the convolutional filters. During inference the system compares the convolutional filter activation of the new input to the statistical model and flags activations that are outside the expected range of values and therefore likely an anomaly. By using a pretrained network, FADS demonstrates excellent performance similar to or better than other machine learning approaches to anomaly detection while at the same time FADS requires no tuning of the CNN weights. We demonstrate FADS ability by detecting process parameter changes on a custom dataset of additively manufactured lattices. The FADS localization algorithm shows that textural differences that are visible on the surface can be used to detect process parameter changes. In addition, we test FADS on benchmark datasets, such as the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, and report good results.

**Abstract:** Urban traffic flow prediction using data-driven models can play an important role in route planning and preventing congestion on highways. These methods utilize data collected from traffic recording stations at different timestamps to predict the future status of traffic. Hence, data collection, transmission, storage, and extraction techniques can have a significant impact on the performance of the traffic flow model. On the other hand, a comprehensive database can provide the opportunity for using complex, yet reliable predictive models such as deep learning methods. However, most of these methods have difficulties in handling missing values and outliers. This study focuses on hybrid deep neural networks to predict traffic flow in the California Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) with missing values. The proposed networks are based on a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to consider the temporal dependencies in the data recorded in each station and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to take the spatial correlations in the adjacent stations into account. Various architecture configurations with series and parallel connections are considered based on RNNs and CNNs, and several prevalent data imputation techniques are used to examine the robustness of the hybrid networks to missing values. A comprehensive analysis performed on two different datasets from PeMS indicates that the proposed series-parallel hybrid network with the mean imputation technique achieves the lowest error in predicting the traffic flow and is robust to missing values up until 21% missing ratio in both complete and incomplete training data scenarios when applied to an incomplete test data.

**Abstract:** The growing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety- and security-critical areas like autonomous driving raises the need for their systematic testing. Coverage-guided testing (CGT) is an approach that applies mutation or fuzzing according to a predefined coverage metric to find inputs that cause misbehavior. With the introduction of a neuron coverage metric, CGT has also recently been applied to DNNs. In this work, we apply CGT to the task of person detection in crowded scenes. The proposed pipeline uses YOLOv3 for person detection and includes finding DNN bugs via sampling and mutation, and subsequent DNN retraining on the updated training set. To be a bug, we require a mutated image to cause a significant performance drop compared to a clean input. In accordance with the CGT, we also consider an additional requirement of increased coverage in the bug definition. In order to explore several types of robustness, our approach includes natural image transformations, corruptions, and adversarial examples generated with the Daedalus attack. The proposed framework has uncovered several thousand cases of incorrect DNN behavior. The relative change in mAP performance of the retrained models reached on average between 26.21\% and 64.24\% for different robustness types. However, we have found no evidence that the investigated coverage metrics can be advantageously used to improve robustness.

**Abstract:** Estimating the effects of continuous-valued interventions from observational data is critically important in fields such as climate science, healthcare, and economics. Recent work focuses on designing neural-network architectures and regularization functions to allow for scalable estimation of average and individual-level dose response curves from high-dimensional, large-sample data. Such methodologies assume ignorability (all confounding variables are observed) and positivity (all levels of treatment can be observed for every unit described by a given covariate value), which are especially challenged in the continuous treatment regime. Developing scalable sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that allow us to understand the ignorance induced in our estimates when these assumptions are relaxed receives less attention. Here, we develop a continuous treatment-effect marginal sensitivity model (CMSM) and derive bounds that agree with both the observed data and a researcher-defined level of hidden confounding. We introduce a scalable algorithm to derive the bounds and uncertainty-aware deep models to efficiently estimate these bounds for high-dimensional, large-sample observational data. We validate our methods using both synthetic and real-world experiments. For the latter, we work in concert with climate scientists interested in evaluating the climatological impacts of human emissions on cloud properties using satellite observations from the past 15 years: a finite-data problem known to be complicated by the presence of a multitude of unobserved confounders.

**Abstract:** Industrial control systems (ICSs) are facing increasing cyber-physical attacks that can cause catastrophes in the physical system. Efficient anomaly detection models in the industrial sensor networks are essential for enhancing ICS reliability and security, due to the sensor data is related to the operational state of the ICS. Considering the limited availability of computing resources, this paper proposes a hybrid anomaly detection approach in cloud-edge collaboration industrial sensor networks. The hybrid approach consists of sensor data detection models deployed at the edges and a sensor data analysis model deployed in the cloud. The sensor data detection model based on Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms can detect the anomalous sensor data in real-time and upload them to the cloud for further analysis, filtering the normal sensor data and reducing traffic load. The sensor data analysis model based on Graph convolutional network, Residual algorithm and Long short-term memory network (GCRL) can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features and then identify the attack precisely. The proposed hybrid anomaly detection approach is evaluated using a benchmark dataset and baseline anomaly detection models. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve an overall 11.19% increase in Recall and an impressive 14.29% improvement in F1-score, compared with the existing models.

**Abstract:** The automated Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) classification technique is essential for assisting clinicians during the diagnosis process. Detecting and classifying ILDs patterns is a challenging problem. This paper introduces an end-to-end deep convolution neural network (CNN) for classifying ILDs patterns. The proposed model comprises four convolutional layers with different kernel sizes and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, followed by batch normalization and max-pooling with a size equal to the final feature map size well as four dense layers. We used the ADAM optimizer to minimize categorical cross-entropy. A dataset consisting of 21328 image patches of 128 CT scans with five classes is taken to train and assess the proposed model. A comparison study showed that the presented model outperformed pre-trained CNNs and five-fold cross-validation on the same dataset. For ILDs pattern classification, the proposed approach achieved the accuracy scores of 99.09% and the average F score of 97.9%, outperforming three pre-trained CNNs. These outcomes show that the proposed model is relatively state-of-the-art in precision, recall, f score, and accuracy.

**Abstract:** The training of a next-best-view (NBV) planner for visual place recognition (VPR) is a fundamentally important task in autonomous robot navigation, for which a typical approach is the use of visual experiences that are collected in the target domain as training data. However, the collection of a wide variety of visual experiences in everyday navigation is costly and prohibitive for real-time robotic applications. We address this issue by employing a novel {\it domain-invariant} NBV planner. A standard VPR subsystem based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is assumed to be available, and its domain-invariant state recognition ability is proposed to be transferred to train the domain-invariant NBV planner. Specifically, we divide the visual cues that are available from the CNN model into two types: the output layer cue (OLC) and intermediate layer cue (ILC). The OLC is available at the output layer of the CNN model and aims to estimate the state of the robot (e.g., the robot viewpoint) with respect to the world-centric view coordinate system. The ILC is available within the middle layers of the CNN model as a high-level description of the visual content (e.g., a saliency image) with respect to the ego-centric view. In our framework, the ILC and OLC are mapped to a state vector and subsequently used to train a multiview NBV planner via deep reinforcement learning. Experiments using the public NCLT dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

**Abstract:** Predicting gene functions is a challenge for biologists in the post genomic era. Interactions among genes and their products compose networks that can be used to infer gene functions. Most previous studies adopt a linkage assumption, i.e., they assume that gene interactions indicate functional similarities between connected genes. In this study, we propose to use a gene's context graph, i.e., the gene interaction network associated with the focal gene, to infer its functions. In a kernel-based machine-learning framework, we design a context graph kernel to capture the information in context graphs. Our experimental study on a testbed of p53-related genes demonstrates the advantage of using indirect gene interactions and shows the empirical superiority of the proposed approach over linkage-assumption-based methods, such as the algorithm to minimize inconsistent connected genes and diffusion kernels.

**Abstract:** Most AI systems are black boxes generating reasonable outputs for given inputs. Some domains, however, have explainability and trustworthiness requirements that cannot be directly met by these approaches. Various methods have therefore been developed to interpret black-box models after training. This paper advocates an alternative approach where the models are transparent and explainable to begin with. This approach, EVOTER, evolves rule-sets based on simple logical expressions. The approach is evaluated in several prediction/classification and prescription/policy search domains with and without a surrogate. It is shown to discover meaningful rule sets that perform similarly to black-box models. The rules can provide insight to the domain, and make biases hidden in the data explicit. It may also be possible to edit them directly to remove biases and add constraints. EVOTER thus forms a promising foundation for building trustworthy AI systems for real-world applications in the future.

**Abstract:** Hierarchical forecasting is a key problem in many practical multivariate forecasting applications - the goal is to obtain coherent predictions for a large number of correlated time series that are arranged in a pre-specified tree hierarchy. In this paper, we present a probabilistic top-down approach to hierarchical forecasting that uses a novel attention-based RNN model to learn the distribution of the proportions according to which each parent prediction is split among its children nodes at any point in time. These probabilistic proportions are then coupled with an independent univariate probabilistic forecasting model (such as Prophet or STS) for the root time series. The resulting forecasts are computed in a top-down fashion and are naturally coherent, and also support probabilistic predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to traditional bottom-up hierarchical modeling. Finally, we experiment on three public datasets and demonstrate significantly improved probabilistic forecasts, compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic hierarchical models.

**Abstract:** The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system is the international standard for classifying diseases and procedures during a healthcare encounter and is widely used for healthcare reporting and management purposes. Assigning correct codes for clinical procedures is important for clinical, operational, and financial decision-making in healthcare. Contextual word embedding models have achieved state-of-the-art results in multiple NLP tasks. However, these models have yet to achieve state-of-the-art results in the ICD classification task since one of their main disadvantages is that they can only process documents that contain a small number of tokens which is rarely the case with real patient notes. In this paper, we introduce ICDBigBird a BigBird-based model which can integrate a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), that takes advantage of the relations between ICD codes in order to create 'enriched' representations of their embeddings, with a BigBird contextual model that can process larger documents. Our experiments on a real-world clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our BigBird-based model on the ICD classification task as it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.

**Abstract:** Albeit of crucial interest for both financial practitioners and researchers, market-implied volatility data of European swaptions often exhibit large portions of missing quotes due to illiquidity of the various underlying swaption instruments. In this case, standard stochastic interpolation tools like the common SABR model often cannot be calibrated to observed implied volatility smiles, due to data being only available for the at-the-money quote of the respective underlying swaption. Here, we propose to infer the geometry of the full unknown implied volatility cube by learning stochastic latent representations of implied volatility cubes via variational autoencoders, enabling inference about the missing volatility data conditional on the observed data by an approximate Gibbs sampling approach. Imputed estimates of missing quotes can afterwards be used to fit a standard stochastic volatility model. Since training data for the employed variational autoencoder model is usually sparsely available, we test the robustness of the approach for a model trained on synthetic data on real market quotes and we show that SABR interpolated volatilites calibrated to reconstructed volatility cubes with artificially imputed missing values differ by not much more than two basis points compared to SABR fits calibrated to the complete cube. Moreover, we show how the imputation can be used to successfully set up delta-neutral portfolios for hedging purposes.

**Abstract:** The decomposition of a time series is an essential task that helps to understand its very nature. It facilitates the analysis and forecasting of complex time series expressing various hidden components such as the trend, seasonal components, cyclic components and irregular fluctuations. Therefore, it is crucial in many fields for forecasting and decision processes. In recent years, many methods of time series decomposition have been developed, which extract and reveal different time series properties. Unfortunately, they neglect a very important property, i.e. time series variance. To deal with heteroscedasticity in time series, the method proposed in this work -- a seasonal-trend-dispersion decomposition (STD) -- extracts the trend, seasonal component and component related to the dispersion of the time series. We define STD decomposition in two ways: with and without an irregular component. We show how STD can be used for time series analysis and forecasting.

**Abstract:** The remarkable progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) brought about by deep learning, particularly with the recent advent of large pre-trained neural language models, is brought into scrutiny as several studies began to discuss and report potential biases in NLP applications. Bias in NLP is found to originate from latent historical biases encoded by humans into textual data which gets perpetuated or even amplified by NLP algorithm. We present a survey to comprehend bias in large pre-trained language models, analyze the stages at which they occur in these models, and various ways in which these biases could be quantified and mitigated. Considering wide applicability of textual affective computing based downstream tasks in real-world systems such as business, healthcare, education, etc., we give a special emphasis on investigating bias in the context of affect (emotion) i.e., Affective Bias, in large pre-trained language models. We present a summary of various bias evaluation corpora that help to aid future research and discuss challenges in the research on bias in pre-trained language models. We believe that our attempt to draw a comprehensive view of bias in pre-trained language models, and especially the exploration of affective bias will be highly beneficial to researchers interested in this evolving field.

**Abstract:** Machine Teaching (MT) is an interactive process where humans train a machine learning model by playing the role of a teacher. The process of designing an MT system involves decisions that can impact both efficiency of human teachers and performance of machine learners. Previous research has proposed and evaluated specific MT systems but there is limited discussion on a general framework for designing them. We propose a framework for designing MT systems and also detail a system for the text classification problem as a specific instance. Our framework focuses on three components i.e. teaching interface, machine learner, and knowledge base; and their relations describe how each component can benefit the others. Our preliminary experiments show how MT systems can reduce both human teaching time and machine learner error rate.

However, there are no guidelines for designing such automated tools and their required degree of automation compared to human experts. In this systematic review, we followed the PRISMA framework to address four research questions: 1) what types of SSD do AI-based automated speech therapy tools address, 2) what is the level of autonomy achieved by such tools, 3) what are the different modes of intervention, and 4) how effective are such tools in comparison with human experts. An extensive search was conducted on digital libraries to find research papers relevant to our study from 2007 to 2022. The results show that AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD are increasingly gaining attention among researchers. Articulation disorders were the most frequently addressed SSD based on the reviewed papers. Further, our analysis shows that most researchers proposed fully automated tools without considering the role of other stakeholders. Our review indicates that mobile-based and gamified applications were the most frequent mode of intervention. The results further show that only a few studies compared the effectiveness of such tools compared to expert Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP). Our paper presents the state-of-the-art in the field, contributes significant insights based on the research questions, and provides suggestions for future research directions.

**Abstract:** Effectively utilizing the vast amounts of ego-centric navigation data that is freely available on the internet can advance generalized intelligent systems, i.e., to robustly scale across perspectives, platforms, environmental conditions, scenarios, and geographical locations. However, it is difficult to directly leverage such large amounts of unlabeled and highly diverse data for complex 3D reasoning and planning tasks. Consequently, researchers have primarily focused on its use for various auxiliary pixel- and image-level computer vision tasks that do not consider an ultimate navigational objective. In this work, we introduce SelfD, a framework for learning scalable driving by utilizing large amounts of online monocular images. Our key idea is to leverage iterative semi-supervised training when learning imitative agents from unlabeled data. To handle unconstrained viewpoints, scenes, and camera parameters, we train an image-based model that directly learns to plan in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. Next, we use unlabeled data to augment the decision-making knowledge and robustness of an initially trained model via self-training. In particular, we propose a pseudo-labeling step which enables making full use of highly diverse demonstration data through "hypothetical" planning-based data augmentation. We employ a large dataset of publicly available YouTube videos to train SelfD and comprehensively analyze its generalization benefits across challenging navigation scenarios. Without requiring any additional data collection or annotation efforts, SelfD demonstrates consistent improvements (by up to 24%) in driving performance evaluation on nuScenes, Argoverse, Waymo, and CARLA.

**Abstract:** The reconstruction of electrons and photons in CMS depends on topological clustering of the energy deposited by an incident particle in different crystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). These clusters are formed by aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology of an electromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material (beampipe, tracker and support structures) causes electrons and photons to start showering before reaching the calorimeter. This effect, combined with the 3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters around the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in these satellite clusters in order to achieve the best possible energy resolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite clusters have been associated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which does not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup interactions (PU). The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade during LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger average PU levels and the increasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods are being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning architectures like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms. These more sophisticated models improve the energy collection and are more resilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and photon energy resolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2. This work will cover the challenges of training the models as well the opportunity that this new approach offers to unify the ECAL energy measurement with the particle identification steps used in the global CMS photon and electron reconstruction.

**Abstract:** Much attention has been paid to dynamical simulation and quantum machine learning (QML) independently as applications for quantum advantage, while the possibility of using QML to enhance dynamical simulations has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we develop a framework for using QML methods to simulate quantum dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. We use generalization bounds, which bound the error a machine learning model makes on unseen data, to rigorously analyze the training data requirements of an algorithm within this framework. This provides a guarantee that our algorithm is resource-efficient, both in terms of qubit and data requirements. Our numerics exhibit efficient scaling with problem size, and we simulate 20 times longer than Trotterization on IBMQ-Bogota.

**Abstract:** Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) and plaque rupture have been recognized as the most frequent risk factor for thrombosis and acute coronary syndrome. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) can identify TCFA and assess cap thickness, which provides an opportunity to assess plaque vulnerability. We developed an automated method that can detect lipidous plaque and assess fibrous cap thickness in IVOCT images. This study analyzed a total of 4,360 IVOCT image frames of 77 lesions among 41 patients. To improve segmentation performance, preprocessing included lumen segmentation, pixel-shifting, and noise filtering on the raw polar (r, theta) IVOCT images. We used the DeepLab-v3 plus deep learning model to classify lipidous plaque pixels. After lipid detection, we automatically detected the outer border of the fibrous cap using a special dynamic programming algorithm and assessed the cap thickness. Our method provided excellent discriminability of lipid plaque with a sensitivity of 85.8% and A-line Dice coefficient of 0.837. By comparing lipid angle measurements between two analysts following editing of our automated software, we found good agreement by Bland-Altman analysis (difference 6.7+/-17 degree; mean 196 degree). Our method accurately detected the fibrous cap from the detected lipid plaque. Automated analysis required a significant modification for only 5.5% frames. Furthermore, our method showed a good agreement of fibrous cap thickness between two analysts with Bland-Altman analysis (4.2+/-14.6 micron; mean 175 micron), indicating little bias between users and good reproducibility of the measurement. We developed a fully automated method for fibrous cap quantification in IVOCT images, resulting in good agreement with determinations by analysts. The method has great potential to enable highly automated, repeatable, and comprehensive evaluations of TCFAs.

**Abstract:** Video decomposition is very important to extract moving foreground objects from complex backgrounds in computer vision, machine learning, and medical imaging, e.g., extracting moving contrast-filled vessels from the complex and noisy backgrounds of X-ray coronary angiography (XCA). However, the challenges caused by dynamic backgrounds, overlapping heterogeneous environments and complex noises still exist in video decomposition. To solve these problems, this study is the first to introduce a flexible visual working memory model in video decomposition tasks to provide interpretable and high-performance hierarchical deep architecture, integrating the transformative representations between sensory and control layers from the perspective of visual and cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, robust PCA unrolling networks acting as a structure-regularized sensor layer decompose XCA into sparse/low-rank structured representations to separate moving contrast-filled vessels from noisy and complex backgrounds. Then, patch recurrent convolutional LSTM networks with a backprojection module embody unstructured random representations of the control layer in working memory, recurrently projecting spatiotemporally decomposed nonlocal patches into orthogonal subspaces for heterogeneous vessel retrieval and interference suppression. This video decomposition deep architecture effectively restores the heterogeneous profiles of intensity and the geometries of moving objects against the complex background interferences. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate moving contrast-filled vessel extraction with excellent flexibility and computational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Purpose of review: This paper reviews opportunities and challenges for decentralised control, change-detection, and learning in the context of resilient robot teams.
  Recent findings: Exogenous fault detection methods can provide a generic detection or a specific diagnosis with a recovery solution. Robot teams can perform active and distributed sensing for detecting changes in the environment, including identifying and tracking dynamic anomalies, as well as collaboratively mapping dynamic environments. Resilient methods for decentralised control have been developed in learning perception-action-communication loops, multi-agent reinforcement learning, embodied evolution, offline evolution with online adaptation, explicit task allocation, and stigmergy in swarm robotics.
  Summary: Remaining challenges for resilient robot teams are integrating change-detection and trial-and-error learning methods, obtaining reliable performance evaluations under constrained evaluation time, improving the safety of resilient robot teams, theoretical results demonstrating rapid adaptation to given environmental perturbations, and designing realistic and compelling case studies.

**Abstract:** Indexing is an effective way to support efficient query processing in large databases. Recently the concept of learned index has been explored actively to replace or supplement traditional index structures with machine learning models to reduce storage and search costs. However, accurate and efficient similarity query processing in high-dimensional metric spaces remains to be an open challenge. In this paper, a novel indexing approach called LIMS is proposed to use data clustering and pivot-based data transformation techniques to build learned indexes for efficient similarity query processing in metric spaces. The underlying data is partitioned into clusters such that each cluster follows a relatively uniform data distribution. Data redistribution is achieved by utilizing a small number of pivots for each cluster. Similar data are mapped into compact regions and the mapped values are totally ordinal. Machine learning models are developed to approximate the position of each data record on the disk. Efficient algorithms are designed for processing range queries and nearest neighbor queries based on LIMS, and for index maintenance with dynamic updates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of LIMS compared with traditional indexes and state-of-the-art learned indexes.

**Abstract:** In photoacoustic tomography (PAT) with flat sensor, we routinely encounter two types of limited data. The first is due to using a finite sensor and is especially perceptible if the region of interest is large relatively to the sensor or located farther away from the sensor. In this paper, we focus on the second type caused by a varying sensitivity of the sensor to the incoming wavefront direction which can be modelled as binary i.e. by a cone of sensitivity. Such visibility conditions result, in Fourier domain, in a restriction of both the image and the data to a bowtie, akin to the one corresponding to the range of the forward operator. The visible ranges, in image and data domains, are related by the wavefront direction mapping. We adapt the wedge restricted Curvelet decomposition, we previously proposed for the representation of the full PAT data, to separate the visible and invisible wavefronts in the image. We optimally combine fast approximate operators with tailored deep neural network architectures into efficient learned reconstruction methods which perform reconstruction of the visible coefficients and the invisible coefficients are learned from a training set of similar data.

**Abstract:** When suggesting Points of Interest (PoIs) to people with autism spectrum disorders, we must take into account that they have idiosyncratic sensory aversions to noise, brightness and other features that influence the way they perceive places. Therefore, recommender systems must deal with these aspects. However, the retrieval of sensory data about PoIs is a real challenge because most geographical information servers fail to provide this data. Moreover, ad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns do not guarantee to cover large geographical areas and lack sustainability. Thus, we investigate the extraction of sensory data about places from the consumer feedback collected by location-based services, on which people spontaneously post reviews from all over the world. Specifically, we propose a model for the extraction of sensory data from the reviews about PoIs, and its integration in recommender systems to predict item ratings by considering both user preferences and compatibility information. We tested our approach with autistic and neurotypical people by integrating it into diverse recommendation algorithms. For the test, we used a dataset built in a crowdsourcing campaign and another one extracted from TripAdvisor reviews. The results show that the algorithms obtain the highest accuracy and ranking capability when using TripAdvisor data. Moreover, by jointly using these two datasets, the algorithms further improve their performance. These results encourage the use of consumer feedback as a reliable source of information about places in the development of inclusive recommender systems.

**Abstract:** The increasing luminosities of future data taking at Large Hadron Collider and next generation collider experiments require an unprecedented amount of simulated events to be produced. Such large scale productions demand a significant amount of valuable computing resources. This brings a demand to use new approaches to event generation and simulation of detector responses. In this paper, we discuss the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to the simulation of the LHCb experiment events. We emphasize main pitfalls in the application of GANs and study the systematic effects in detail. The presented results are based on the Geant4 simulation of the LHCb Cherenkov detector.

**Abstract:** Scientists frequently prioritize learning from data rather than training the best possible model; however, research in machine learning often prioritizes the latter. The development of marginal feature importance methods, such as marginal contribution feature importance, attempts to break this trend by providing a useful framework for explaining relationships in data in an interpretable fashion. In this work, we generalize the framework of marginal contribution feature importance to improve performance with regards to detecting correlated interactions and reducing runtime. To do so, we consider "information subsets" of the set of features $F$ and show that our importance metric can be computed directly after applying fair representation learning methods from the AI fairness literature. The methods of optimal transport and linear regression are considered and explored experimentally for removing all the information of our feature of interest $f$ from the feature set $F$. Given these implementations, we show on real and simulated data that ultra marginal feature importance performs at least as well as marginal contribution feature importance, with substantially faster computation time and better performance in the presence of correlated interactions and unrelated features.

**Abstract:** The relationships between the listener, physical world and virtual environment (VE) should not only inspire the design of natural multimodal interfaces but should be discovered to make sense of the mediating action of VR technologies. This chapter aims to transform an archipelago of studies related to sonic interactions in virtual environments (SIVE) into a research field equipped with a first theoretical framework with an inclusive vision of the challenges to come: the egocentric perspective of the auditory digital twin. In a VE with immersive audio technologies implemented, the role of VR simulations must be enacted by a participatory exploration of sense-making in a network of human and non-human agents, called actors. The guardian of such locus of agency is the auditory digital twin that fosters intra-actions between humans and technology, dynamically and fluidly redefining all those configurations that are crucial for an immersive and coherent experience. The idea of entanglement theory is here mainly declined in an egocentric-spatial perspective related to emerging knowledge of the listener's perceptual capabilities. This is an actively transformative relation with the digital twin potentials to create movement, transparency, and provocative activities in VEs. The chapter contains an original theoretical perspective complemented by several bibliographical references and links to the other book chapters that have contributed significantly to the proposal presented here.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose SinTra, an auto-regressive sequential generative model that can learn from a single multi-track music segment, to generate coherent, aesthetic, and variable polyphonic music of multi-instruments with an arbitrary length of bar. For this task, to ensure the relevance of generated samples and training music, we present a novel pitch-group representation. SinTra, consisting of a pyramid of Transformer-XL with a multi-scale training strategy, can learn both the musical structure and the relative positional relationship between notes of the single training music segment. Additionally, for maintaining the inter-track correlation, we use the convolution operation to process multi-track music, and when decoding, the tracks are independent to each other to prevent interference. We evaluate SinTra with both subjective study and objective metrics. The comparison results show that our framework can learn information from a single music segment more sufficiently than Music Transformer. Also the comparison between SinTra and its variant, i.e., the single-stage SinTra with the first stage only, shows that the pyramid structure can effectively suppress overly-fragmented notes.

**Abstract:** Adversarial attacks hamper the functionality and accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by meddling with subtle perturbations to their inputs.In this work, we propose a new Mask-based Adversarial Defense scheme (MAD) for DNNs to mitigate the negative effect from adversarial attacks. To be precise, our method promotes the robustness of a DNN by randomly masking a portion of potential adversarial images, and as a result, the %classification result output of the DNN becomes more tolerant to minor input perturbations. Compared with existing adversarial defense techniques, our method does not need any additional denoising structure, nor any change to a DNN's design. We have tested this approach on a collection of DNN models for a variety of data sets, and the experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively improve the defense abilities of the DNNs against all of the tested adversarial attack methods. In certain scenarios, the DNN models trained with MAD have improved classification accuracy by as much as 20% to 90% compared to the original models that are given adversarial inputs.

**Abstract:** Modern computer systems need to execute under strict safety constraints (e.g., a power limit), but doing so often conflicts with their ability to deliver high performance (i.e. minimal latency). Prior work uses machine learning to automatically tune hardware resources such that the system execution meets safety constraints optimally. Such solutions monitor past system executions to learn the system's behavior under different hardware resource allocations before dynamically tuning resources to optimize the application execution. However, system behavior can change significantly between different applications and even different inputs of the same applications. Hence, the models learned using data collected a priori are often suboptimal and violate safety constraints when used with new applications and inputs. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of an execution space, which is the cross product of hardware resources, input features, and applications. To dynamically and safely allocate hardware resources from the execution space, we present SCOPE, a resource manager that leverages a novel safe exploration framework. We evaluate SCOPE's ability to deliver improved latency while minimizing power constraint violations by dynamically configuring hardware while running a variety of Apache Spark applications. Compared to prior approaches that minimize power constraint violations, SCOPE consumes comparable power while improving latency by up to 9.5X. Compared to prior approaches that minimize latency, SCOPE achieves similar latency but reduces power constraint violation rates by up to 45.88X, achieving almost zero safety constraint violations across all applications.

**Abstract:** Goal-oriented semantic communication will be a pillar of next-generation wireless networks. Despite significant recent efforts in this area, most prior works are focused on specific data types (e.g., image or audio), and they ignore the goal and effectiveness aspects of semantic transmissions. In contrast, in this paper, a holistic goal-oriented semantic communication framework is proposed to enable a speaker and a listener to cooperatively execute a set of sequential tasks in a dynamic environment. A common language based on a hierarchical belief set is proposed to enable semantic communications between speaker and listener. The speaker, acting as an observer of the environment, utilizes the beliefs to transmit an initial description of its observation (called event) to the listener. The listener is then able to infer on the transmitted description and complete it by adding related beliefs to the transmitted beliefs of the speaker. As such, the listener reconstructs the observed event based on the completed description, and it then takes appropriate action in the environment based on the reconstructed event. An optimization problem is defined to determine the perfect and abstract description of the events while minimizing the transmission and inference costs with constraints on the task execution time and belief efficiency. Then, a novel bottom-up curriculum learning (CL) framework based on reinforcement learning is proposed to solve the optimization problem and enable the speaker and listener to gradually identify the structure of the belief set and the perfect and abstract description of the events. Simulation results show that the proposed CL method outperforms traditional RL in terms of convergence time, task execution cost and time, reliability, and belief efficiency.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models have become an essential tool in current indoor positioning solutions, given their high capabilities to extract meaningful information from the environment. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most used neural networks (NNs) due to that they are capable of learning complex patterns from the input data. Another model used in indoor positioning solutions is the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which provides an acceptable generalization performance as well as a fast speed of learning. In this paper, we offer a lightweight combination of CNN and ELM, which provides a quick and accurate classification of building and floor, suitable for power and resource-constrained devices. As a result, the proposed model is 58\% faster than the benchmark, with a slight improvement in the classification accuracy (by less than 1\%

**Abstract:** We explore future object prediction -- a challenging problem where all objects visible in a future video frame are to be predicted. We propose to tackle this problem end-to-end by training a detection transformer to directly output future objects. In order to make accurate predictions about the future, it is necessary to capture the dynamics in the scene, both of other objects and of the ego-camera. We extend existing detection transformers in two ways to capture the scene dynamics. First, we experiment with three different mechanisms that enable the model to spatiotemporally process multiple frames. Second, we feed ego-motion information to the model via cross-attention. We show that both of these cues substantially improve future object prediction performance. Our final approach learns to capture the dynamics and make predictions on par with an oracle for 100 ms prediction horizons, and outperform baselines for longer prediction horizons.

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning has gained popularity as an effective self-supervised representation learning technique. Several research directions improve traditional contrastive approaches, e.g., prototypical contrastive methods better capture the semantic similarity among instances and reduce the computational burden by considering cluster prototypes or cluster assignments, while adversarial instance-wise contrastive methods improve robustness against a variety of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work jointly considers robustness, cluster-wise semantic similarity and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose SwARo, an adversarial contrastive framework that incorporates cluster assignment permutations to generate representative adversarial samples. We evaluate SwARo on multiple benchmark datasets and against various white-box and black-box attacks, obtaining consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been conducting a second iteration of the CTS challenge since August 2020. The current iteration of the CTS Challenge is a leaderboard-style speaker recognition evaluation using telephony data extracted from the unexposed portions of the Call My Net 2 (CMN2) and Multi-Language Speech (MLS) corpora collected by the LDC. The CTS Challenge is currently organized in a similar manner to the SRE19 CTS Challenge, offering only an open training condition using two evaluation subsets, namely Progress and Test. Unlike in the SRE19 Challenge, no training or development set was initially released, and NIST has publicly released the leaderboards on both subsets for the CTS Challenge. Which subset (i.e., Progress or Test) a trial belongs to is unknown to challenge participants, and each system submission needs to contain outputs for all of the trials. The CTS Challenge has also served, and will continue to do so, as a prerequisite for entrance to the regular SREs (such as SRE21). Since August 2020, a total of 53 organizations (forming 33 teams) from academia and industry have participated in the CTS Challenge and submitted more than 4400 valid system outputs. This paper presents an overview of the evaluation and several analyses of system performance for some primary conditions in the CTS Challenge. The CTS Challenge results thus far indicate remarkable improvements in performance due to 1) speaker embeddings extracted using large-scale and complex neural network architectures such as ResNets along with angular margin losses for speaker embedding extraction, 2) extensive data augmentation, 3) the use of large amounts of in-house proprietary data from a large number of labeled speakers, 4) long-duration fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** The task of 2D human pose estimation is challenging as the number of keypoints is typically large (~ 17) and this necessitates the use of robust neural network architectures and training pipelines that can capture the relevant features from the input image. These features are then aggregated to make accurate heatmap predictions from which the final keypoints of human body parts can be inferred. Many papers in literature use CNN-based architectures for the backbone, and/or combine it with a transformer, after which the features are aggregated to make the final keypoint predictions [1]. In this paper, we consider the recently proposed Bottleneck Transformers [2], which combine CNN and multi-head self attention (MHSA) layers effectively, and we integrate it with a Transformer encoder and apply it to the task of 2D human pose estimation. We consider different backbone architectures and pre-train them using the DINO self-supervised learning method [3], this pre-training is found to improve the overall prediction accuracy. We call our model BTranspose, and experiments show that on the COCO validation set, our model achieves an AP of 76.4, which is competitive with other methods such as [1] and has fewer network parameters. Furthermore, we also present the dependencies of the final predicted keypoints on both the MHSA block and the Transformer encoder layers, providing clues on the image sub-regions the network attends to at the mid and high levels.

**Abstract:** Melanoma is the most malignant skin tumor and usually cancerates from normal moles, which is difficult to distinguish benign from malignant in the early stage. Therefore, many machine learning methods are trying to make auxiliary prediction. However, these methods attach more attention to the image data of suspected tumor, and focus on improving the accuracy of image classification, but ignore the significance of patient-level contextual information for disease diagnosis in actual clinical diagnosis. To make more use of patient information and improve the accuracy of diagnosis, we propose a new melanoma classification model based on EffNet and Resnet. Our model not only uses images within the same patient but also consider patient-level contextual information for better cancer prediction. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model achieved 0.981 ACC. Furthermore, we note that the overall ROC value of the model is 0.976 which is better than the previous state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** In order to make autonomous driving a reality, artificial neural networks have to work reliably in the open-world. However, the open-world is vast and continuously changing, so it is not technically feasible to collect and annotate training datasets which accurately represent this domain. Therefore, there are always domain gaps between training datasets and the open-world which must be understood. In this work, we investigate the domain gaps between high-resolution and low-resolution LiDAR sensors in object detection networks. Using a unique dataset, which enables us to study sensor resolution domain gaps independent of other effects, we show two distinct domain gaps - an inference domain gap and a training domain gap. The inference domain gap is characterised by a strong dependence on the number of LiDAR points per object, while the training gap shows no such dependence. These fndings show that different approaches are required to close these inference and training domain gaps.

**Abstract:** We present a general framework for training safe agents whose naive incentives are unsafe. As an example, manipulative or deceptive behaviour can improve rewards but should be avoided. Most approaches fail here: agents maximize expected return by any means necessary. We formally describe settings with 'delicate' parts of the state which should not be used as a means to an end. We then train agents to maximize the causal effect of actions on the expected return which is not mediated by the delicate parts of state, using Causal Influence Diagram analysis. The resulting agents have no incentive to control the delicate state. We further show how our framework unifies and generalizes existing proposals.

**Abstract:** In healthcare prediction tasks, it is essential to exploit the correlations between medical features and learn better patient health representations. Existing methods try to estimate feature correlations only from data, or increase the quality of estimation by introducing task-specific medical knowledge. However, such methods either are difficult to estimate the feature correlations due to insufficient training samples, or cannot be generalized to other tasks due to reliance on specific knowledge. There are medical research revealing that not all the medical features are strongly correlated. Thus, to address the issues, we expect to group up strongly correlated features and learn feature correlations in a group-wise manner to reduce the learning complexity without losing generality. In this paper, we propose a general patient health representation learning framework MedFACT. We estimate correlations via measuring similarity between temporal patterns of medical features with kernel methods, and cluster features with strong correlations into groups. The feature group is further formulated as a correlation graph, and we employ graph convolutional networks to conduct group-wise feature interactions for better representation learning. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedFACT. The discovered medical findings are also confirmed by literature, providing valuable medical insights and explanations.

**Abstract:** Outlier detection is an important topic in machine learning and has been used in a wide range of applications. Outliers are objects that are few in number and deviate from the majority of objects. As a result of these two properties, we show that outliers are susceptible to a mechanism called fluctuation. This article proposes a method called fluctuation-based outlier detection (FBOD) that achieves a low linear time complexity and detects outliers purely based on the concept of fluctuation without employing any distance, density or isolation measure. Fundamentally different from all existing methods. FBOD first converts the Euclidean structure datasets into graphs by using random links, then propagates the feature value according to the connection of the graph. Finally, by comparing the difference between the fluctuation of an object and its neighbors, FBOD determines the object with a larger difference as an outlier. The results of experiments comparing FBOD with seven state-of-the-art algorithms on eight real-world tabular datasets and three video datasets show that FBOD outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases and that FBOD has only 5% of the execution time of the fastest algorithm.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised person re-identification is a challenging and promising task in the computer vision. Nowadays unsupervised person re-identification methods have achieved great improvements by training with pseudo labels. However, the appearance and label noise are less explicitly studied in the unsupervised manner. To relieve the effects of appearance noise the global features involved, we also take into account the features from two local views and produce multi-scale features. We explore the knowledge distillation to filter label noise, Specifically, we first train a teacher model from noisy pseudo labels in a iterative way, and then use the teacher model to guide the learning of our student model. In our setting, the student model could converge fast in the supervision of the teacher model thus reduce the interference of noisy labels as the teacher model greatly suffered. After carefully handling the noises in the feature learning, Our multi-scale knowledge distillation are proven to be very effective in the unsupervised re-identification. Extensive experiments on three popular person re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, our approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy 85.7% @mAP or 94.3% @Rank-1 on the challenging Market-1501 benchmark with ResNet-50 under the fully unsupervised setting.

**Abstract:** We propose an analog implementation of the transcendental activation function leveraging two spin-orbit torque magnetoresistive random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) devices and a CMOS inverter. The proposed analog neuron circuit consumes 1.8-27x less power, and occupies 2.5-4931x smaller area, compared to the state-of-the-art analog and digital implementations. Moreover, the developed neuron can be readily integrated with memristive crossbars without requiring any intermediate signal conversion units. The architecture-level analyses show that a fully-analog in-memory computing (IMC) circuit that use our SOT-MRAM neuron along with an SOT-MRAM based crossbar can achieve more than 1.1x, 12x, and 13.3x reduction in power, latency, and energy, respectively, compared to a mixed-signal implementation with analog memristive crossbars and digital neurons. Finally, through cross-layer analyses, we provide a guide on how varying the device-level parameters in our neuron can affect the accuracy of multilayer perceptron (MLP) for MNIST classification.

**Abstract:** The performance of most evolutionary metaheuristic algorithms depends on various operators. The crossover operator is one of them and is mainly classified into two standards; application-dependent crossover operators and application-independent crossover operators. These standards always help to choose the best-fitted point in the evolutionary algorithm process. The high efficiency of crossover operators enables minimizing the error that occurred in engineering application optimization within a short time and cost. There are two crucial objectives behind this paper; at first, it is an overview of crossover standards classification that has been used by researchers for solving engineering operations and problem representation. The second objective of this paper; The significance of novel standard crossover is proposed depending on Lagrangian Dual Function (LDF) to progress the formulation of the Lagrangian Problem Crossover (LPX) as a new systematic standard operator. The results of the proposed crossover standards for 100 generations of parent chromosomes are compared to the BX and SBX standards, which are the communal real-coded crossover standards. The accuracy and performance of the proposed standard have evaluated by three unimodal test functions. Besides, the proposed standard results are statistically demonstrated and proved that it has an excessive ability to generate and enhance the novel optimization algorithm compared to BX and SBX.

**Abstract:** Gene/protein interactions provide critical information for a thorough understanding of cellular processes. Recently, considerable interest and effort has been focused on the construction and analysis of genome-wide gene networks. The large body of biomedical literature is an important source of gene/protein interaction information. Recent advances in text mining tools have made it possible to automatically extract such documented interactions from free-text literature. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for constructing and analyzing large-scale gene functional networks based on the gene/protein interactions extracted from biomedical literature repositories using text mining tools. Our proposed framework consists of analyses of the network topology, network topology-gene function relationship, and temporal network evolution to distill valuable information embedded in the gene functional interactions in literature. We demonstrate the application of the proposed framework using a testbed of P53-related PubMed abstracts, which shows that literature-based P53 networks exhibit small-world and scale-free properties. We also found that high degree genes in the literature-based networks have a high probability of appearing in the manually curated database and genes in the same pathway tend to form local clusters in our literature-based networks. Temporal analysis showed that genes interacting with many other genes tend to be involved in a large number of newly discovered interactions.

**Abstract:** Actor-critic algorithms that make use of distributional policy evaluation have frequently been shown to outperform their non-distributional counterparts on many challenging control tasks. Examples of this behavior include the D4PG and DMPO algorithms as compared to DDPG and MPO, respectively [Barth-Maron et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2020]. However, both agents rely on the C51 critic for value estimation.One major drawback of the C51 approach is its requirement of prior knowledge about the minimum andmaximum values a policy can attain as well as the number of bins used, which fixes the resolution ofthe distributional estimate. While the DeepMind control suite of tasks utilizes standardized rewards and episode lengths, thus enabling the entire suite to be solved with a single setting of these hyperparameters, this is often not the case. This paper revisits a natural alternative that removes this requirement, namelya mixture of Gaussians, and a simple sample-based loss function to train it in an off-policy regime. We empirically evaluate its performance on a broad range of continuous control tasks and demonstrate that it eliminates the need for these distributional hyperparameters and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of challenging tasks (e.g. the humanoid, dog, quadruped, and manipulator domains). Finallywe provide an implementation in the Acme agent repository.

**Abstract:** The 2021 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE21) was the latest cycle of the ongoing evaluation series conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1996. It was the second large-scale multimodal speaker/person recognition evaluation organized by NIST (the first one being SRE19). Similar to SRE19, it featured two core evaluation tracks, namely audio and audio-visual, as well as an optional visual track. In addition to offering fixed and open training conditions, it also introduced new challenges for the community, thanks to a new multimodal (i.e., audio, video, and selfie images) and multilingual (i.e., with multilingual speakers) corpus, termed WeCanTalk, collected outside North America by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). These challenges included: 1) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test segments originating from different domains (i.e., telephony versus video), and 2) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test segments spoken in different languages (i.e., cross-lingual trials). This paper presents an overview of SRE21 including the tasks, performance metric, data, evaluation protocol, results and system performance analyses. A total of 23 organizations (forming 15 teams) from academia and industry participated in SRE21 and submitted 158 valid system outputs. Evaluation results indicate: audio-visual fusion produce substantial gains in performance over audio-only or visual-only systems; top performing speaker and face recognition systems exhibited comparable performance under the matched domain conditions present in this evaluation; and, the use of complex neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet) along with angular losses with margin, data augmentation, as well as long duration fine-tuning contributed to notable performance improvements for the audio-only speaker recognition task.

**Abstract:** Support vector machines (SVMs) are popular learning algorithms to deal with binary classification problems. They traditionally assume equal misclassification costs for each class; however, real-world problems may have an uneven class distribution. This article introduces EBCS-SVM: evolutionary bilevel cost-sensitive SVMs. EBCS-SVM handles imbalanced classification problems by simultaneously learning the support vectors and optimizing the SVM hyperparameters, which comprise the kernel parameter and misclassification costs. The resulting optimization problem is a bilevel problem, where the lower level determines the support vectors and the upper level the hyperparameters. This optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) at the upper level and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) at the lower level. These two methods work in a nested fashion, that is, the optimal support vectors help guide the search of the hyperparameters, and the lower level is initialized based on previous successful solutions. The proposed method is assessed using 70 datasets of imbalanced classification and compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results, supported by a Bayesian test, provided evidence of the effectiveness of EBCS-SVM when working with highly imbalanced datasets.

**Abstract:** The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how healthcare is delivered to patients, how patients interact with healthcare providers, and how healthcare information is disseminated to both healthcare providers and patients. Analytical models that were trained and tested pre-pandemic may no longer be performing up to expectations, providing unreliable and irrelevant learning (ML) models given that ML depends on the basic principle that what happened in the past are likely to repeat in the future. ML faced to two important degradation principles, concept drift, when the underlying properties and characteristics of the variables change and data drift, when the data distributions, probabilities, co-variates, and other variable relationships change, both of which are prime culprits of model failure. Therefore, detecting and diagnosing drift in existing models is something that has become an imperative. And perhaps even more important is a shift in our mindset towards a conscious recognition that drift is inevitable, and model building must incorporate intentional resilience, the ability to offset and recover quickly from failure, and proactive robustness, avoiding failure by developing models that are less vulnerable to drift and disruption.

**Abstract:** Compared with other imaging modalities, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has significant advantages for guiding percutaneous coronary interventions. To aid IVOCT research studies, we developed the Optical Coherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) analysis software. To automate image analysis results, the software includes several important algorithmic steps: pre-processing, deep learning plaque segmentation, machine learning identification of stent struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive visualization and manual editing of segmentations were included in the software. Quantifications include stent deployment characteristics (e.g., stent strut malapposition), strut level analysis, calcium angle, and calcium thickness measurements. Interactive visualizations include (x,y) anatomical, en face, and longitudinal views with optional overlays. Underlying plaque segmentation algorithm yielded excellent pixel-wise results (86.2% sensitivity and 0.781 F1 score). Using OCTOPUS on 34 new pullbacks, we determined that following automated segmentation, only 13% and 23% of frames needed any manual touch up for detailed lumen and calcification labeling, respectively. Only up to 3.8% of plaque pixels were modified, leading to an average editing time of only 7.5 seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to manual analysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity and precision were both greater than 90%, and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or uncovered with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and evaluated the clinical application of a highly automated software package, OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images. The software is currently used as an offline tool for research purposes; however, the software's embedded algorithms may also be useful for real-time treatment planning.

**Abstract:** Counterfactual explanations are increasingly used to address interpretability, recourse, and bias in AI decisions. However, we do not know how well counterfactual explanations help users to understand a systems decisions, since no large scale user studies have compared their efficacy to other sorts of explanations such as causal explanations (which have a longer track record of use in rule based and decision tree models). It is also unknown whether counterfactual explanations are equally effective for categorical as for continuous features, although current methods assume they do. Hence, in a controlled user study with 127 volunteer participants, we tested the effects of counterfactual and causal explanations on the objective accuracy of users predictions of the decisions made by a simple AI system, and participants subjective judgments of satisfaction and trust in the explanations. We discovered a dissociation between objective and subjective measures: counterfactual explanations elicit higher accuracy of predictions than no-explanation control descriptions but no higher accuracy than causal explanations, yet counterfactual explanations elicit greater satisfaction and trust than causal explanations. We also found that users understand explanations referring to categorical features more readily than those referring to continuous features. We discuss the implications of these findings for current and future counterfactual methods in XAI.

**Abstract:** Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user behaviour. Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been proposed to improve recommendation performance. However, most of existing SSL methods use a uniform data augmentation scheme, which loses the sequence correlation of an original sequence. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Learnable Model Augmentation self-supervised learning for sequential Recommendation (LMA4Rec). Specifically, LMA4Rec first takes model augmentation as a supplementary method for data augmentation to generate views. Then, LMA4Rec uses learnable Bernoulli dropout to implement model augmentation learnable operations. Next, self-supervised learning is used between the contrastive views to extract self-supervised signals from an original sequence. Finally, experiments on three public datasets show that the LMA4Rec method effectively improves sequential recommendation performance compared with baseline methods.

**Abstract:** Discrete-time modeling of acoustic, mechanical and electrical systems is a prominent topic in the musical signal processing literature. Such models are mostly derived by discretizing a mathematical model, given in terms of ordinary or partial differential equations, using established techniques. Recent work has applied the techniques of machine-learning to construct such models automatically from data for the case of systems which have lumped states described by scalar values, such as electrical circuits. In this work, we examine how similar techniques are able to construct models of systems which have spatially distributed rather than lumped states. We describe several novel recurrent neural network structures, and show how they can be thought of as an extension of modal techniques. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for three physical systems and show that the proposed network structures can be trained with this data to reproduce the behavior of these systems.

**Abstract:** Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) aims to discriminate similar subcategories, whose main challenge is the large intraclass diversities and subtle inter-class differences. Existing FGVC methods usually select discriminant regions found by a trained model, which is prone to neglect other potential discriminant information. On the other hand, the massive interactions between the sequence of image patches in ViT make the resulting class-token contain lots of redundant information, which may also impacts FGVC performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for FGVC, which can simultaneously make use of partial yet sufficient discriminative information in environmental cues and also compress the redundant information in class-token with respect to the target. Specifically, our model calculates the ratio of high-weight regions in a batch, adaptively adjusts the masking threshold and achieves moderate extraction of background information in the input space. Moreover, we also use the Information Bottleneck~(IB) approach to guide our network to learn a minimum sufficient representations in the feature space. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmark datasets verify that our approach can achieve outperforming performance than other state-of-the-art approaches and baseline models.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning. Despite their rapid development, GNNs also faces some challenges, such as over-fitting, over-smoothing, and non-robustness. Previous works indicate that these problems can be alleviated by random dropping methods, which integrate noises into models by randomly masking parts of the input. However, some open-ended problems of random dropping on GNNs remain to solve. First, it is challenging to find a universal method that are suitable for all cases considering the divergence of different datasets and models. Second, random noises introduced to GNNs cause the incomplete coverage of parameters and unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel random dropping method called DropMessage, which performs dropping operations directly on the message matrix and can be applied to any message-passing GNNs. Furthermore, we elaborate the superiority of DropMessage: it stabilizes the training process by reducing sample variance; it keeps information diversity from the perspective of information theory, which makes it a theoretical upper bound of other methods. Also, we unify existing random dropping methods into our framework and analyze their effects on GNNs. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments that aims for multiple tasks on five public datasets and two industrial datasets with various backbone models. The experimental results show that DropMessage has both advantages of effectiveness and generalization.

**Abstract:** Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful but computationally expensive machine learning models, requiring an estimate of the kernel covariance matrix for every prediction. In large and complex domains, such as graphs, sets, or images, the choice of suitable kernel can also be non-trivial to determine, providing an additional obstacle to the learning task. Over the last decade, these challenges have resulted in significant advances being made in terms of scalability and expressivity, exemplified by, e.g., the use of inducing points and neural network kernel approximations. In this paper, we propose inducing Gaussian process networks (IGN), a simple framework for simultaneously learning the feature space as well as the inducing points. The inducing points, in particular, are learned directly in the feature space, enabling a seamless representation of complex structured domains while also facilitating scalable gradient-based learning methods. We consider both regression and (binary) classification tasks and report on experimental results for real-world data sets showing that IGNs provide significant advances over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate how IGNs can be used to effectively model complex domains using neural network architectures.
