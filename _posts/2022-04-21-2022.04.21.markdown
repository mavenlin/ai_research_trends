**Abstract:** Huge pretrained language models (LMs) have demonstrated surprisingly good zero-shot capabilities on a wide variety of tasks. This gives rise to the appealing vision of a single, versatile model with a wide range of functionalities across disparate applications. However, current leading techniques for leveraging a "frozen" LM -- i.e., leaving its weights untouched -- still often underperform fine-tuning approaches which modify these weights in a task-dependent way. Those, in turn, suffer forgetfulness and compromise versatility, suggesting a tradeoff between performance and versatility. The main message of this paper is that current frozen-model techniques such as prompt tuning are only the tip of the iceberg, and more powerful methods for leveraging frozen LMs can do just as well as fine tuning in challenging domains without sacrificing the underlying model's versatility. To demonstrate this, we introduce three novel methods for leveraging frozen models: input-dependent prompt tuning, frozen readers, and recursive LMs, each of which vastly improves on current frozen-model approaches. Indeed, some of our methods even outperform fine-tuning approaches in domains currently dominated by the latter. The computational cost of each method is higher than that of existing frozen model methods, but still negligible relative to a single pass through a huge frozen LM. Each of these methods constitutes a meaningful contribution in its own right, but by presenting these contributions together we aim to convince the reader of a broader message that goes beyond the details of any given method: that frozen models have untapped potential and that fine-tuning is often unnecessary.

**Abstract:** Generalization bounds are a critical tool to assess the training data requirements of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are assumed to be drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a distribution different from the training distribution. In this work, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary using a QNN and for a broad class of training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training data. We numerically illustrate this by showing that the evolution of a Heisenberg spin chain can be learned using only product training states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics using near term quantum computers and quantum experiments, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits.

**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have recently achieved leading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative sampling process costs hindered their applications to speech synthesis. This paper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality speech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable convolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term time dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also adopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation quality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer, FastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any intermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech samples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time on a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech synthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff generalized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and FastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech synthesis. Audio samples are available at \url{https://FastDiff.github.io/}.

**Abstract:** Autonomous fabric manipulation is a longstanding challenge in robotics, but evaluating progress is difficult due to the cost and diversity of robot hardware. Using Reach, a cloud robotics platform that enables low-latency remote execution of control policies on physical robots, we present the first systematic benchmarking of fabric manipulation algorithms on physical hardware. We develop 4 novel learning-based algorithms that model expert actions, keypoints, reward functions, and dynamic motions, and we compare these against 4 learning-free and inverse dynamics algorithms on the task of folding a crumpled T-shirt with a single robot arm. The entire lifecycle of data collection, model training, and policy evaluation is performed remotely without physical access to the robot workcell. Results suggest a new algorithm combining imitation learning with analytic methods achieves 84% of human-level performance on the folding task.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation via voice conversion (VC) has been successfully applied to low-resource expressive text-to-speech (TTS) when only neutral data for the target speaker are available. Although the quality of VC is crucial for this approach, it is challenging to learn a stable VC model because the amount of data is limited in low-resource scenarios, and highly expressive speech has large acoustic variety. To address this issue, we propose a novel data augmentation method that combines pitch-shifting and VC techniques. Because pitch-shift data augmentation enables the coverage of a variety of pitch dynamics, it greatly stabilizes training for both VC and TTS models, even when only 1,000 utterances of the target speaker's neutral data are available. Subjective test results showed that a FastSpeech 2-based emotional TTS system with the proposed method improved naturalness and emotional similarity compared with conventional methods.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose SinTra, an auto-regressive sequential generative model that can learn from a single multi-track music segment, to generate coherent, aesthetic, and variable polyphonic music of multi-instruments with an arbitrary length of bar. For this task, to ensure the relevance of generated samples and training music, we present a novel pitch-group representation. SinTra, consisting of a pyramid of Transformer-XL with a multi-scale training strategy, can learn both the musical structure and the relative positional relationship between notes of the single training music segment. Additionally, for maintaining the inter-track correlation, we use the convolution operation to process multi-track music, and when decoding, the tracks are independent to each other to prevent interference. We evaluate SinTra with both subjective study and objective metrics. The comparison results show that our framework can learn information from a single music segment more sufficiently than Music Transformer. Also the comparison between SinTra and its variant, i.e., the single-stage SinTra with the first stage only, shows that the pyramid structure can effectively suppress overly-fragmented notes.

**Abstract:** Infographics are an aesthetic visual representation of information following specific design principles of human perception. Designing infographics can be a tedious process for non-experts and time-consuming, even for professional designers. With the help of designers, we propose a semi-automated infographic framework for general structured and flow-based infographic design generation. For novice designers, our framework automatically creates and ranks infographic designs for a user-provided text with no requirement for design input. However, expert designers can still provide custom design inputs to customize the infographics. We will also contribute an individual visual group (VG) designs dataset (in SVG), along with a 1k complete infographic image dataset with segmented VGs in this work. Evaluation results confirm that by using our framework, designers from all expertise levels can generate generic infographic designs faster than existing methods while maintaining the same quality as hand-designed infographics templates.

**Abstract:** Anomaly detection is important for industrial automation and part quality assurance, and while humans can easily detect anomalies in components given a few examples, designing a generic automated system that can perform at human or above human capabilities remains a challenge. In this work, we present a simple new anomaly detection algorithm called FADS (feature-based anomaly detection system) which leverages pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) to generate a statistical model of nominal inputs by observing the activation of the convolutional filters. During inference the system compares the convolutional filter activation of the new input to the statistical model and flags activations that are outside the expected range of values and therefore likely an anomaly. By using a pretrained network, FADS demonstrates excellent performance similar to or better than other machine learning approaches to anomaly detection while at the same time FADS requires no tuning of the CNN weights. We demonstrate FADS ability by detecting process parameter changes on a custom dataset of additively manufactured lattices. The FADS localization algorithm shows that textural differences that are visible on the surface can be used to detect process parameter changes. In addition, we test FADS on benchmark datasets, such as the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, and report good results.

**Abstract:** The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been conducting a second iteration of the CTS challenge since August 2020. The current iteration of the CTS Challenge is a leaderboard-style speaker recognition evaluation using telephony data extracted from the unexposed portions of the Call My Net 2 (CMN2) and Multi-Language Speech (MLS) corpora collected by the LDC. The CTS Challenge is currently organized in a similar manner to the SRE19 CTS Challenge, offering only an open training condition using two evaluation subsets, namely Progress and Test. Unlike in the SRE19 Challenge, no training or development set was initially released, and NIST has publicly released the leaderboards on both subsets for the CTS Challenge. Which subset (i.e., Progress or Test) a trial belongs to is unknown to challenge participants, and each system submission needs to contain outputs for all of the trials. The CTS Challenge has also served, and will continue to do so, as a prerequisite for entrance to the regular SREs (such as SRE21). Since August 2020, a total of 53 organizations (forming 33 teams) from academia and industry have participated in the CTS Challenge and submitted more than 4400 valid system outputs. This paper presents an overview of the evaluation and several analyses of system performance for some primary conditions in the CTS Challenge. The CTS Challenge results thus far indicate remarkable improvements in performance due to 1) speaker embeddings extracted using large-scale and complex neural network architectures such as ResNets along with angular margin losses for speaker embedding extraction, 2) extensive data augmentation, 3) the use of large amounts of in-house proprietary data from a large number of labeled speakers, 4) long-duration fine-tuning.

**Abstract:** When suggesting Points of Interest (PoIs) to people with autism spectrum disorders, we must take into account that they have idiosyncratic sensory aversions to noise, brightness and other features that influence the way they perceive places. Therefore, recommender systems must deal with these aspects. However, the retrieval of sensory data about PoIs is a real challenge because most geographical information servers fail to provide this data. Moreover, ad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns do not guarantee to cover large geographical areas and lack sustainability. Thus, we investigate the extraction of sensory data about places from the consumer feedback collected by location-based services, on which people spontaneously post reviews from all over the world. Specifically, we propose a model for the extraction of sensory data from the reviews about PoIs, and its integration in recommender systems to predict item ratings by considering both user preferences and compatibility information. We tested our approach with autistic and neurotypical people by integrating it into diverse recommendation algorithms. For the test, we used a dataset built in a crowdsourcing campaign and another one extracted from TripAdvisor reviews. The results show that the algorithms obtain the highest accuracy and ranking capability when using TripAdvisor data. Moreover, by jointly using these two datasets, the algorithms further improve their performance. These results encourage the use of consumer feedback as a reliable source of information about places in the development of inclusive recommender systems.

**Abstract:** The increasing luminosities of future data taking at Large Hadron Collider and next generation collider experiments require an unprecedented amount of simulated events to be produced. Such large scale productions demand a significant amount of valuable computing resources. This brings a demand to use new approaches to event generation and simulation of detector responses. In this paper, we discuss the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to the simulation of the LHCb experiment events. We emphasize main pitfalls in the application of GANs and study the systematic effects in detail. The presented results are based on the Geant4 simulation of the LHCb Cherenkov detector.

**Abstract:** Industrial control systems (ICSs) are facing increasing cyber-physical attacks that can cause catastrophes in the physical system. Efficient anomaly detection models in the industrial sensor networks are essential for enhancing ICS reliability and security, due to the sensor data is related to the operational state of the ICS. Considering the limited availability of computing resources, this paper proposes a hybrid anomaly detection approach in cloud-edge collaboration industrial sensor networks. The hybrid approach consists of sensor data detection models deployed at the edges and a sensor data analysis model deployed in the cloud. The sensor data detection model based on Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms can detect the anomalous sensor data in real-time and upload them to the cloud for further analysis, filtering the normal sensor data and reducing traffic load. The sensor data analysis model based on Graph convolutional network, Residual algorithm and Long short-term memory network (GCRL) can effectively extract the spatial and temporal features and then identify the attack precisely. The proposed hybrid anomaly detection approach is evaluated using a benchmark dataset and baseline anomaly detection models. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve an overall 11.19% increase in Recall and an impressive 14.29% improvement in F1-score, compared with the existing models.

**Abstract:** The relationships between the listener, physical world and virtual environment (VE) should not only inspire the design of natural multimodal interfaces but should be discovered to make sense of the mediating action of VR technologies. This chapter aims to transform an archipelago of studies related to sonic interactions in virtual environments (SIVE) into a research field equipped with a first theoretical framework with an inclusive vision of the challenges to come: the egocentric perspective of the auditory digital twin. In a VE with immersive audio technologies implemented, the role of VR simulations must be enacted by a participatory exploration of sense-making in a network of human and non-human agents, called actors. The guardian of such locus of agency is the auditory digital twin that fosters intra-actions between humans and technology, dynamically and fluidly redefining all those configurations that are crucial for an immersive and coherent experience. The idea of entanglement theory is here mainly declined in an egocentric-spatial perspective related to emerging knowledge of the listener's perceptual capabilities. This is an actively transformative relation with the digital twin potentials to create movement, transparency, and provocative activities in VEs. The chapter contains an original theoretical perspective complemented by several bibliographical references and links to the other book chapters that have contributed significantly to the proposal presented here.

**Abstract:** We explore future object prediction -- a challenging problem where all objects visible in a future video frame are to be predicted. We propose to tackle this problem end-to-end by training a detection transformer to directly output future objects. In order to make accurate predictions about the future, it is necessary to capture the dynamics in the scene, both of other objects and of the ego-camera. We extend existing detection transformers in two ways to capture the scene dynamics. First, we experiment with three different mechanisms that enable the model to spatiotemporally process multiple frames. Second, we feed ego-motion information to the model via cross-attention. We show that both of these cues substantially improve future object prediction performance. Our final approach learns to capture the dynamics and make predictions on par with an oracle for 100 ms prediction horizons, and outperform baselines for longer prediction horizons.

**Abstract:** Effectively utilizing the vast amounts of ego-centric navigation data that is freely available on the internet can advance generalized intelligent systems, i.e., to robustly scale across perspectives, platforms, environmental conditions, scenarios, and geographical locations. However, it is difficult to directly leverage such large amounts of unlabeled and highly diverse data for complex 3D reasoning and planning tasks. Consequently, researchers have primarily focused on its use for various auxiliary pixel- and image-level computer vision tasks that do not consider an ultimate navigational objective. In this work, we introduce SelfD, a framework for learning scalable driving by utilizing large amounts of online monocular images. Our key idea is to leverage iterative semi-supervised training when learning imitative agents from unlabeled data. To handle unconstrained viewpoints, scenes, and camera parameters, we train an image-based model that directly learns to plan in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. Next, we use unlabeled data to augment the decision-making knowledge and robustness of an initially trained model via self-training. In particular, we propose a pseudo-labeling step which enables making full use of highly diverse demonstration data through "hypothetical" planning-based data augmentation. We employ a large dataset of publicly available YouTube videos to train SelfD and comprehensively analyze its generalization benefits across challenging navigation scenarios. Without requiring any additional data collection or annotation efforts, SelfD demonstrates consistent improvements (by up to 24%) in driving performance evaluation on nuScenes, Argoverse, Waymo, and CARLA.

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning has gained popularity as an effective self-supervised representation learning technique. Several research directions improve traditional contrastive approaches, e.g., prototypical contrastive methods better capture the semantic similarity among instances and reduce the computational burden by considering cluster prototypes or cluster assignments, while adversarial instance-wise contrastive methods improve robustness against a variety of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work jointly considers robustness, cluster-wise semantic similarity and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose SwARo, an adversarial contrastive framework that incorporates cluster assignment permutations to generate representative adversarial samples. We evaluate SwARo on multiple benchmark datasets and against various white-box and black-box attacks, obtaining consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** Estimating the effects of continuous-valued interventions from observational data is critically important in fields such as climate science, healthcare, and economics. Recent work focuses on designing neural-network architectures and regularization functions to allow for scalable estimation of average and individual-level dose response curves from high-dimensional, large-sample data. Such methodologies assume ignorability (all confounding variables are observed) and positivity (all levels of treatment can be observed for every unit described by a given covariate value), which are especially challenged in the continuous treatment regime. Developing scalable sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that allow us to understand the ignorance induced in our estimates when these assumptions are relaxed receives less attention. Here, we develop a continuous treatment-effect marginal sensitivity model (CMSM) and derive bounds that agree with both the observed data and a researcher-defined level of hidden confounding. We introduce a scalable algorithm to derive the bounds and uncertainty-aware deep models to efficiently estimate these bounds for high-dimensional, large-sample observational data. We validate our methods using both synthetic and real-world experiments. For the latter, we work in concert with climate scientists interested in evaluating the climatological impacts of human emissions on cloud properties using satellite observations from the past 15 years: a finite-data problem known to be complicated by the presence of a multitude of unobserved confounders.

**Abstract:** We present a general framework for training safe agents whose naive incentives are unsafe. As an example, manipulative or deceptive behaviour can improve rewards but should be avoided. Most approaches fail here: agents maximize expected return by any means necessary. We formally describe settings with 'delicate' parts of the state which should not be used as a means to an end. We then train agents to maximize the causal effect of actions on the expected return which is not mediated by the delicate parts of state, using Causal Influence Diagram analysis. The resulting agents have no incentive to control the delicate state. We further show how our framework unifies and generalizes existing proposals.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) systems power the world we live in. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to solve tasks in an ever-expanding landscape of scenarios, but our eagerness to apply these powerful models leads us to focus on their performance and deprioritises our ability to understand them. Current research in the field of explainable AI tries to bridge this gap by developing various perturbation or gradient-based explanation techniques. For images, these techniques fail to fully capture and convey the semantic information needed to elucidate why the model makes the predictions it does. In this work, we develop a new form of explanation that is radically different in nature from current explanation methods, such as Grad-CAM. Perception visualization provides a visual representation of what the DNN perceives in the input image by depicting what visual patterns the latent representation corresponds to. Visualizations are obtained through a reconstruction model that inverts the encoded features, such that the parameters and predictions of the original models are not modified. Results of our user study demonstrate that humans can better understand and predict the system's decisions when perception visualizations are available, thus easing the debugging and deployment of deep models as trusted systems.

**Abstract:** Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful but computationally expensive machine learning models, requiring an estimate of the kernel covariance matrix for every prediction. In large and complex domains, such as graphs, sets, or images, the choice of suitable kernel can also be non-trivial to determine, providing an additional obstacle to the learning task. Over the last decade, these challenges have resulted in significant advances being made in terms of scalability and expressivity, exemplified by, e.g., the use of inducing points and neural network kernel approximations. In this paper, we propose inducing Gaussian process networks (IGN), a simple framework for simultaneously learning the feature space as well as the inducing points. The inducing points, in particular, are learned directly in the feature space, enabling a seamless representation of complex structured domains while also facilitating scalable gradient-based learning methods. We consider both regression and (binary) classification tasks and report on experimental results for real-world data sets showing that IGNs provide significant advances over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate how IGNs can be used to effectively model complex domains using neural network architectures.

**Abstract:** The task of continual learning requires careful design of algorithms that can tackle catastrophic forgetting. However, the noisy label, which is inevitable in a real-world scenario, seems to exacerbate the situation. While very few studies have addressed the issue of continual learning under noisy labels, long training time and complicated training schemes limit their applications in most cases. In contrast, we propose a simple purification technique to effectively cleanse the online data stream that is both cost-effective and more accurate. After purification, we perform fine-tuning in a semi-supervised fashion that ensures the participation of all available samples. Training in this fashion helps us learn a better representation that results in state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Through extensive experimentation on 3 benchmark datasets, MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, we show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We achieve a 24.8% performance gain for CIFAR10 with 20% noise over previous SOTA methods. Our code is publicly available.

**Abstract:** Deep learning on point clouds has received increased attention thanks to its wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured end-to-end speedup over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine and SpConv, respectively.

**Abstract:** Much attention has been paid to dynamical simulation and quantum machine learning (QML) independently as applications for quantum advantage, while the possibility of using QML to enhance dynamical simulations has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we develop a framework for using QML methods to simulate quantum dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. We use generalization bounds, which bound the error a machine learning model makes on unseen data, to rigorously analyze the training data requirements of an algorithm within this framework. This provides a guarantee that our algorithm is resource-efficient, both in terms of qubit and data requirements. Our numerics exhibit efficient scaling with problem size, and we simulate 20 times longer than Trotterization on IBMQ-Bogota.

**Abstract:** The 2021 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE21) was the latest cycle of the ongoing evaluation series conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) since 1996. It was the second large-scale multimodal speaker/person recognition evaluation organized by NIST (the first one being SRE19). Similar to SRE19, it featured two core evaluation tracks, namely audio and audio-visual, as well as an optional visual track. In addition to offering fixed and open training conditions, it also introduced new challenges for the community, thanks to a new multimodal (i.e., audio, video, and selfie images) and multilingual (i.e., with multilingual speakers) corpus, termed WeCanTalk, collected outside North America by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). These challenges included: 1) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test segments originating from different domains (i.e., telephony versus video), and 2) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test segments spoken in different languages (i.e., cross-lingual trials). This paper presents an overview of SRE21 including the tasks, performance metric, data, evaluation protocol, results and system performance analyses. A total of 23 organizations (forming 15 teams) from academia and industry participated in SRE21 and submitted 158 valid system outputs. Evaluation results indicate: audio-visual fusion produce substantial gains in performance over audio-only or visual-only systems; top performing speaker and face recognition systems exhibited comparable performance under the matched domain conditions present in this evaluation; and, the use of complex neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet) along with angular losses with margin, data augmentation, as well as long duration fine-tuning contributed to notable performance improvements for the audio-only speaker recognition task.

**Abstract:** Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) and plaque rupture have been recognized as the most frequent risk factor for thrombosis and acute coronary syndrome. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) can identify TCFA and assess cap thickness, which provides an opportunity to assess plaque vulnerability. We developed an automated method that can detect lipidous plaque and assess fibrous cap thickness in IVOCT images. This study analyzed a total of 4,360 IVOCT image frames of 77 lesions among 41 patients. To improve segmentation performance, preprocessing included lumen segmentation, pixel-shifting, and noise filtering on the raw polar (r, theta) IVOCT images. We used the DeepLab-v3 plus deep learning model to classify lipidous plaque pixels. After lipid detection, we automatically detected the outer border of the fibrous cap using a special dynamic programming algorithm and assessed the cap thickness. Our method provided excellent discriminability of lipid plaque with a sensitivity of 85.8% and A-line Dice coefficient of 0.837. By comparing lipid angle measurements between two analysts following editing of our automated software, we found good agreement by Bland-Altman analysis (difference 6.7+/-17 degree; mean 196 degree). Our method accurately detected the fibrous cap from the detected lipid plaque. Automated analysis required a significant modification for only 5.5% frames. Furthermore, our method showed a good agreement of fibrous cap thickness between two analysts with Bland-Altman analysis (4.2+/-14.6 micron; mean 175 micron), indicating little bias between users and good reproducibility of the measurement. We developed a fully automated method for fibrous cap quantification in IVOCT images, resulting in good agreement with determinations by analysts. The method has great potential to enable highly automated, repeatable, and comprehensive evaluations of TCFAs.

**Abstract:** Discrete-time modeling of acoustic, mechanical and electrical systems is a prominent topic in the musical signal processing literature. Such models are mostly derived by discretizing a mathematical model, given in terms of ordinary or partial differential equations, using established techniques. Recent work has applied the techniques of machine-learning to construct such models automatically from data for the case of systems which have lumped states described by scalar values, such as electrical circuits. In this work, we examine how similar techniques are able to construct models of systems which have spatially distributed rather than lumped states. We describe several novel recurrent neural network structures, and show how they can be thought of as an extension of modal techniques. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for three physical systems and show that the proposed network structures can be trained with this data to reproduce the behavior of these systems.

**Abstract:** Video decomposition is very important to extract moving foreground objects from complex backgrounds in computer vision, machine learning, and medical imaging, e.g., extracting moving contrast-filled vessels from the complex and noisy backgrounds of X-ray coronary angiography (XCA). However, the challenges caused by dynamic backgrounds, overlapping heterogeneous environments and complex noises still exist in video decomposition. To solve these problems, this study is the first to introduce a flexible visual working memory model in video decomposition tasks to provide interpretable and high-performance hierarchical deep architecture, integrating the transformative representations between sensory and control layers from the perspective of visual and cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, robust PCA unrolling networks acting as a structure-regularized sensor layer decompose XCA into sparse/low-rank structured representations to separate moving contrast-filled vessels from noisy and complex backgrounds. Then, patch recurrent convolutional LSTM networks with a backprojection module embody unstructured random representations of the control layer in working memory, recurrently projecting spatiotemporally decomposed nonlocal patches into orthogonal subspaces for heterogeneous vessel retrieval and interference suppression. This video decomposition deep architecture effectively restores the heterogeneous profiles of intensity and the geometries of moving objects against the complex background interferences. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate moving contrast-filled vessel extraction with excellent flexibility and computational efficiency.

**Abstract:** Indexing is an effective way to support efficient query processing in large databases. Recently the concept of learned index has been explored actively to replace or supplement traditional index structures with machine learning models to reduce storage and search costs. However, accurate and efficient similarity query processing in high-dimensional metric spaces remains to be an open challenge. In this paper, a novel indexing approach called LIMS is proposed to use data clustering and pivot-based data transformation techniques to build learned indexes for efficient similarity query processing in metric spaces. The underlying data is partitioned into clusters such that each cluster follows a relatively uniform data distribution. Data redistribution is achieved by utilizing a small number of pivots for each cluster. Similar data are mapped into compact regions and the mapped values are totally ordinal. Machine learning models are developed to approximate the position of each data record on the disk. Efficient algorithms are designed for processing range queries and nearest neighbor queries based on LIMS, and for index maintenance with dynamic updates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of LIMS compared with traditional indexes and state-of-the-art learned indexes.

**Abstract:** The growing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in safety- and security-critical areas like autonomous driving raises the need for their systematic testing. Coverage-guided testing (CGT) is an approach that applies mutation or fuzzing according to a predefined coverage metric to find inputs that cause misbehavior. With the introduction of a neuron coverage metric, CGT has also recently been applied to DNNs. In this work, we apply CGT to the task of person detection in crowded scenes. The proposed pipeline uses YOLOv3 for person detection and includes finding DNN bugs via sampling and mutation, and subsequent DNN retraining on the updated training set. To be a bug, we require a mutated image to cause a significant performance drop compared to a clean input. In accordance with the CGT, we also consider an additional requirement of increased coverage in the bug definition. In order to explore several types of robustness, our approach includes natural image transformations, corruptions, and adversarial examples generated with the Daedalus attack. The proposed framework has uncovered several thousand cases of incorrect DNN behavior. The relative change in mAP performance of the retrained models reached on average between 26.21\% and 64.24\% for different robustness types. However, we have found no evidence that the investigated coverage metrics can be advantageously used to improve robustness.

**Abstract:** In photoacoustic tomography (PAT) with flat sensor, we routinely encounter two types of limited data. The first is due to using a finite sensor and is especially perceptible if the region of interest is large relatively to the sensor or located farther away from the sensor. In this paper, we focus on the second type caused by a varying sensitivity of the sensor to the incoming wavefront direction which can be modelled as binary i.e. by a cone of sensitivity. Such visibility conditions result, in Fourier domain, in a restriction of both the image and the data to a bowtie, akin to the one corresponding to the range of the forward operator. The visible ranges, in image and data domains, are related by the wavefront direction mapping. We adapt the wedge restricted Curvelet decomposition, we previously proposed for the representation of the full PAT data, to separate the visible and invisible wavefronts in the image. We optimally combine fast approximate operators with tailored deep neural network architectures into efficient learned reconstruction methods which perform reconstruction of the visible coefficients and the invisible coefficients are learned from a training set of similar data.

**Abstract:** Scientists frequently prioritize learning from data rather than training the best possible model; however, research in machine learning often prioritizes the latter. The development of marginal feature importance methods, such as marginal contribution feature importance, attempts to break this trend by providing a useful framework for explaining relationships in data in an interpretable fashion. In this work, we generalize the framework of marginal contribution feature importance to improve performance with regards to detecting correlated interactions and reducing runtime. To do so, we consider "information subsets" of the set of features $F$ and show that our importance metric can be computed directly after applying fair representation learning methods from the AI fairness literature. The methods of optimal transport and linear regression are considered and explored experimentally for removing all the information of our feature of interest $f$ from the feature set $F$. Given these implementations, we show on real and simulated data that ultra marginal feature importance performs at least as well as marginal contribution feature importance, with substantially faster computation time and better performance in the presence of correlated interactions and unrelated features.

**Abstract:** Unsupervised person re-identification is a challenging and promising task in the computer vision. Nowadays unsupervised person re-identification methods have achieved great improvements by training with pseudo labels. However, the appearance and label noise are less explicitly studied in the unsupervised manner. To relieve the effects of appearance noise the global features involved, we also take into account the features from two local views and produce multi-scale features. We explore the knowledge distillation to filter label noise, Specifically, we first train a teacher model from noisy pseudo labels in a iterative way, and then use the teacher model to guide the learning of our student model. In our setting, the student model could converge fast in the supervision of the teacher model thus reduce the interference of noisy labels as the teacher model greatly suffered. After carefully handling the noises in the feature learning, Our multi-scale knowledge distillation are proven to be very effective in the unsupervised re-identification. Extensive experiments on three popular person re-identification datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, our approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy 85.7% @mAP or 94.3% @Rank-1 on the challenging Market-1501 benchmark with ResNet-50 under the fully unsupervised setting.

**Abstract:** The task of 2D human pose estimation is challenging as the number of keypoints is typically large (~ 17) and this necessitates the use of robust neural network architectures and training pipelines that can capture the relevant features from the input image. These features are then aggregated to make accurate heatmap predictions from which the final keypoints of human body parts can be inferred. Many papers in literature use CNN-based architectures for the backbone, and/or combine it with a transformer, after which the features are aggregated to make the final keypoint predictions [1]. In this paper, we consider the recently proposed Bottleneck Transformers [2], which combine CNN and multi-head self attention (MHSA) layers effectively, and we integrate it with a Transformer encoder and apply it to the task of 2D human pose estimation. We consider different backbone architectures and pre-train them using the DINO self-supervised learning method [3], this pre-training is found to improve the overall prediction accuracy. We call our model BTranspose, and experiments show that on the COCO validation set, our model achieves an AP of 76.4, which is competitive with other methods such as [1] and has fewer network parameters. Furthermore, we also present the dependencies of the final predicted keypoints on both the MHSA block and the Transformer encoder layers, providing clues on the image sub-regions the network attends to at the mid and high levels.

**Abstract:** Melanoma is the most malignant skin tumor and usually cancerates from normal moles, which is difficult to distinguish benign from malignant in the early stage. Therefore, many machine learning methods are trying to make auxiliary prediction. However, these methods attach more attention to the image data of suspected tumor, and focus on improving the accuracy of image classification, but ignore the significance of patient-level contextual information for disease diagnosis in actual clinical diagnosis. To make more use of patient information and improve the accuracy of diagnosis, we propose a new melanoma classification model based on EffNet and Resnet. Our model not only uses images within the same patient but also consider patient-level contextual information for better cancer prediction. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model achieved 0.981 ACC. Furthermore, we note that the overall ROC value of the model is 0.976 which is better than the previous state-of-the-art approaches.

**Abstract:** Fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) aims to discriminate similar subcategories, whose main challenge is the large intraclass diversities and subtle inter-class differences. Existing FGVC methods usually select discriminant regions found by a trained model, which is prone to neglect other potential discriminant information. On the other hand, the massive interactions between the sequence of image patches in ViT make the resulting class-token contain lots of redundant information, which may also impacts FGVC performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for FGVC, which can simultaneously make use of partial yet sufficient discriminative information in environmental cues and also compress the redundant information in class-token with respect to the target. Specifically, our model calculates the ratio of high-weight regions in a batch, adaptively adjusts the masking threshold and achieves moderate extraction of background information in the input space. Moreover, we also use the Information Bottleneck~(IB) approach to guide our network to learn a minimum sufficient representations in the feature space. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmark datasets verify that our approach can achieve outperforming performance than other state-of-the-art approaches and baseline models.

**Abstract:** In order to make autonomous driving a reality, artificial neural networks have to work reliably in the open-world. However, the open-world is vast and continuously changing, so it is not technically feasible to collect and annotate training datasets which accurately represent this domain. Therefore, there are always domain gaps between training datasets and the open-world which must be understood. In this work, we investigate the domain gaps between high-resolution and low-resolution LiDAR sensors in object detection networks. Using a unique dataset, which enables us to study sensor resolution domain gaps independent of other effects, we show two distinct domain gaps - an inference domain gap and a training domain gap. The inference domain gap is characterised by a strong dependence on the number of LiDAR points per object, while the training gap shows no such dependence. These fndings show that different approaches are required to close these inference and training domain gaps.

**Abstract:** In healthcare prediction tasks, it is essential to exploit the correlations between medical features and learn better patient health representations. Existing methods try to estimate feature correlations only from data, or increase the quality of estimation by introducing task-specific medical knowledge. However, such methods either are difficult to estimate the feature correlations due to insufficient training samples, or cannot be generalized to other tasks due to reliance on specific knowledge. There are medical research revealing that not all the medical features are strongly correlated. Thus, to address the issues, we expect to group up strongly correlated features and learn feature correlations in a group-wise manner to reduce the learning complexity without losing generality. In this paper, we propose a general patient health representation learning framework MedFACT. We estimate correlations via measuring similarity between temporal patterns of medical features with kernel methods, and cluster features with strong correlations into groups. The feature group is further formulated as a correlation graph, and we employ graph convolutional networks to conduct group-wise feature interactions for better representation learning. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedFACT. The discovered medical findings are also confirmed by literature, providing valuable medical insights and explanations.

**Abstract:** We propose an analog implementation of the transcendental activation function leveraging two spin-orbit torque magnetoresistive random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) devices and a CMOS inverter. The proposed analog neuron circuit consumes 1.8-27x less power, and occupies 2.5-4931x smaller area, compared to the state-of-the-art analog and digital implementations. Moreover, the developed neuron can be readily integrated with memristive crossbars without requiring any intermediate signal conversion units. The architecture-level analyses show that a fully-analog in-memory computing (IMC) circuit that use our SOT-MRAM neuron along with an SOT-MRAM based crossbar can achieve more than 1.1x, 12x, and 13.3x reduction in power, latency, and energy, respectively, compared to a mixed-signal implementation with analog memristive crossbars and digital neurons. Finally, through cross-layer analyses, we provide a guide on how varying the device-level parameters in our neuron can affect the accuracy of multilayer perceptron (MLP) for MNIST classification.

**Abstract:** The automated Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) classification technique is essential for assisting clinicians during the diagnosis process. Detecting and classifying ILDs patterns is a challenging problem. This paper introduces an end-to-end deep convolution neural network (CNN) for classifying ILDs patterns. The proposed model comprises four convolutional layers with different kernel sizes and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, followed by batch normalization and max-pooling with a size equal to the final feature map size well as four dense layers. We used the ADAM optimizer to minimize categorical cross-entropy. A dataset consisting of 21328 image patches of 128 CT scans with five classes is taken to train and assess the proposed model. A comparison study showed that the presented model outperformed pre-trained CNNs and five-fold cross-validation on the same dataset. For ILDs pattern classification, the proposed approach achieved the accuracy scores of 99.09% and the average F score of 97.9%, outperforming three pre-trained CNNs. These outcomes show that the proposed model is relatively state-of-the-art in precision, recall, f score, and accuracy.

**Abstract:** The reconstruction of electrons and photons in CMS depends on topological clustering of the energy deposited by an incident particle in different crystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). These clusters are formed by aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology of an electromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material (beampipe, tracker and support structures) causes electrons and photons to start showering before reaching the calorimeter. This effect, combined with the 3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters around the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in these satellite clusters in order to achieve the best possible energy resolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite clusters have been associated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which does not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup interactions (PU). The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade during LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger average PU levels and the increasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods are being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning architectures like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms. These more sophisticated models improve the energy collection and are more resilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and photon energy resolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2. This work will cover the challenges of training the models as well the opportunity that this new approach offers to unify the ECAL energy measurement with the particle identification steps used in the global CMS photon and electron reconstruction.

**Abstract:** Actor-critic algorithms that make use of distributional policy evaluation have frequently been shown to outperform their non-distributional counterparts on many challenging control tasks. Examples of this behavior include the D4PG and DMPO algorithms as compared to DDPG and MPO, respectively [Barth-Maron et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2020]. However, both agents rely on the C51 critic for value estimation.One major drawback of the C51 approach is its requirement of prior knowledge about the minimum andmaximum values a policy can attain as well as the number of bins used, which fixes the resolution ofthe distributional estimate. While the DeepMind control suite of tasks utilizes standardized rewards and episode lengths, thus enabling the entire suite to be solved with a single setting of these hyperparameters, this is often not the case. This paper revisits a natural alternative that removes this requirement, namelya mixture of Gaussians, and a simple sample-based loss function to train it in an off-policy regime. We empirically evaluate its performance on a broad range of continuous control tasks and demonstrate that it eliminates the need for these distributional hyperparameters and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of challenging tasks (e.g. the humanoid, dog, quadruped, and manipulator domains). Finallywe provide an implementation in the Acme agent repository.

**Abstract:** Support vector machines (SVMs) are popular learning algorithms to deal with binary classification problems. They traditionally assume equal misclassification costs for each class; however, real-world problems may have an uneven class distribution. This article introduces EBCS-SVM: evolutionary bilevel cost-sensitive SVMs. EBCS-SVM handles imbalanced classification problems by simultaneously learning the support vectors and optimizing the SVM hyperparameters, which comprise the kernel parameter and misclassification costs. The resulting optimization problem is a bilevel problem, where the lower level determines the support vectors and the upper level the hyperparameters. This optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) at the upper level and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) at the lower level. These two methods work in a nested fashion, that is, the optimal support vectors help guide the search of the hyperparameters, and the lower level is initialized based on previous successful solutions. The proposed method is assessed using 70 datasets of imbalanced classification and compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results, supported by a Bayesian test, provided evidence of the effectiveness of EBCS-SVM when working with highly imbalanced datasets.

**Abstract:** The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how healthcare is delivered to patients, how patients interact with healthcare providers, and how healthcare information is disseminated to both healthcare providers and patients. Analytical models that were trained and tested pre-pandemic may no longer be performing up to expectations, providing unreliable and irrelevant learning (ML) models given that ML depends on the basic principle that what happened in the past are likely to repeat in the future. ML faced to two important degradation principles, concept drift, when the underlying properties and characteristics of the variables change and data drift, when the data distributions, probabilities, co-variates, and other variable relationships change, both of which are prime culprits of model failure. Therefore, detecting and diagnosing drift in existing models is something that has become an imperative. And perhaps even more important is a shift in our mindset towards a conscious recognition that drift is inevitable, and model building must incorporate intentional resilience, the ability to offset and recover quickly from failure, and proactive robustness, avoiding failure by developing models that are less vulnerable to drift and disruption.

**Abstract:** Urban traffic flow prediction using data-driven models can play an important role in route planning and preventing congestion on highways. These methods utilize data collected from traffic recording stations at different timestamps to predict the future status of traffic. Hence, data collection, transmission, storage, and extraction techniques can have a significant impact on the performance of the traffic flow model. On the other hand, a comprehensive database can provide the opportunity for using complex, yet reliable predictive models such as deep learning methods. However, most of these methods have difficulties in handling missing values and outliers. This study focuses on hybrid deep neural networks to predict traffic flow in the California Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) with missing values. The proposed networks are based on a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to consider the temporal dependencies in the data recorded in each station and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to take the spatial correlations in the adjacent stations into account. Various architecture configurations with series and parallel connections are considered based on RNNs and CNNs, and several prevalent data imputation techniques are used to examine the robustness of the hybrid networks to missing values. A comprehensive analysis performed on two different datasets from PeMS indicates that the proposed series-parallel hybrid network with the mean imputation technique achieves the lowest error in predicting the traffic flow and is robust to missing values up until 21% missing ratio in both complete and incomplete training data scenarios when applied to an incomplete test data.

**Abstract:** Compared with other imaging modalities, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has significant advantages for guiding percutaneous coronary interventions. To aid IVOCT research studies, we developed the Optical Coherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) analysis software. To automate image analysis results, the software includes several important algorithmic steps: pre-processing, deep learning plaque segmentation, machine learning identification of stent struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive visualization and manual editing of segmentations were included in the software. Quantifications include stent deployment characteristics (e.g., stent strut malapposition), strut level analysis, calcium angle, and calcium thickness measurements. Interactive visualizations include (x,y) anatomical, en face, and longitudinal views with optional overlays. Underlying plaque segmentation algorithm yielded excellent pixel-wise results (86.2% sensitivity and 0.781 F1 score). Using OCTOPUS on 34 new pullbacks, we determined that following automated segmentation, only 13% and 23% of frames needed any manual touch up for detailed lumen and calcification labeling, respectively. Only up to 3.8% of plaque pixels were modified, leading to an average editing time of only 7.5 seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to manual analysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity and precision were both greater than 90%, and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or uncovered with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and evaluated the clinical application of a highly automated software package, OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images. The software is currently used as an offline tool for research purposes; however, the software's embedded algorithms may also be useful for real-time treatment planning.

**Abstract:** Counterfactual explanations are increasingly used to address interpretability, recourse, and bias in AI decisions. However, we do not know how well counterfactual explanations help users to understand a systems decisions, since no large scale user studies have compared their efficacy to other sorts of explanations such as causal explanations (which have a longer track record of use in rule based and decision tree models). It is also unknown whether counterfactual explanations are equally effective for categorical as for continuous features, although current methods assume they do. Hence, in a controlled user study with 127 volunteer participants, we tested the effects of counterfactual and causal explanations on the objective accuracy of users predictions of the decisions made by a simple AI system, and participants subjective judgments of satisfaction and trust in the explanations. We discovered a dissociation between objective and subjective measures: counterfactual explanations elicit higher accuracy of predictions than no-explanation control descriptions but no higher accuracy than causal explanations, yet counterfactual explanations elicit greater satisfaction and trust than causal explanations. We also found that users understand explanations referring to categorical features more readily than those referring to continuous features. We discuss the implications of these findings for current and future counterfactual methods in XAI.

**Abstract:** Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user behaviour. Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been proposed to improve recommendation performance. However, most of existing SSL methods use a uniform data augmentation scheme, which loses the sequence correlation of an original sequence. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Learnable Model Augmentation self-supervised learning for sequential Recommendation (LMA4Rec). Specifically, LMA4Rec first takes model augmentation as a supplementary method for data augmentation to generate views. Then, LMA4Rec uses learnable Bernoulli dropout to implement model augmentation learnable operations. Next, self-supervised learning is used between the contrastive views to extract self-supervised signals from an original sequence. Finally, experiments on three public datasets show that the LMA4Rec method effectively improves sequential recommendation performance compared with baseline methods.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning. Despite their rapid development, GNNs also faces some challenges, such as over-fitting, over-smoothing, and non-robustness. Previous works indicate that these problems can be alleviated by random dropping methods, which integrate noises into models by randomly masking parts of the input. However, some open-ended problems of random dropping on GNNs remain to solve. First, it is challenging to find a universal method that are suitable for all cases considering the divergence of different datasets and models. Second, random noises introduced to GNNs cause the incomplete coverage of parameters and unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel random dropping method called DropMessage, which performs dropping operations directly on the message matrix and can be applied to any message-passing GNNs. Furthermore, we elaborate the superiority of DropMessage: it stabilizes the training process by reducing sample variance; it keeps information diversity from the perspective of information theory, which makes it a theoretical upper bound of other methods. Also, we unify existing random dropping methods into our framework and analyze their effects on GNNs. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments that aims for multiple tasks on five public datasets and two industrial datasets with various backbone models. The experimental results show that DropMessage has both advantages of effectiveness and generalization.

**Abstract:** Outlier detection is an important topic in machine learning and has been used in a wide range of applications. Outliers are objects that are few in number and deviate from the majority of objects. As a result of these two properties, we show that outliers are susceptible to a mechanism called fluctuation. This article proposes a method called fluctuation-based outlier detection (FBOD) that achieves a low linear time complexity and detects outliers purely based on the concept of fluctuation without employing any distance, density or isolation measure. Fundamentally different from all existing methods. FBOD first converts the Euclidean structure datasets into graphs by using random links, then propagates the feature value according to the connection of the graph. Finally, by comparing the difference between the fluctuation of an object and its neighbors, FBOD determines the object with a larger difference as an outlier. The results of experiments comparing FBOD with seven state-of-the-art algorithms on eight real-world tabular datasets and three video datasets show that FBOD outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases and that FBOD has only 5% of the execution time of the fastest algorithm. The experiment codes are available at: https://github.com/FluctuationOD/Fluctuation-based-Outlier-Detection.
