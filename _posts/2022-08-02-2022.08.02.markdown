**Abstract:** Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through natural language. Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes. In other words, we ask: how can we use language-guided models to turn our cat into a painting, or imagine a new product based on our favorite toy? Here we present a simple approach that allows such creative freedom. Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept, like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new "words" in the embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model. These "words" can be composed into natural language sentences, guiding personalized creation in an intuitive way. Notably, we find evidence that a single word embedding is sufficient for capturing unique and varied concepts. We compare our approach to a wide range of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts across a range of applications and tasks.
  Our code, data and new words will be available at: https://textual-inversion.github.io

**Abstract:** In this work, we demonstrate that multilingual large-scale sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, pre-trained on a mixture of denoising and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) tasks, are more efficient few-shot learners than decoder-only models on various tasks. In particular, we train a 20 billion parameter multilingual seq2seq model called Alexa Teacher Model (AlexaTM 20B) and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 1-shot summarization tasks, outperforming a much larger 540B PaLM decoder model. AlexaTM 20B also achieves SOTA in 1-shot machine translation, especially for low-resource languages, across almost all language pairs supported by the model (Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Marathi, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, and Telugu) on Flores-101 dataset. We also show in zero-shot setting, AlexaTM 20B outperforms GPT3 (175B) on SuperGLUE and SQuADv2 datasets and provides SOTA performance on multilingual tasks such as XNLI, XCOPA, Paws-X, and XWinograd. Overall, our results present a compelling case for seq2seq models as a powerful alternative to decoder-only models for Large-scale Language Model (LLM) training.

**Abstract:** The development of autonomous agents which can interact with other agents to accomplish a given task is a core area of research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Towards this goal, the Autonomous Agents Research Group develops novel machine learning algorithms for autonomous systems control, with a specific focus on deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Research problems include scalable learning of coordinated agent policies and inter-agent communication; reasoning about the behaviours, goals, and composition of other agents from limited observations; and sample-efficient learning based on intrinsic motivation, curriculum learning, causal inference, and representation learning. This article provides a broad overview of the ongoing research portfolio of the group and discusses open problems for future directions.

**Abstract:** Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Such text-based synthesis methods are particularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their intent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis to text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis by editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.

**Abstract:** This paper presents an open and comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate state-of-the-art contributions to self-supervised monocular depth estimation. This includes pretraining, backbone, architectural design choices and loss functions. Many papers in this field claim novelty in either architecture design or loss formulation. However, simply updating the backbone of historical systems results in relative improvements of 25%, allowing them to outperform the majority of existing systems. A systematic evaluation of papers in this field was not straightforward. The need to compare like-with-like in previous papers means that longstanding errors in the evaluation protocol are ubiquitous in the field. It is likely that many papers were not only optimized for particular datasets, but also for errors in the data and evaluation criteria. To aid future research in this area, we release a modular codebase, allowing for easy evaluation of alternate design decisions against corrected data and evaluation criteria. We re-implement, validate and re-evaluate 16 state-of-the-art contributions and introduce a new dataset (SYNS-Patches) containing dense outdoor depth maps in a variety of both natural and urban scenes. This allows for the computation of informative metrics in complex regions such as depth boundaries.

**Abstract:** Leveraging labelled data from multiple domains to enable prediction in another domain without labels is a significant, yet challenging problem. To address this problem, we introduce the framework DAPDAG (\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation via \textbf{P}erturbed \textbf{DAG} Reconstruction) and propose to learn an auto-encoder that undertakes inference on population statistics given features and reconstructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as an auxiliary task. The underlying DAG structure is assumed invariant among observed variables whose conditional distributions are allowed to vary across domains led by a latent environmental variable $E$. The encoder is designed to serve as an inference device on $E$ while the decoder reconstructs each observed variable conditioned on its graphical parents in the DAG and the inferred $E$. We train the encoder and decoder jointly in an end-to-end manner and conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets with mixed variables. Empirical results demonstrate that reconstructing the DAG benefits the approximate inference. Furthermore, our approach can achieve competitive performance against other benchmarks in prediction tasks, with better adaptation ability, especially in the target domain significantly different from the source domains.

**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of social networks and the convenience of internet availability have accelerated the rampant spread of false news and rumors on social media sites. Amid the COVID 19 epidemic, this misleading information has aggravated the situation by putting peoples mental and physical lives in danger. To limit the spread of such inaccuracies, identifying the fake news from online platforms could be the first and foremost step. In this research, the authors have conducted a comparative analysis by implementing five transformer based models such as BERT, BERT without LSTM, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and a Hybrid of BERT & ALBERT in order to detect the fraudulent news of COVID 19 from the internet. COVID 19 Fake News Dataset has been used for training and testing the models. Among all these models, the RoBERTa model has performed better than other models by obtaining an F1 score of 0.98 in both real and fake classes.

**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks have got the researchers' attention due to their state-of-the-art performance in generating new images with only a dataset of the target distribution. It has been shown that there is a dissimilarity between the spectrum of authentic images and fake ones. Since the Fourier transform is a bijective mapping, saying that the model has a significant problem in learning the original distribution is a fair conclusion. In this work, we investigate the possible reasons for the mentioned drawback in the architecture and mathematical theory of the current GANs. Then we propose a new model to reduce the discrepancies between the spectrum of the actual and fake images. To that end, we design a brand new architecture for the frequency domain using the blueprint of geometric deep learning. Then, we experimentally show promising improvements in the quality of the generated images by considering the Fourier domain representation of the original data as a principal feature in the training process.

**Abstract:** Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is information describing threat vectors, vulnerabilities, and attacks and is often used as training data for AI-based cyber defense systems such as Cybersecurity Knowledge Graphs (CKG). There is a strong need to develop community-accessible datasets to train existing AI-based cybersecurity pipelines to efficiently and accurately extract meaningful insights from CTI. We have created an initial unstructured CTI corpus from a variety of open sources that we are using to train and test cybersecurity entity models using the spaCy framework and exploring self-learning methods to automatically recognize cybersecurity entities. We also describe methods to apply cybersecurity domain entity linking with existing world knowledge from Wikidata. Our future work will survey and test spaCy NLP tools and create methods for continuous integration of new information extracted from text.

**Abstract:** In this work, we evaluate how neural networks with periodic activation functions can be leveraged to reliably compress large multidimensional medical image datasets, with proof-of-concept application to 4D diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). In the medical imaging landscape, multidimensional MRI is a key area of research for developing biomarkers that are both sensitive and specific to the underlying tissue microstructure. However, the high-dimensional nature of these data poses a challenge in terms of both storage and sharing capabilities and associated costs, requiring appropriate algorithms able to represent the information in a low-dimensional space. Recent theoretical developments in deep learning have shown how periodic activation functions are a powerful tool for implicit neural representation of images and can be used for compression of 2D images. Here we extend this approach to 4D images and show how any given 4D dMRI dataset can be accurately represented through the parameters of a sinusoidal activation network, achieving a data compression rate about 10 times higher than the standard DEFLATE algorithm. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms benchmark ReLU and Tanh activation perceptron architectures in terms of mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index. Subsequent analyses using the tensor and spherical harmonics representations demonstrate that the proposed lossy compression reproduces accurately the characteristics of the original data, leading to relative errors about 5 to 10 times lower than the benchmark JPEG2000 lossy compression and similar to standard pre-processing steps such as MP-PCA denosing, suggesting a loss of information within the currently accepted levels for clinical application.

**Abstract:** The automatic segmentation of blood vessels in fundus images can help analyze the condition of retinal vasculature, which is crucial for identifying various systemic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, etc. Despite the success of Deep Learning-based models in this segmentation task, most of them are heavily parametrized and thus have limited use in practical applications. This paper proposes IterMiUnet, a new lightweight convolution-based segmentation model that requires significantly fewer parameters and yet delivers performance similar to existing models. The model makes use of the excellent segmentation capabilities of Iternet architecture but overcomes its heavily parametrized nature by incorporating the encoder-decoder structure of MiUnet model within it. Thus, the new model reduces parameters without any compromise with the network's depth, which is necessary to learn abstract hierarchical concepts in deep models. This lightweight segmentation model speeds up training and inference time and is potentially helpful in the medical domain where data is scarce and, therefore, heavily parametrized models tend to overfit. The proposed model was evaluated on three publicly available datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1. Further cross-training and inter-rater variability evaluations have also been performed. The proposed model has a lot of potential to be utilized as a tool for the early diagnosis of many diseases.

**Abstract:** Native language identification (NLI) is the task of training (via supervised machine learning) a classifier that guesses the native language of the author of a text. This task has been extensively researched in the last decade, and the performance of NLI systems has steadily improved over the years. We focus on a different facet of the NLI task, i.e., that of analysing the internals of an NLI classifier trained by an \emph{explainable} machine learning algorithm, in order to obtain explanations of its classification decisions, with the ultimate goal of gaining insight into which linguistic phenomena ``give a speaker's native language away''. We use this perspective in order to tackle both NLI and a (much less researched) companion task, i.e., guessing whether a text has been written by a native or a non-native speaker. Using three datasets of different provenance (two datasets of English learners' essays and a dataset of social media posts), we investigate which kind of linguistic traits (lexical, morphological, syntactic, and statistical) are most effective for solving our two tasks, namely, are most indicative of a speaker's L1. We also present two case studies, one on Spanish and one on Italian learners of English, in which we analyse individual linguistic traits that the classifiers have singled out as most important for spotting these L1s. Overall, our study shows that the use of explainable machine learning can be a valuable tool for th

**Abstract:** Entailment trees have been proposed to simulate the human reasoning process of explanation generation in the context of open--domain textual question answering. However, in practice, manually constructing these explanation trees proves a laborious process that requires active human involvement. Given the complexity of capturing the line of reasoning from question to the answer or from claim to premises, the issue arises of how to assist the user in efficiently constructing multi--level entailment trees given a large set of available facts. In this paper, we frame the construction of entailment trees as a sequence of active premise selection steps, i.e., for each intermediate node in an explanation tree, the expert needs to annotate positive and negative examples of premise facts from a large candidate list. We then iteratively fine--tune pre--trained Transformer models with the resulting positive and tightly controlled negative samples and aim to balance the encoding of semantic relationships and explanatory entailment relationships. Experimental evaluation confirms the measurable efficiency gains of the proposed active fine--tuning method in facilitating entailment trees construction: up to 20\% improvement in explanatory premise selection when compared against several alternatives.

**Abstract:** The advent of machine learning models that surpass human decision-making ability in complex domains has initiated a movement towards building AI systems that interact with humans. Many building blocks are essential for this activity, with a central one being the algorithmic characterization of human behavior. While much of the existing work focuses on aggregate human behavior, an important long-range goal is to develop behavioral models that specialize to individual people and can differentiate among them.
  To formalize this process, we study the problem of behavioral stylometry, in which the task is to identify a decision-maker from their decisions alone. We present a transformer-based approach to behavioral stylometry in the context of chess, where one attempts to identify the player who played a set of games. Our method operates in a few-shot classification framework, and can correctly identify a player from among thousands of candidate players with 98% accuracy given only 100 labeled games. Even when trained on amateur play, our method generalises to out-of-distribution samples of Grandmaster players, despite the dramatic differences between amateur and world-class players. Finally, we consider more broadly what our resulting embeddings reveal about human style in chess, as well as the potential ethical implications of powerful methods for identifying individuals from behavioral data.

**Abstract:** Causal relation extraction of biomedical entities is one of the most complex tasks in biomedical text mining, which involves two kinds of information: entity relations and entity functions. One feasible approach is to take relation extraction and function detection as two independent sub-tasks. However, this separate learning method ignores the intrinsic correlation between them and leads to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a joint learning model, which combines entity relation extraction and entity function detection to exploit their commonality and capture their inter-relationship, so as to improve the performance of biomedical causal relation extraction. Meanwhile, during the model training stage, different function types in the loss function are assigned different weights. Specifically, the penalty coefficient for negative function instances increases to effectively improve the precision of function detection. Experimental results on the BioCreative-V Track 4 corpus show that our joint learning model outperforms the separate models in BEL statement extraction, achieving the F1 scores of 58.4% and 37.3% on the test set in Stage 2 and Stage 1 evaluations, respectively. This demonstrates that our joint learning system reaches the state-of-the-art performance in Stage 2 compared with other systems.

**Abstract:** Existing multiparty dialogue datasets for coreference resolution are nascent, and many challenges are still unaddressed. We create a large-scale dataset, Multilingual Multiparty Coref (MMC), for this task based on TV transcripts. Due to the availability of gold-quality subtitles in multiple languages, we propose reusing the annotations to create silver coreference data in other languages (Chinese and Farsi) via annotation projection. On the gold (English) data, off-the-shelf models perform relatively poorly on MMC, suggesting that MMC has broader coverage of multiparty coreference than prior datasets. On the silver data, we find success both using it for data augmentation and training from scratch, which effectively simulates the zero-shot cross-lingual setting.

**Abstract:** With the rapid growth of software scale and complexity, a large number of bug reports are submitted to the bug tracking system. In order to speed up defect repair, these reports need to be accurately classified so that they can be sent to the appropriate developers. However, the existing classification methods only use the text information of the bug report, which leads to their low performance. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new automatic classification method for bug reports. The innovation is that when categorizing bug reports, in addition to using the text information of the report, the intention of the report (i.e. suggestion or explanation) is also considered, thereby improving the performance of the classification. First, we collect bug reports from four ecosystems (Apache, Eclipse, Gentoo, Mozilla) and manually annotate them to construct an experimental data set. Then, we use Natural Language Processing technology to preprocess the data. On this basis, BERT and TF-IDF are used to extract the features of the intention and the multiple text information. Finally, the features are used to train the classifiers. The experimental result on five classifiers (including K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest) show that our proposed method achieves better performance and its F-Measure achieves from 87.3% to 95.5%.

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled major advances in image classification through convolution and pooling. In particular, image pooling transforms a connected discrete grid into a reduced grid with the same connectivity and allows reduction functions to take into account all the pixels of an image. However, a pooling satisfying such properties does not exist for graphs. Indeed, some methods are based on a vertex selection step which induces an important loss of information. Other methods learn a fuzzy clustering of vertex sets which induces almost complete reduced graphs. We propose to overcome both problems using a new pooling method, named MIVSPool. This method is based on a selection of vertices called surviving vertices using a Maximal Independent Vertex Set (MIVS) and an assignment of the remaining vertices to the survivors. Consequently, our method does not discard any vertex information nor artificially increase the density of the graph. Experimental results show an increase in accuracy for graph classification on various standard datasets.

**Abstract:** Diabetes Mellitus (DM) can lead to significant microvasculature disruptions that eventually causes diabetic retinopathy (DR), or complications in the eye due to diabetes. If left unchecked, this disease can increase over time and eventually cause complete vision loss. The general method to detect such optical developments is through examining the vessels, optic nerve head, microaneurysms, haemorrhage, exudates, etc. from retinal images. Ultimately this is limited by the number of experienced ophthalmologists and the vastly growing number of DM cases. To enable earlier and efficient DR diagnosis, the field of ophthalmology requires robust computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Our review is intended for anyone, from student to established researcher, who wants to understand what can be accomplished with CAD systems and their algorithms to modeling and where the field of retinal image processing in computer vision and pattern recognition is headed. For someone just getting started, we place a special emphasis on the logic, strengths and shortcomings of different databases and algorithms frameworks with a focus on very recent approaches.

**Abstract:** Extracting knowledge from unlabeled texts using machine learning algorithms can be complex. Document categorization and information retrieval are two applications that may benefit from unsupervised learning (e.g., text clustering and topic modeling), including exploratory data analysis. However, the unsupervised learning paradigm poses reproducibility issues. The initialization can lead to variability depending on the machine learning algorithm. Furthermore, the distortions can be misleading when regarding cluster geometry. Amongst the causes, the presence of outliers and anomalies can be a determining factor. Despite the relevance of initialization and outlier issues for text clustering and topic modeling, the authors did not find an in-depth analysis of them. This survey provides a systematic literature review (2011-2022) of these subareas and proposes a common terminology since similar procedures have different terms. The authors describe research opportunities, trends, and open issues. The appendices summarize the theoretical background of the text vectorization, the factorization, and the clustering algorithms that are directly or indirectly related to the reviewed works.

**Abstract:** The Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) will advance the operational effectiveness of infantry units. However, this requires autonomous assets such as sensors, drones, combat equipment, and uncrewed vehicles to collaborate, securely share information, and be resilient to adversary attacks in contested multi-domain operations. CAPD addresses this problem by providing a context-aware, policy-driven framework supporting data and knowledge exchange among autonomous entities in a battlespace. We propose an IoBT ontology that facilitates controlled information sharing to enable semantic interoperability between systems. Its key contributions include providing a knowledge graph with a shared semantic schema, integration with background knowledge, efficient mechanisms for enforcing data consistency and drawing inferences, and supporting attribute-based access control. The sensors in the IoBT provide data that create populated knowledge graphs based on the ontology. This paper describes using CAPD to detect and mitigate adversary actions. CAPD enables situational awareness using reasoning over the sensed data and SPARQL queries. For example, adversaries can cause sensor failure or hijacking and disrupt the tactical networks to degrade video surveillance. In such instances, CAPD uses an ontology-based reasoner to see how alternative approaches can still support the mission. Depending on bandwidth availability, the reasoner initiates the creation of a reduced frame rate grayscale video by active transcoding or transmits only still images. This ability to reason over the mission sensed environment and attack context permits the autonomous IoBT system to exhibit resilience in contested conditions.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence holds great promise in medical imaging, especially histopathological imaging. However, artificial intelligence algorithms cannot fully explain the thought processes during decision-making. This situation has brought the problem of explainability, i.e., the black box problem, of artificial intelligence applications to the agenda: an algorithm simply responds without stating the reasons for the given images. To overcome the problem and improve the explainability, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has come to the fore, and piqued the interest of many researchers. Against this backdrop, this study examines a new and original dataset using the deep learning algorithm, and visualizes the output with gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), one of the XAI applications. Afterwards, a detailed questionnaire survey was conducted with the pathologists on these images. Both the decision-making processes and the explanations were verified, and the accuracy of the output was tested. The research results greatly help pathologists in the diagnosis of paratuberculosis.

**Abstract:** Similar to many Machine Learning models, both accuracy and speed of the Cluster weighted models (CWMs) can be hampered by high-dimensional data, leading to previous works on a parsimonious technique to reduce the effect of "Curse of dimensionality" on mixture models. In this work, we review the background study of the cluster weighted models (CWMs). We further show that parsimonious technique is not sufficient for mixture models to thrive in the presence of huge high-dimensional data. We discuss a heuristic for detecting the hidden components by choosing the initial values of location parameters using the default values in the "FlexCWM" R package. We introduce a dimensionality reduction technique called T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE) to enhance the parsimonious CWMs in high-dimensional space. Originally, CWMs are suited for regression but for classification purposes, all multi-class variables are transformed logarithmically with some noise. The parameters of the model are obtained via expectation maximization algorithm. The effectiveness of the discussed technique is demonstrated using real data sets from different fields.

**Abstract:** Causal relationships are commonly examined in manufacturing processes to support faults investigations, perform interventions, and make strategic decisions. Industry 4.0 has made available an increasing amount of data that enable data-driven Causal Discovery (CD). Considering the growing number of recently proposed CD methods, it is necessary to introduce strict benchmarking procedures on publicly available datasets since they represent the foundation for a fair comparison and validation of different methods. This work introduces two novel public datasets for CD in continuous manufacturing processes. The first dataset employs the well-known Tennessee Eastman simulator for fault detection and process control. The second dataset is extracted from an ultra-processed food manufacturing plant, and it includes a description of the plant, as well as multiple ground truths. These datasets are used to propose a benchmarking procedure based on different metrics and evaluated on a wide selection of CD algorithms. This work allows testing CD methods in realistic conditions enabling the selection of the most suitable method for specific target applications. The datasets are available at the following link: https://github.com/giovanniMen

**Abstract:** Recent deep learning (DL) applications are mostly built on top of DL libraries. The quality assurance of these libraries is critical to the dependable deployment of DL applications. A few techniques have thereby been proposed to test DL libraries by generating DL models as test inputs. Then these techniques feed those DL models to DL libraries for making inferences, in order to exercise DL libraries modules related to a DL model's execution. However, the test effectiveness of these techniques is constrained by the diversity of generated DL models. Our investigation finds that these techniques can cover at most 11.7% of layer pairs (i.e., call sequence between two layer APIs) and 55.8% of layer parameters (e.g., "padding" in Conv2D). As a result, we find that many bugs arising from specific layer pairs and parameters can be missed by existing techniques.
  In view of the limitations of existing DL library testing techniques, we propose MEMO to efficiently generate diverse DL models by exploring layer types, layer pairs, and layer parameters. MEMO: (1) designs an initial model reduction technique to boost test efficiency without compromising model diversity; and (2) designs a set of mutation operators for a customized Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to explore new layer types, layer pairs, and layer parameters. We evaluate MEMO on seven popular DL libraries, including four for model execution (TensorFlow, PyTorch and MXNet, and ONNX) and three for model conversions (Keras-MXNet, TF2ONNX, ONNX2PyTorch). The evaluation result shows that MEMO outperforms recent works by covering 10.3% more layer pairs, 15.3% more layer parameters, and 2.3% library branches. Moreover, MEMO detects 29 new bugs in the latest version of DL libraries, with 17 of them confirmed by DL library developers, and 5 of those confirmed bugs have been fixed.

**Abstract:** This paper seeks to answer the following question: "What can we learn by predicting accuracy?" Indeed, classification is one of the most popular task in machine learning and many loss functions have been developed to maximize this non-differentiable objective. Unlike past work on loss function design, which was mostly guided by intuition and theory before being validated by experimentation, here we propose to approach this problem in the opposite way : we seek to extract knowledge from experiments. This data-driven approach is similar to that used in physics to discover general laws from data. We used a symbolic regression method to automatically find a mathematical expression that is highly correlated with the accuracy of a linear classifier. The formula discovered on more than 260 datasets has a Pearson correlation of 0.96 and a r2 of 0.93. More interestingly, this formula is highly explainable and confirms insights from various previous papers on loss design. We hope this work will open new perspectives in the search for new heuristics leading to a deeper understanding of machine learning theory.

**Abstract:** Internal cluster validity measures (such as the Calinski-Harabasz, Dunn, or Davies-Bouldin indices) are frequently used for selecting the appropriate number of partitions a dataset should be split into. In this paper we consider what happens if we treat such indices as objective functions in unsupervised learning activities. Is the optimal grouping with regards to, say, the Silhouette index really meaningful? It turns out that many cluster (in)validity indices promote clusterings that match expert knowledge quite poorly. We also introduce a new, well-performing variant of the Dunn index that is built upon OWA operators and the near-neighbour graph so that subspaces of higher density, regardless of their shapes, can be separated from each other better.

**Abstract:** Motivated by the ever-increasing concerns on personal data privacy and the rapidly growing data volume at local clients, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new machine learning setting. An FL system is comprised of a central parameter server and multiple local clients. It keeps data at local clients and learns a centralized model by sharing the model parameters learned locally. No local data needs to be shared, and privacy can be well protected. Nevertheless, since it is the model instead of the raw data that is shared, the system can be exposed to the poisoning model attacks launched by malicious clients. Furthermore, it is challenging to identify malicious clients since no local client data is available on the server. Besides, membership inference attacks can still be performed by using the uploaded model to estimate the client's local data, leading to privacy disclosure. In this work, we first propose a model update based federated averaging algorithm to defend against Byzantine attacks such as additive noise attacks and sign-flipping attacks. The individual client model initialization method is presented to provide further privacy protections from the membership inference attacks by hiding the individual local machine learning model. When combining these two schemes, privacy and security can be both effectively enhanced. The proposed schemes are proved to converge experimentally under non-IID data distribution when there are no attacks. Under Byzantine attacks, the proposed schemes perform much better than the classical model based FedAvg algorithm.

**Abstract:** During applying data-oriented diagnosis systems to distinguishing the type of and evaluating the severity of nuclear power plant initial events, it is of vital importance to decide which parameters to be used as the system input. However, although several diagnosis systems have already achieved acceptable performance in diagnosis precision and speed, hardly have the researchers discussed the method of monitoring point choosing and its layout. For this reason, redundant measuring data are used to train the diagnostic model, leading to high uncertainty of the classification, extra training time consumption, and higher probability of overfitting while training. In this study, a method of choosing thermal hydraulics parameters of a nuclear power plant is proposed, using the theory of post-hoc interpretability theory in deep learning. At the start, a novel Time-sequential Residual Convolutional Neural Network (TRES-CNN) diagnosis model is introduced to identify the position and hydrodynamic diameter of breaks in LOCA, using 38 parameters manually chosen on HPR1000 empirically. Afterwards, post-hoc interpretability methods are applied to evaluate the attributions of diagnosis model's outputs, deciding which 15 parameters to be more decisive in diagnosing LOCA details. The results show that the TRES-CNN based diagnostic model successfully predicts the position and size of breaks in LOCA via selected 15 parameters of HPR1000, with 25% of time consumption while training the model compared the process using total 38 parameters. In addition, the relative diagnostic accuracy error is within 1.5 percent compared with the model using parameters chosen empirically, which can be regarded as the same amount of diagnostic reliability.

**Abstract:** Pure vision transformer architectures are highly effective for short video classification and action recognition tasks. However, due to the quadratic complexity of self attention and lack of inductive bias, transformers are resource intensive and suffer from data inefficiencies. Long form video understanding tasks amplify data and memory efficiency problems in transformers making current approaches unfeasible to implement on data or memory restricted domains. This paper introduces an efficient Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) which uses a two-stream transformer architecture to model dependencies between static image features and temporal contextual features. Our proposed approach can classify videos up to two minutes in length on a single GPU, is data efficient, and achieves SOTA performance on several long video understanding tasks.

**Abstract:** This work studies the classical spectral clustering algorithm which embeds the vertices of some graph $G=(V_G, E_G)$ into $\mathbb{R}^k$ using $k$ eigenvectors of some matrix of $G$, and applies $k$-means to partition $V_G$ into $k$ clusters. Our first result is a tighter analysis on the performance of spectral clustering, and explains why it works under some much weaker condition than the ones studied in the literature. For the second result, we show that, by applying fewer than $k$ eigenvectors to construct the embedding, spectral clustering is able to produce better output for many practical instances; this result is the first of its kind in spectral clustering. Besides its conceptual and theoretical significance, the practical impact of our work is demonstrated by the empirical analysis on both synthetic and real-world datasets, in which spectral clustering produces comparable or better results with fewer than $k$ eigenvectors.

**Abstract:** In many applications, multiple parties have private data regarding the same set of users but on disjoint sets of attributes, and a server wants to leverage the data to train a model. To enable model learning while protecting the privacy of the data subjects, we need vertical federated learning (VFL) techniques, where the data parties share only information for training the model, instead of the private data. However, it is challenging to ensure that the shared information maintains privacy while learning accurate models. To the best of our knowledge, the algorithm proposed in this paper is the first practical solution for differentially private vertical federated k-means clustering, where the server can obtain a set of global centers with a provable differential privacy guarantee. Our algorithm assumes an untrusted central server that aggregates differentially private local centers and membership encodings from local data parties. It builds a weighted grid as the synopsis of the global dataset based on the received information. Final centers are generated by running any k-means algorithm on the weighted grid. Our approach for grid weight estimation uses a novel, light-weight, and differentially private set intersection cardinality estimation algorithm based on the Flajolet-Martin sketch. To improve the estimation accuracy in the setting with more than two data parties, we further propose a refined version of the weights estimation algorithm and a parameter tuning strategy to reduce the final k-means utility to be close to that in the central private setting. We provide theoretical utility analysis and experimental evaluation results for the cluster centers computed by our algorithm and show that our approach performs better both theoretically and empirically than the two baselines based on existing techniques.

**Abstract:** Open material databases storing hundreds of thousands of material structures and their corresponding properties have become the cornerstone of modern computational materials science. Yet, the raw outputs of the simulations, such as the trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations and charge densities from density functional theory calculations, are generally not shared due to their huge size. In this work, we describe a cloud-based platform to facilitate the sharing of raw data and enable the fast post-processing in the cloud to extract new properties defined by the user. As an initial demonstration, our database currently includes 6286 molecular dynamics trajectories for amorphous polymer electrolytes and 5.7 terabytes of data. We create a public analysis library at https://github.com/TRI-AMDD/htp_md to extract multiple properties from the raw data, using both expert designed functions and machine learning models. The analysis is run automatically with computation in the cloud, and results then populate a database that can be accessed publicly. Our platform encourages users to contribute both new trajectory data and analysis functions via public interfaces. Newly analyzed properties will be incorporated into the database. Finally, we create a front-end user interface at https://www.htpmd.matr.io for browsing and visualization of our data. We envision the platform to be a new way of sharing raw data and new insights for the computational materials science community.

**Abstract:** Properties of interest for crystals and molecules, such as band gap, elasticity, and solubility, are generally related to each other: they are governed by the same underlying laws of physics. However, when state-of-the-art graph neural networks attempt to predict multiple properties simultaneously (the multi-task learning (MTL) setting), they frequently underperform a suite of single property predictors. This suggests graph networks may not be fully leveraging these underlying similarities. Here we investigate a potential explanation for this phenomenon: the curvature of each property's loss surface significantly varies, leading to inefficient learning. This difference in curvature can be assessed by looking at spectral properties of the Hessians of each property's loss function, which is done in a matrix-free manner via randomized numerical linear algebra. We evaluate our hypothesis on two benchmark datasets (Materials Project (MP) and QM8) and consider how these findings can inform the training of novel multi-task learning models.

**Abstract:** Rapid discovery of new reactions and molecules in recent years has been facilitated by the advancements in high throughput screening, accessibility to a much more complex chemical design space, and the development of accurate molecular modeling frameworks. A holistic study of the growing chemistry literature is, therefore, required that focuses on understanding the recent trends and extrapolating them into possible future trajectories. To this end, several network theory-based studies have been reported that use a directed graph representation of chemical reactions. Here, we perform a study based on representing chemical reactions as hypergraphs where the hyperedges represent chemical reactions and nodes represent the participating molecules. We use a standard reactions dataset to construct a hypernetwork and report its statistics such as degree distributions, average path length, assortativity or degree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or communities). We also compute each statistic for an equivalent directed graph representation of reactions to draw parallels and highlight differences between the two. To demonstrate the AI applicability of hypergraph reaction representation, we generate dense hypergraph embeddings and use them in the reaction classification problem. We conclude that the hypernetwork representation is flexible, preserves reaction context, and uncovers hidden insights that are otherwise not apparent in a traditional directed graph representation of chemical reactions.

**Abstract:** Task scheduling is a critical problem when one user offloads multiple different tasks to the edge server. When a user has multiple tasks to offload and only one task can be transmitted to server at a time, while server processes tasks according to the transmission order, the problem is NP-hard. However, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to quickly obtain the optimal solution, while approaches based on reinforcement learning face with the challenge of excessively large action space and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted RL-based task scheduling method in order to improve the performance and convergence of the RL. We use DT to simulate the results of different decisions made by the agent, so that one agent can try multiple actions at a time, or, similarly, multiple agents can interact with environment in parallel in DT. In this way, the exploration efficiency of RL can be significantly improved via DT, and thus RL can converges faster and local optimality is less likely to happen. Particularly, two algorithms are designed to made task scheduling decisions, i.e., DT-assisted asynchronous Q-learning (DTAQL) and DT-assisted exploring Q-learning (DTEQL). Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly improve the convergence speed of Q-learning by increasing the exploration efficiency.

**Abstract:** We address the consistency of a kernel ridge regression estimate of the conditional mean embedding (CME), which is an embedding of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ into a target reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_Y$. The CME allows us to take conditional expectations of target RKHS functions, and has been employed in nonparametric causal and Bayesian inference. We address the misspecified setting, where the target CME is in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting from an input interpolation space between $\mathcal{H}_X$ and $L_2$, to $\mathcal{H}_Y$. This space of operators is shown to be isomorphic to a newly defined vector-valued interpolation space. Using this isomorphism, we derive a novel and adaptive statistical learning rate for the empirical CME estimator under the misspecified setting. Our analysis reveals that our rates match the optimal $O(\log n / n)$ rates without assuming $\mathcal{H}_Y$ to be finite dimensional. We further establish a lower bound on the learning rate, which shows that the obtained upper bound is optimal.

**Abstract:** In this paper we explore capabilities of spiking neural networks in solving multi-task classification problems using the approach of single-tasking of multiple tasks. We designed and implemented a multi-task spiking neural network (MT-SNN) that can learn two or more classification tasks while performing one task at a time. The task to perform is selected by modulating the firing threshold of leaky integrate and fire neurons used in this work. The network is implemented using Intel's Lava platform for the Loihi2 neuromorphic chip. Tests are performed on dynamic multitask classification for NMNIST data. The results show that MT-SNN effectively learns multiple tasks by modifying its dynamics, namely, the spiking neurons' firing threshold.

**Abstract:** Navigating off-road with a fast autonomous vehicle depends on a robust perception system that differentiates traversable from non-traversable terrain. Typically, this depends on a semantic understanding which is based on supervised learning from images annotated by a human expert. This requires a significant investment in human time, assumes correct expert classification, and small details can lead to misclassification. To address these challenges, we propose a method for predicting high- and low-risk terrains from only past vehicle experience in a self-supervised fashion. First, we develop a tool that projects the vehicle trajectory into the front camera image. Second, occlusions in the 3D representation of the terrain are filtered out. Third, an autoencoder trained on masked vehicle trajectory regions identifies low- and high-risk terrains based on the reconstruction error. We evaluated our approach with two models and different bottleneck sizes with two different training and testing sites with a fourwheeled off-road vehicle. Comparison with two independent test sets of semantic labels from similar terrain as training sites demonstrates the ability to separate the ground as low-risk and the vegetation as high-risk with 81.1% and 85.1% accuracy.

**Abstract:** The texture is defined as spatial structure of the intensities of the pixels in an image that is repeated periodically in the whole image or regions, and makes the concept of the image. Texture, color and shape are three main components which are used by human visual system to recognize image contents. In this paper, first of all, efficient and updated texture analysis operators are survived with details. Next, some state-of-the-art methods are survived that use texture analysis in medical applications and disease diagnosis. Finally, different approaches are compared in terms of accuracy, dataset, application, etc. Results demonstrate that texture features separately or in joint of different feature sets such as deep, color or shape features provide high accuracy in medical image classification.

**Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) continues to permeate all layers of academia, industry and society. Despite its successes, mental frameworks to capture and represent machine learning workflows in a consistent and coherent manner are lacking. For instance, the de facto process modeling standard, Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), managed by the Object Management Group, is widely accepted and applied. However, it is short of specific support to represent machine learning workflows. Further, the number of heterogeneous tools for deployment of machine learning solutions can easily overwhelm practitioners. Research is needed to align the process from modeling to deploying ML workflows.
  We analyze requirements for standard based conceptual modeling for machine learning workflows and their serverless deployment. Confronting the shortcomings with respect to consistent and coherent modeling of ML workflows in a technology independent and interoperable manner, we extend BPMN's Meta-Object Facility (MOF) metamodel and the corresponding notation and introduce BPMN4sML (BPMN for serverless machine learning). Our extension BPMN4sML follows the same outline referenced by the Object Management Group (OMG) for BPMN. We further address the heterogeneity in deployment by proposing a conceptual mapping to convert BPMN4sML models to corresponding deployment models using TOSCA.
  BPMN4sML allows technology-independent and interoperable modeling of machine learning workflows of various granularity and complexity across the entire machine learning lifecycle. It aids in arriving at a shared and standardized language to communicate ML solutions. Moreover, it takes the first steps toward enabling conversion of ML workflow model diagrams to corresponding deployment models for serverless deployment via TOSCA.

**Abstract:** On-demand service provisioning is a critical yet challenging issue in 6G wireless communication networks, since emerging services have significantly diverse requirements and the network resources become increasingly heterogeneous and dynamic. In this paper, we study the on-demand wireless resource orchestration problem with the focus on the computing delay in orchestration decision-making process. Specifically, we take the decision-making delay into the optimization problem. Then, a dynamic neural network (DyNN)-based method is proposed, where the model complexity can be adjusted according to the service requirements. We further build a knowledge base representing the relationship among the service requirements, available computing resources, and the resource allocation performance. By exploiting the knowledge, the width of DyNN can be selected in a timely manner, further improving the performance of orchestration. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the traditional static neural network, and also shows sufficient flexibility in on-demand service provisioning.

**Abstract:** Implicit feedback is frequently used for developing personalized recommendation services due to its ubiquity and accessibility in real-world systems. In order to effectively utilize such information, most research adopts the pairwise ranking method on constructed training triplets (user, positive item, negative item) and aims to distinguish between positive items and negative items for each user. However, most of these methods treat all the training triplets equally, which ignores the subtle difference between different positive or negative items. On the other hand, even though some other works make use of the auxiliary information (e.g., dwell time) of user behaviors to capture this subtle difference, such auxiliary information is hard to obtain. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel training framework named Triplet Importance Learning (TIL), which adaptively learns the importance score of training triplets. We devise two strategies for the importance score generation and formulate the whole procedure as a bilevel optimization, which does not require any rule-based design. We integrate the proposed training procedure with several Matrix Factorization (MF)- and Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based recommendation models, demonstrating the compatibility of our framework. Via a comparison using three real-world datasets with many state-of-the-art methods, we show that our proposed method outperforms the best existing models by 3-21\% in terms of Recall@k for the top-k recommendation.

**Abstract:** The ability to form non-line-of-sight (NLOS) images of changing scenes could be transformative in a variety of fields, including search and rescue, autonomous vehicle navigation, and reconnaissance. Most existing active NLOS methods illuminate the hidden scene using a pulsed laser directed at a relay surface and collect time-resolved measurements of returning light. The prevailing approaches include raster scanning of a rectangular grid on a vertical wall opposite the volume of interest to generate a collection of confocal measurements. These are inherently limited by the need for laser scanning. Methods that avoid laser scanning track the moving parts of the hidden scene as one or two point targets. In this work, based on more complete optical response modeling yet still without multiple illumination positions, we demonstrate accurate reconstructions of objects in motion and a 'map' of the stationary scenery behind them. The ability to count, localize, and characterize the sizes of hidden objects in motion, combined with mapping of the stationary hidden scene, could greatly improve indoor situational awareness in a variety of applications.

**Abstract:** The necessity for cooperation among intelligent machines has popularised cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. However, many research endeavors have been focused on developing practical MARL algorithms whose effectiveness has been studied only empirically, thereby lacking theoretical guarantees. As recent studies have revealed, MARL methods often achieve performance that is unstable in terms of reward monotonicity or suboptimal at convergence. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework named Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML) that provides a general template for MARL algorithmic designs. We prove that algorithms derived from the HAML template satisfy the desired properties of the monotonic improvement of the joint reward and the convergence to Nash equilibrium. We verify the practicality of HAML by proving that the current state-of-the-art cooperative MARL algorithms, HATRPO and HAPPO, are in fact HAML instances. Next, as a natural outcome of our theory, we propose HAML extensions of two well-known RL algorithms, HAA2C (for A2C) and HADDPG (for DDPG), and demonstrate their effectiveness against strong baselines on StarCraftII and Multi-Agent MuJoCo tasks.

**Abstract:** Accurate and robust abdominal multi-organ segmentation from CT imaging of different modalities is a challenging task due to complex inter- and intra-organ shape and appearance variations among abdominal organs. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic multi-organ segmentation network with hierarchical spatial-wise feature modulation to capture flexible organ semantic variants and inject the learnt variants into different scales of feature maps for guiding segmentation. More specifically, we design an input decomposition module via a conditional variational auto-encoder to learn organ-specific distributions on the low dimensional latent space and model richer organ semantic variations that is conditioned on input images.Then by integrating these learned variations into the V-Net decoder hierarchically via spatial feature transformation, which has the ability to convert the variations into conditional Affine transformation parameters for spatial-wise feature maps modulating and guiding the fine-scale segmentation. The proposed method is trained on the publicly available AbdomenCT-1K dataset and evaluated on two other open datasets, i.e., 100 challenging/pathological testing patient cases from AbdomenCT-1K fully-supervised abdominal organ segmentation benchmark and 90 cases from TCIA+&BTCV dataset. Highly competitive or superior quantitative segmentation results have been achieved using these datasets for four abdominal organs of liver, kidney, spleen and pancreas with reported Dice scores improved by 7.3% for kidneys and 9.7% for pancreas, while being ~7 times faster than two strong baseline segmentation methods(nnUNet and CoTr).

**Abstract:** Accurate tooth volume segmentation is a prerequisite for computer-aided dental analysis. Deep learning-based tooth segmentation methods have achieved satisfying performances but require a large quantity of tooth data with ground truth. The dental data publicly available is limited meaning the existing methods can not be reproduced, evaluated and applied in clinical practice. In this paper, we establish a 3D dental CBCT dataset CTooth+, with 22 fully annotated volumes and 146 unlabeled volumes. We further evaluate several state-of-the-art tooth volume segmentation strategies based on fully-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and active learning, and define the performance principles. This work provides a new benchmark for the tooth volume segmentation task, and the experiment can serve as the baseline for future AI-based dental imaging research and clinical application development.

**Abstract:** Recommending points of interest is a difficult problem that requires precise location information to be extracted from a location-based social media platform. Another challenging and critical problem for such a location-aware recommendation system is modelling users' preferences based on their historical behaviors. We propose a location-aware recommender system based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for the purpose of providing users with location-based recommendations. The proposed model incorporates location data and user preferences. When compared to predicting the next item of interest (location) at each position in a sequence, our model can provide the user with more relevant results. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art sequential models.
