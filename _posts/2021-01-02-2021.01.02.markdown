**Abstract:** Recent work on training neural retrievers for open-domain question answering (OpenQA) has employed both supervised and unsupervised approaches. However, it remains unclear how unsupervised and supervised methods can be used most effectively for neural retrievers. In this work, we systematically study retriever pre-training. We first propose an approach of unsupervised pre-training with the Inverse Cloze Task and masked salient spans, followed by supervised finetuning using question-context pairs. This approach leads to absolute gains of 2+ points over the previous best result in the top-20 retrieval accuracy on Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets.
  We also explore two approaches for end-to-end supervised training of the reader and retriever components in OpenQA models. In the first approach, the reader considers each retrieved document separately while in the second approach, the reader considers all the retrieved documents together. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches as we obtain new state-of-the-art results. On the Natural Questions dataset, we obtain a top-20 retrieval accuracy of 84, an improvement of 5 points over the recent DPR model. In addition, we achieve good results on answer extraction, outperforming recent models like REALM and RAG by 3+ points. We further scale up end-to-end training to large models and show consistent gains in performance over smaller models.

**Abstract:** Pre-trained text-to-text transformers such as BART have achieved impressive performance across a range of NLP tasks. Recent study further shows that they can learn to generalize to novel tasks, by including task descriptions as part of the source sequence and training the model with (source, target) examples. At test time, these fine-tuned models can make inferences on new tasks using the new task descriptions as part of the input. However, this approach has potential limitations, as the model learns to solve individual (source, target) examples (i.e., at the instance level), instead of learning to solve tasks by taking all examples within a task as a whole (i.e., at the task level). To this end, we introduce Hypter, a framework that improves text-to-text transformer's generalization ability to unseen tasks by training a hypernetwork to generate task-specific, light-weight adapters from task descriptions. Experiments on ZEST dataset and a synthetic SQuAD dataset demonstrate that Hypter improves upon fine-tuning baselines. Notably, when using BART-Large as the main network, Hypter brings 11.3% comparative improvement on ZEST dataset.

**Abstract:** For robots to navigate and interact more richly with the world around them, they will likely require a deeper understanding of the world in which they operate. In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world "mean" to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys were published. This survey therefore provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity, in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics, including mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The survey also covers key practical considerations, including enablers like increased data availability and improved computational hardware, and major application areas where...

**Abstract:** The novel of coronavirus (COVID-19) has suddenly and abruptly changed the world as we knew at the start of the 3rd decade of the 21st century. Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement prediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures. Referred to as the COVID-19 adopted Hybrid and Parallel deep fusion framework for Stock price Movement Prediction (COVID19-HPSMP), innovative fusion strategies are used to combine scattered social media news related to COVID-19 with historical mark data. The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion centre that combines localized features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19 PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.

**Abstract:** Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper, we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning. We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions for future research.

**Abstract:** Broader disclosive transparency$-$truth and clarity in communication regarding the function of AI systems$-$is widely considered desirable. Unfortunately, it is a nebulous concept, difficult to both define and quantify. This is problematic, as previous work has demonstrated possible trade-offs and negative consequences to disclosive transparency, such as a confusion effect, where "too much information" clouds a reader's understanding of what a system description means. Disclosive transparency's subjective nature has rendered deep study into these problems and their remedies difficult. To improve this state of affairs, We introduce neural language model-based probabilistic metrics to directly model disclosive transparency, and demonstrate that they correlate with user and expert opinions of system transparency, making them a valid objective proxy. Finally, we demonstrate the use of these metrics in a pilot study quantifying the relationships between transparency, confusion, and user perceptions in a corpus of real NLP system descriptions.

**Abstract:** After affecting the world in unexpected ways, COVID-19 has started mutating which is evident with the insurgence of its new variants. The governments, hospitals, schools, industries, and humans, in general, are looking for a potential solution in the vaccine which will eventually be available but its timeline for eradicating the virus is yet unknown. Several researchers have encouraged and recommended the use of good practices such as physical healthcare monitoring, immunity-boosting, personal hygiene, mental healthcare, and contact tracing for slowing down the spread of the virus. In this article, we propose the use of wearable/mobile sensors integrated with the Internet of Everything to cover the spectrum of good practices in an automated manner. We present hypothetical frameworks for each of the good practice modules and propose the COvid-19 Resistance Framework using the Internet of Everything (CORFIE) to tie all the individual modules in a unified architecture. We envision that CORFIE would be influential in assisting people with the new normal for current and future pandemics as well as instrumental in halting the economic losses, respectively. We also provide potential challenges and their probable solutions in compliance with the proposed CORFIE.

<p>

**Abstract:** Networks are a widely-used tool to investigate the large-scale connectivity structure in complex systems and graphons have been proposed as an infinite size limit of dense networks. The detection of communities or other meso-scale structures is a prominent topic in network science as it allows the identification of functional building blocks in complex systems. When such building blocks may be present in graphons is an open question. In this paper, we define a graphon-modularity and demonstrate that it can be maximised to detect communities in graphons. We then investigate specific synthetic graphons and show that they may show a wide range of different community structures. We also reformulate the graphon-modularity maximisation as a continuous optimisation problem and so prove the optimal community structure or lack thereof for some graphons, something that is usually not possible for networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimating a graphon from network data as an intermediate step can improve the detection of communities, in comparison with exclusively maximising the modularity of the network. While the choice of graphon-estimator may strongly influence the accord between the community structure of a network and its estimated graphon, we find that there is a substantial overlap if an appropriate estimator is used. Our study demonstrates that community detection for graphons is possible and may serve as a privacy-preserving way to cluster network data.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a detailed study of improving visual representations for vision language (VL) tasks and develops an improved object detection model to provide object-centric representations of images. Compared to the most widely used \emph{bottom-up and top-down} model \cite{anderson2018bottom}, the new model is bigger, better-designed for VL tasks, and pre-trained on much larger training corpora that combine multiple public annotated object detection datasets. Therefore, it can generate representations of a richer collection of visual objects and concepts. While previous VL research focuses mainly on improving the vision-language fusion model and leaves the object detection model improvement untouched, we show that visual features matter significantly in VL models. In our experiments we feed the visual features generated by the new object detection model into a Transformer-based VL fusion model \oscar \cite{li2020oscar}, and utilize an improved approach \short\ to pre-train the VL model and fine-tune it on a wide range of downstream VL tasks. Our results show that the new visual features significantly improve the performance across all VL tasks, creating new state-of-the-art results on seven public benchmarks. We will release the new object detection model to public.

**Abstract:** Recently, it has attracted much attention to build reliable named entity recognition (NER) systems using limited annotated data. Nearly all existing works heavily rely on domain-specific resources, such as external lexicons and knowledge bases. However, such domain-specific resources are often not available, meanwhile it's difficult and expensive to construct the resources, which has become a key obstacle to wider adoption. To tackle the problem, in this work, we propose a novel robust and domain-adaptive approach RDANER for low-resource NER, which only uses cheap and easily obtainable resources. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance when only using cheap and easily obtainable resources, and delivers competitive results against state-of-the-art methods which use difficultly obtainable domainspecific resources. All our code and corpora can be found on https://github.com/houking-can/RDANER.

**Abstract:** Rating systems play an important role in competitive sports and games. They provide a measure of player skill, which incentivizes competitive performances and enables balanced match-ups. In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian rating system for contests with many participants. It is widely applicable to competition formats with discrete ranked matches, such as online programming competitions, obstacle courses races, and some video games. The simplicity of our system allows us to prove theoretical bounds on robustness and runtime. In addition, we show that the system aligns incentives: that is, a player who seeks to maximize their rating will never want to underperform. Experimentally, the rating system rivals or surpasses existing systems in prediction accuracy, and computes faster than existing systems by up to an order of magnitude.

**Abstract:** Question: I have five fingers but I am not alive. What am I? Answer: a glove. Answering such a riddle-style question is a challenging cognitive process, in that it requires complex commonsense reasoning abilities, an understanding of figurative language, and counterfactual reasoning skills, which are all important abilities for advanced natural language understanding (NLU). However, there are currently no dedicated datasets aiming to test these abilities. Herein, we present RiddleSense, a new multiple-choice question answering task, which comes with the first large dataset (5.7k examples) for answering riddle-style commonsense questions. We systematically evaluate a wide range of models over the challenge, and point out that there is a large gap between the best-supervised model and human performance -- suggesting intriguing future research in the direction of higher-order commonsense reasoning and linguistic creativity towards building advanced NLU systems.

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to significant improvements in tasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting, where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art medical image semantic segmentation approaches on two medical image semantic segmentation datasets.

**Abstract:** Humanoid robots that act as human-robot interfaces equipped with social skills can assist people in many of their daily activities. Receptionist robots are one such application where social skills and appearance are of utmost importance. Many existing robot receptionist systems suffer from high cost and they do not disclose internal architectures for further development for robot researchers. Moreover, there does not exist customizable open-source robot receptionist frameworks to be deployed for any given application. In this paper we present an open-source robot receptionist intelligence core -- "DEVI"(means 'lady' in Sinhala), that provides researchers with ease of creating customized robot receptionists according to the requirements (cost, external appearance, and required processing power). Moreover, this paper also presents details on a prototype implementation of a physical robot using the DEVI system. The robot can give directional guidance with physical gestures, answer basic queries using a speech recognition and synthesis system, recognize and greet known people using face recognition and register new people in its database, using a self-learning neural network. Experiments conducted with DEVI show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

**Abstract:** Continual learning usually assumes the incoming data are fully labeled, which might not be applicable in real applications. In this work, we consider semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) that incrementally learns from partially labeled data. Observing that existing continual learning methods lack the ability to continually exploit the unlabeled data, we propose deep Online Replay with Discriminator Consistency (ORDisCo) to interdependently learn a classifier with a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), which continually passes the learned data distribution to the classifier. In particular, ORDisCo replays data sampled from the conditional generator to the classifier in an online manner, exploiting unlabeled data in a time- and storage-efficient way. Further, to explicitly overcome the catastrophic forgetting of unlabeled data, we selectively stabilize parameters of the discriminator that are important for discriminating the pairs of old unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels predicted by the classifier. We extensively evaluate ORDisCo on various semi-supervised learning benchmark datasets for SSCL, and show that ORDisCo achieves significant performance improvement on SVHN, CIFAR10 and Tiny-ImageNet, compared to strong baselines.

**Abstract:** In recent times, BERT based transformer models have become an inseparable part of the 'tech stack' of text processing models. Similar progress is being observed in the speech domain with a multitude of models observing state-of-the-art results by using audio transformer models to encode speech. This begs the question of what are these audio transformer models learning. Moreover, although the standard methodology is to choose the last layer embedding for any downstream task, but is it the optimal choice? We try to answer these questions for the two recent audio transformer models, Mockingjay and wave2vec2.0. We compare them on a comprehensive set of language delivery and structure features including audio, fluency and pronunciation features. Additionally, we probe the audio models' understanding of textual surface, syntax, and semantic features and compare them to BERT. We do this over exhaustive settings for native, non-native, synthetic, read and spontaneous speech datasets

**Abstract:** Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging vision task due to the absence of ground-truth temporal locations of actions in the training videos. With only video-level supervision during training, most existing methods rely on a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework to predict the start and end frame of each action category in a video. However, the existing MIL-based approach has a major limitation of only capturing the most discriminative frames of an action, ignoring the full extent of an activity. Moreover, these methods cannot model background activity effectively, which plays an important role in localizing foreground activities. In this paper, we present a novel framework named HAM-Net with a hybrid attention mechanism which includes temporal soft, semi-soft and hard attentions to address these issues. Our temporal soft attention module, guided by an auxiliary background class in the classification module, models the background activity by introducing an "action-ness" score for each video snippet. Moreover, our temporal semi-soft and hard attention modules, calculating two attention scores for each video snippet, help to focus on the less discriminative frames of an action to capture the full action boundary. Our proposed approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by at least 2.2% mAP at IoU threshold 0.5 on the THUMOS14 dataset, and by at least 1.3% mAP at IoU threshold 0.75 on the ActivityNet1.2 dataset.

**Abstract:** Many state-of-art neural models designed for monotonicity reasoning perform poorly on downward inference. To address this shortcoming, we developed an attentive tree-structured neural network. It consists of a tree-based long-short-term-memory network (Tree-LSTM) with soft attention. It is designed to model the syntactic parse tree information from the sentence pair of a reasoning task. A self-attentive aggregator is used for aligning the representations of the premise and the hypothesis. We present our model and evaluate it using the Monotonicity Entailment Dataset (MED). We show and attempt to explain that our model outperforms existing models on MED.

**Abstract:** Predicting the final ischaemic stroke lesion provides crucial information regarding the volume of salvageable hypoperfused tissue, which helps physicians in the difficult decision-making process of treatment planning and intervention. Treatment selection is influenced by clinical diagnosis, which requires delineating the stroke lesion, as well as characterising cerebral blood flow dynamics using neuroimaging acquisitions. Nonetheless, predicting the final stroke lesion is an intricate task, due to the variability in lesion size, shape, location and the underlying cerebral haemodynamic processes that occur after the ischaemic stroke takes place. Moreover, since elapsed time between stroke and treatment is related to the loss of brain tissue, assessing and predicting the final stroke lesion needs to be performed in a short period of time, which makes the task even more complex. Therefore, there is a need for automatic methods that predict the final stroke lesion and support physicians in the treatment decision process. We propose a fully automatic deep learning method based on unsupervised and supervised learning to predict the final stroke lesion after 90 days. Our aim is to predict the final stroke lesion location and extent, taking into account the underlying cerebral blood flow dynamics that can influence the prediction. To achieve this, we propose a two-branch Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which provides specialized data-driven features from different sets of standard parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging maps. These data-driven feature maps are then combined with the parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging maps, and fed to a Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network architecture. We evaluated our proposal on the publicly available ISLES 2017 testing dataset, reaching a Dice score of 0.38, Hausdorff Distance of 29.21 mm, and Average Symmetric Surface Distance of 5.52 mm.

**Abstract:** Streaming social media provides a real-time glimpse of extreme weather impacts. However, the volume of streaming data makes mining information a challenge for emergency managers, policy makers, and disciplinary scientists. Here we explore the effectiveness of data learned approaches to mine and filter information from streaming social media data from Hurricane Irma's landfall in Florida, USA. We use 54,383 Twitter messages (out of 784K geolocated messages) from 16,598 users from Sept. 10 - 12, 2017 to develop 4 independent models to filter data for relevance: 1) a geospatial model based on forcing conditions at the place and time of each tweet, 2) an image classification model for tweets that include images, 3) a user model to predict the reliability of the tweeter, and 4) a text model to determine if the text is related to Hurricane Irma. All four models are independently tested, and can be combined to quickly filter and visualize tweets based on user-defined thresholds for each submodel. We envision that this type of filtering and visualization routine can be useful as a base model for data capture from noisy sources such as Twitter. The data can then be subsequently used by policy makers, environmental managers, emergency managers, and domain scientists interested in finding tweets with specific attributes to use during different stages of the disaster (e.g., preparedness, response, and recovery), or for detailed research.

**Abstract:** Achieving accurate and robust global situational awareness of a complex time-evolving field from a limited number of sensors has been a longstanding challenge. This reconstruction problem is especially difficult when sensors are sparsely positioned in a seemingly random or unorganized manner, which is often encountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems. Moreover, these sensors can be in motion and can become online or offline over time. The key leverage in addressing this scientific issue is the wealth of data accumulated from the sensors. As a solution to this problem, we propose a data-driven spatial field recovery technique founded on a structured grid-based deep-learning approach for arbitrary positioned sensors of any numbers. It should be noted that the naÃ¯ve use of machine learning becomes prohibitively expensive for global field reconstruction and is furthermore not adaptable to an arbitrary number of sensors. In the present work, we consider the use of Voronoi tessellation to obtain a structured-grid representation from sensor locations enabling the computationally tractable use of convolutional neural networks. One of the central features of the present method is its compatibility with deep-learning based super-resolution reconstruction techniques for structured sensor data that are established for image processing. The proposed reconstruction technique is demonstrated for unsteady wake flow, geophysical data, and three-dimensional turbulence. The current framework is able to handle an arbitrary number of moving sensors, and thereby overcomes a major limitation with existing reconstruction methods. The presented technique opens a new pathway towards the practical use of neural networks for real-time global field estimation.

**Abstract:** Many real-world applications, such as those in medical domains, recommendation systems, etc, can be formulated as large state space reinforcement learning problems with only a small budget of the number of policy changes, i.e., low switching cost. This paper focuses on the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) recently studied in [Yang et al 2019, Jin et al 2020] where the linear function approximation is used for generalization on the large state space. We present the first algorithm for linear MDP with a low switching cost. Our algorithm achieves an $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{d^3H^4K}\right)$ regret bound with a near-optimal $O\left(d H\log K\right)$ global switching cost where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the planning horizon and $K$ is the number of episodes the agent plays. Our regret bound matches the best existing polynomial algorithm by [Jin et al 2020] and our switching cost is exponentially smaller than theirs. When specialized to tabular MDP, our switching cost bound improves those in [Bai et al 2019, Zhang et al 20020]. We complement our positive result with an $Î©\left(dH/\log d\right)$ global switching cost lower bound for any no-regret algorithm.

**Abstract:** Normalization of polynomials plays an essential role in the approximate basis computation of vanishing ideals. In computer algebra, coefficient normalization, which normalizes a polynomial by its coefficient norm, is the most common method. In this study, we propose gradient-weighted normalization for the approximate border basis computation of vanishing ideals, inspired by the recent results in machine learning. The data-dependent nature of gradient-weighted normalization leads to powerful properties such as better stability against perturbation and consistency in the scaling of input points, which cannot be attained by the conventional coefficient normalization. With a slight modification, the analysis of algorithms with coefficient normalization still works with gradient-weighted normalization and the time complexity does not change. We also provide an upper bound on the coefficient norm based on the gradient-weighted norm, which allows us to discuss the approximate border bases with gradient-weighted normalization from the perspective of the coefficient norm.

**Abstract:** We proposed a novel multilayer correlated topic model (MCTM) to analyze how the main ideas inherit and vary between a document and its different segments, which helps understand an article's structure. The variational expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was derived to estimate the posterior and parameters in MCTM. We introduced two potential applications of MCTM, including the paragraph-level document analysis and market basket data analysis. The effectiveness of MCTM in understanding the document structure has been verified by the great predictive performance on held-out documents and intuitive visualization. We also showed that MCTM could successfully capture customers' popular shopping patterns in the market basket analysis.

**Abstract:** The early and robust detection of anomalies occurring in discrete manufacturing processes allows operators to prevent harm, e.g. defects in production machinery or products. While current approaches for data-driven anomaly detection provide good results on the exact processes they were trained on, they often lack the ability to flexibly adapt to changes, e.g. in products. Continual learning promises such flexibility, allowing for an automatic adaption of previously learnt knowledge to new tasks. Therefore, this article discusses different continual learning approaches from the group of regularization strategies, which are implemented, evaluated and compared based on a real industrial metal forming dataset.

**Abstract:** We present a neural modeling framework for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging. Previous solutions have sought to explicitly recover the 3D geometry (e.g., as point clouds) or voxel density (e.g., within a pre-defined volume) of the hidden scene. In contrast, inspired by the recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach, we use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent the neural transient field or NeTF. However, NeTF measures the transient over spherical wavefronts rather than the radiance along lines. We therefore formulate a spherical volume NeTF reconstruction pipeline, applicable to both confocal and non-confocal setups. Compared with NeRF, NeTF samples a much sparser set of viewpoints (scanning spots) and the sampling is highly uneven. We thus introduce a Monte Carlo technique to improve the robustness in the reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NeTF provides higher quality reconstruction and preserves fine details largely missing in the state-of-the-art.

**Abstract:** To perform temporal and sequential machine learning tasks, the use of conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) has been dwindling due to the training complexities of RNNs. To this end, accelerators for delayed feedback reservoir computing (DFRC) have attracted attention in lieu of RNNs, due to their simple hardware implementations. A typical implementation of a DFRC accelerator consists of a delay loop and a single nonlinear neuron, together acting as multiple virtual nodes for computing. In prior work, photonic DFRC accelerators have shown an undisputed advantage of fast computation over their electronic counterparts. In this paper, we propose a more energy-efficient chip-scale DFRC accelerator that employs a silicon photonic microring (MR) based nonlinear neuron along with on-chip photonic waveguides-based delayed feedback loop. Our evaluations show that, compared to a well-known photonic DFRC accelerator from prior work, our proposed MR-based DFRC accelerator achieves 35% and 98.7% lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), respectively, for the prediction tasks of NARMA10 and Santa Fe time series. In addition, our MR-based DFRC accelerator achieves 58.8% lower symbol error rate (SER) for the Non-Linear Channel Equalization task. Moreover, our MR-based DFRC accelerator has 98% and 93% faster training time, respectively, compared to an electronic and a photonic DFRC accelerators from prior work.

**Abstract:** Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are used by adversaries to establish Command and Control (C\&C) server communications during cyber attacks. Blacklists of known/identified C\&C domains are often used as one of the defense mechanisms. However, since blacklists are static and generated by signature-based approaches, they can neither keep up nor detect never-seen-before malicious domain names. Due to this shortcoming of blacklist domain checking, machine learning algorithms have been used to address the problem to some extent. However, when training is performed with limited datasets, the algorithms are likely to fail in detecting new DGA variants. To mitigate this weakness, we successfully applied a DGA-based malicious domain classifier using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method with a novel feature engineering technique. Our model's performance shows a higher level of accuracy compared to a previously reported model from prior research. Additionally, we propose a new method using adversarial machine learning to generate never-before-seen malware-related domain families that can be used to illustrate the shortcomings of machine learning algorithms in this regard. Next, we augment the training dataset with new samples such that it makes training of the machine learning models more effective in detecting never-before-seen malicious domain name variants. Finally, to protect blacklists of malicious domain names from disclosure and tampering, we devise secure data containers that store blacklists and guarantee their protection against adversarial access and modifications.

**Abstract:** Gliomas are among the most aggressive and deadly brain tumors. This paper details the proposed Deep Neural Network architecture for brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Images. The architecture consists of a cascade of three Deep Layer Aggregation neural networks, where each stage elaborates the response using the feature maps and the probabilities of the previous stage, and the MRI channels as inputs. The neuroimaging data are part of the publicly available Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 challenge dataset, where we evaluated our proposal in the BraTS 2020 Validation and Test sets. In the Test set, the experimental results achieved a Dice score of 0.8858, 0.8297 and 0.7900, with an Hausdorff Distance of 5.32 mm, 22.32 mm and 20.44 mm for the whole tumor, core tumor and enhanced tumor, respectively.

**Abstract:** Nuclei instance segmentation plays an important role in the analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images. While supervised deep learning (DL)-based approaches represent the state-of-the-art in automatic nuclei instance segmentation, annotated datasets are required to train these models. There are two main types of tissue processing protocols, namely formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples (FS). Although FFPE-derived H&E stained tissue sections are the most widely used samples, H&E staining on frozen sections derived from FS samples is a relevant method in intra-operative surgical sessions as it can be performed fast. Due to differences in the protocols of these two types of samples, the derived images and in particular the nuclei appearance may be different in the acquired whole slide images. Analysis of FS-derived H&E stained images can be more challenging as rapid preparation, staining, and scanning of FS sections may lead to deterioration in image quality.
  In this paper, we introduce CryoNuSeg, the first fully annotated FS-derived cryosectioned and H&E-stained nuclei instance segmentation dataset. The dataset contains images from 10 human organs that were not exploited in other publicly available datasets, and is provided with three manual mark-ups to allow measuring intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Moreover, we investigate the effects of tissue fixation/embedding protocol (i.e., FS or FFPE) on the automatic nuclei instance segmentation performance of one of the state-of-the-art DL approaches. We also create a baseline segmentation benchmark for the dataset that can be used in future research.
  A step-by-step guide to generate the dataset as well as the full dataset and other detailed information are made available to fellow researchers at https://github.com/masih4/CryoNuSeg.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel formulation of the "effectiveness problem" in communications, put forth by Shannon and Weaver in their seminal work [2], by considering multiple agents communicating over a noisy channel in order to achieve better coordination and cooperation in a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition to interacting with the environment can also communicate with each other over a noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment and the message each agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate "effectively" over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message reliably over a noisy channel, and the "learning to communicate" framework that has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP. This is a very powerful framework, which has many real world applications, from autonomous vehicle planning to drone swarm control, and opens up the rich toolbox of deep reinforcement learning for the design of multi-user communication systems.

**Abstract:** High fidelity segmentation of both macro and microvascular structure of the retina plays a pivotal role in determining degenerative retinal diseases, yet it is a difficult problem. Due to successive resolution loss in the encoding phase combined with the inability to recover this lost information in the decoding phase, autoencoding based segmentation approaches are limited in their ability to extract retinal microvascular structure. We propose RV-GAN, a new multi-scale generative architecture for accurate retinal vessel segmentation to alleviate this. The proposed architecture uses two generators and two multi-scale autoencoding discriminators for better microvessel localization and segmentation. In order to avoid the loss of fidelity suffered by traditional GAN-based segmentation systems, we introduce a novel weighted feature matching loss. This new loss incorporates and prioritizes features from the discriminator's decoder over the encoder. Doing so combined with the fact that the discriminator's decoder attempts to determine real or fake images at the pixel level better preserves macro and microvascular structure. By combining reconstruction and weighted feature matching loss, the proposed architecture achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9887, 0.9914, and 0.9887 in pixel-wise segmentation of retinal vasculature from three publicly available datasets, namely DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, and STARE, respectively. Additionally, RV-GAN outperforms other architectures in two additional relevant metrics, mean intersection-over-union (Mean-IOU) and structural similarity measure (SSIM).

**Abstract:** Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key technology to enable massive machine type communications (mMTC) in 5G networks and beyond. In this paper, NOMA is applied to improve the random access efficiency in high-density spatially-distributed multi-cell wireless IoT networks, where IoT devices contend for accessing the shared wireless channel using an adaptive p-persistent slotted Aloha protocol. To enable a capacity-optimal network, a novel formulation of random channel access management is proposed, in which the transmission probability of each IoT device is tuned to maximize the geometric mean of users' expected capacity. It is shown that the network optimization objective is high dimensional and mathematically intractable, yet it admits favourable mathematical properties that enable the design of efficient data-driven algorithmic solutions which do not require a priori knowledge of the channel model or network topology. A centralized model-based algorithm and a scalable distributed model-free algorithm, are proposed to optimally tune the transmission probabilities of IoT devices and attain the maximum capacity. The convergence of the proposed algorithms to the optimal solution is further established based on convex optimization and game-theoretic analysis. Extensive simulations demonstrate the merits of the novel formulation and the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.
