**Abstract:** Music performance synthesis aims to synthesize a musical score into a natural performance. In this paper, we borrow recent advances in text-to-speech synthesis and present the Deep Performer -- a novel system for score-to-audio music performance synthesis. Unlike speech, music often contains polyphony and long notes. Hence, we propose two new techniques for handling polyphonic inputs and providing a fine-grained conditioning in a transformer encoder-decoder model. To train our proposed system, we present a new violin dataset consisting of paired recordings and scores along with estimated alignments between them. We show that our proposed model can synthesize music with clear polyphony and harmonic structures. In a listening test, we achieve competitive quality against the baseline model, a conditional generative audio model, in terms of pitch accuracy, timbre and noise level. Moreover, our proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline on an existing piano dataset in overall quality.

**Abstract:** The manipulation of latent space has recently become an interesting topic in the field of generative models. Recent research shows that latent directions can be used to manipulate images towards certain attributes. However, controlling the generation process of 3D generative models remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D manipulation method that can manipulate both the shape and texture of the model using text or image-based prompts such as 'a young face' or 'a surprised face'. We leverage the power of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model and a pre-trained 3D GAN model designed to generate face avatars, and create a fully differentiable rendering pipeline to manipulate meshes. More specifically, our method takes an input latent code and modifies it such that the target attribute specified by a text or image prompt is present or enhanced, while leaving other attributes largely unaffected. Our method requires only 5 minutes per manipulation, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive results and comparisons.

**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning establishes a new paradigm of learning representations with much fewer or even no label annotations. Recently there has been remarkable progress on large-scale contrastive learning models which require substantial computing resources, yet such models are not practically optimal for small-scale tasks. To fill the gap, we aim to study contrastive learning on the wearable-based activity recognition task. Specifically, we conduct an in-depth study of contrastive learning from both algorithmic-level and task-level perspectives. For algorithmic-level analysis, we decompose contrastive models into several key components and conduct rigorous experimental evaluations to better understand the efficacy and rationale behind contrastive learning. More importantly, for task-level analysis, we show that the wearable-based signals bring unique challenges and opportunities to existing contrastive models, which cannot be readily solved by existing algorithms. Our thorough empirical studies suggest important practices and shed light on future research challenges. In the meantime, this paper presents an open-source PyTorch library \texttt{CL-HAR}, which can serve as a practical tool for researchers. The library is highly modularized and easy to use, which opens up avenues for exploring novel contrastive models quickly in the future.

**Abstract:** Questions in causality, control, and reinforcement learning go beyond the classical machine learning task of prediction under i.i.d. observations. Instead, these fields consider the problem of learning how to actively perturb a system to achieve a certain effect on a response variable. Arguably, they have complementary views on the problem: In control, one usually aims to first identify the system by excitation strategies to then apply model-based design techniques to control the system. In (non-model-based) reinforcement learning, one directly optimizes a reward. In causality, one focus is on identifiability of causal structure. We believe that combining the different views might create synergies and this competition is meant as a first step toward such synergies. The participants had access to observational and (offline) interventional data generated by dynamical systems. Track CHEM considers an open-loop problem in which a single impulse at the beginning of the dynamics can be set, while Track ROBO considers a closed-loop problem in which control variables can be set at each time step. The goal in both tracks is to infer controls that drive the system to a desired state. Code is open-sourced ( https://github.com/LearningByDoingCompetition/learningbydoing-comp ) to reproduce the winning solutions of the competition and to facilitate trying out new methods on the competition tasks.

**Abstract:** Despite impressive capabilities and outstanding performance, deep neural network(DNN) has captured increasing public concern for its security problem, due to frequent occurrence of erroneous behaviors. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct systematically testing before its deployment to real-world applications. Existing testing methods have provided fine-grained criteria based on neuron coverage and reached high exploratory degree of testing. But there is still a gap between the neuron coverage and model's robustness evaluation. To bridge the gap, we observed that neurons which change the activation value dramatically due to minor perturbation are prone to trigger incorrect corner cases. Motivated by it, we propose neuron sensitivity and develop a novel white-box testing framework for DNN, donated as DeepSensor. The number of sensitive neurons is maximized by particle swarm optimization, thus diverse corner cases could be triggered and neuron coverage be further improved when compared with baselines. Besides, considerable robustness enhancement can be reached when adopting testing examples based on neuron sensitivity for retraining. Extensive experiments implemented on scalable datasets and models can well demonstrate the testing effectiveness and robustness improvement of DeepSensor.

**Abstract:** Despite its benefits for children's skill development and parent-child bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy's design highlighted the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy's usability and suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.

**Abstract:** This paper investigates the parameter space of machine learning (ML) algorithms in aggravating or mitigating fairness bugs. Data-driven software is increasingly applied in social-critical applications where ensuring fairness is of paramount importance. The existing approaches focus on addressing fairness bugs by either modifying the input dataset or modifying the learning algorithms. On the other hand, the selection of hyperparameters, which provide finer controls of ML algorithms, may enable a less intrusive approach to influence the fairness. Can hyperparameters amplify or suppress discrimination present in the input dataset? How can we help programmers in detecting, understanding, and exploiting the role of hyperparameters to improve the fairness?
  We design three search-based software testing algorithms to uncover the precision-fairness frontier of the hyperparameter space. We complement these algorithms with statistical debugging to explain the role of these parameters in improving fairness. We implement the proposed approaches in the tool Parfait-ML (PARameter FAIrness Testing for ML Libraries) and show its effectiveness and utility over five mature ML algorithms as used in six social-critical applications. In these applications, our approach successfully identified hyperparameters that significantly improve (vis-a-vis the state-of-the-art techniques) the fairness without sacrificing precision. Surprisingly, for some algorithms (e.g., random forest), our approach showed that certain configuration of hyperparameters (e.g., restricting the search space of attributes) can amplify biases across applications. Upon further investigation, we found intuitive explanations of these phenomena, and the results corroborate similar observations from the literature.

**Abstract:** Learning symbolic music representations, especially disentangled representations with probabilistic interpretations, has been shown to benefit both music understanding and generation. However, most models are only applicable to short-term music, while learning long-term music representations remains a challenging task. We have seen several studies attempting to learn hierarchical representations directly in an end-to-end manner, but these models have not been able to achieve the desired results and the training process is not stable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn long-term symbolic music representations through contextual constraints. First, we use contrastive learning to pre-train a long-term representation by constraining its difference from the short-term representation (extracted by an off-the-shelf model). Then, we fine-tune the long-term representation by a hierarchical prediction model such that a good long-term representation (e.g., an 8-bar representation) can reconstruct the corresponding short-term ones (e.g., the 2-bar representations within the 8-bar range). Experiments show that our method stabilizes the training and the fine-tuning steps. In addition, the designed contextual constraints benefit both reconstruction and disentanglement, significantly outperforming the baselines.

<p>

**Abstract:** The task of ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) seeks to predict diverse and free-form words or phrases that describe the appropriate types of entities mentioned in sentences. A key challenge for this task lies in the large amount of types and the scarcity of annotated data per type. Existing systems formulate the task as a multi-way classification problem and train directly or distantly supervised classifiers. This causes two issues: (i) the classifiers do not capture the type semantics since types are often converted into indices; (ii) systems developed in this way are limited to predicting within a pre-defined type set, and often fall short of generalizing to types that are rarely seen or unseen in training. This work presents LITE, a new approach that formulates entity typing as a natural language inference (NLI) problem, making use of (i) the indirect supervision from NLI to infer type information meaningfully represented as textual hypotheses and alleviate the data scarcity issue, as well as (ii) a learning-to-rank objective to avoid the pre-defining of a type set. Experiments show that, with limited training data, LITE obtains state-of-the-art performance on the UFET task. In addition, LITE demonstrates its strong generalizability, by not only yielding best results on other fine-grained entity typing benchmarks, more importantly, a pre-trained LITE system works well on new data containing unseen types.

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are artificial learning systems typically based on two operations: convolution, which implements feature extraction through filtering, and pooling, which implements dimensionality reduction. The impact of pooling in the classification performance of the CNNs has been highlighted in several previous works, and a variety of alternative pooling operators have been proposed. However, only a few of them tackle with the uncertainty that is naturally propagated from the input layer to the feature maps of the hidden layers through convolutions. In this paper we present a novel pooling operation based on (type-1) fuzzy sets to cope with the local imprecision of the feature maps, and we investigate its performance in the context of image classification. Fuzzy pooling is performed by fuzzification, aggregation and defuzzification of feature map neighborhoods. It is used for the construction of a fuzzy pooling layer that can be applied as a drop-in replacement of the current, crisp, pooling layers of CNN architectures. Several experiments using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach can enhance the classification performance of a CNN. A comparative evaluation shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art pooling approaches.

**Abstract:** We introduce and study the online Bayesian recommendation problem for a platform, who can observe a utility-relevant state of a product, repeatedly interacting with a population of myopic users through an online recommendation mechanism. This paradigm is common in a wide range of scenarios in the current Internet economy. For each user with her own private preference and belief, the platform commits to a recommendation strategy to utilize his information advantage on the product state to persuade the self-interested user to follow the recommendation. The platform does not know user's preferences and beliefs, and has to use an adaptive recommendation strategy to persuade with gradually learning user's preferences and beliefs in the process.
  We aim to design online learning policies with no Stackelberg regret for the platform, i.e., against the optimum policy in hindsight under the assumption that users will correspondingly adapt their behaviors to the benchmark policy. Our first result is an online policy that achieves double logarithm regret dependence on the number of rounds. We then present a hardness result showing that no adaptive online policy can achieve regret with better dependency on the number of rounds. Finally, by formulating the platform's problem as optimizing a linear program with membership oracle access, we present our second online policy that achieves regret with polynomial dependence on the number of states but logarithm dependence on the number of rounds.

**Abstract:** The fast-spreading information over the internet is essential to support the rapid supply of numerous public utility services and entertainment to users. Social networks and online media paved the way for modern, timely-communication-fashion and convenient access to all types of information. However, it also provides new chances for ill use of the massive amount of available data, such as spreading fake content to manipulate public opinion. Detection of counterfeit content has raised attention in the last few years for the advances in deepfake generation. The rapid growth of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, can predict fake content in several application domains, including fake image and video manipulation. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent studies for deepfake content detection using deep learning-based approaches. We aim to broaden the state-of-the-art research by systematically reviewing the different categories of fake content detection. Furthermore, we report the advantages and drawbacks of the examined works and future directions towards the issues and shortcomings still unsolved on deepfake detection.

**Abstract:** Abstract object properties and their relations are deeply rooted in human common sense, allowing people to predict the dynamics of the world even in situations that are novel but governed by familiar laws of physics. Standard machine learning models in model-based reinforcement learning are inadequate to generalize in this way. Inspired by the classic framework of noisy indeterministic deictic (NID) rules, we introduce here Neural NID, a method that learns abstract object properties and relations between objects with a suitably regularized graph neural network. We validate the greater generalization capability of Neural NID on simple benchmarks specifically designed to assess the transition dynamics learned by the model.

**Abstract:** We present an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning(RL) framework for robotic manipulation tasks, using a robust and efficient keypoints representation. The proposed method learns keypoints from camera images as the state representation, through a self-supervised autoencoder architecture. The keypoints encode the geometric information, as well as the relationship of the tool and target in a compact representation to ensure efficient and robust learning. After keypoints learning, the RL step then learns the robot motion from the extracted keypoints state representation. The keypoints and RL learning processes are entirely done in the simulated environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on robotic manipulation tasks including grasping and pushing, in different scenarios. We also investigate the generalization capability of the trained model. In addition to the robust keypoints representation, we further apply domain randomization and adversarial training examples to achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

**Abstract:** Survival analysis (SA) is an active field of research that is concerned with time-to-event outcomes and is prevalent in many domains, particularly biomedical applications. Despite its importance, SA remains challenging due to small-scale data sets and complex outcome distributions, concealed by truncation and censoring processes. The piecewise exponential additive mixed model (PAMM) is a model class addressing many of these challenges, yet PAMMs are not applicable in high-dimensional feature settings or in the case of unstructured or multimodal data. We unify existing approaches by proposing DeepPAMM, a versatile deep learning framework that is well-founded from a statistical point of view, yet with enough flexibility for modeling complex hazard structures. We illustrate that DeepPAMM is competitive with other machine learning approaches with respect to predictive performance while maintaining interpretability through benchmark experiments and an extended case study.

**Abstract:** Understanding deep learning models is important for EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI), since it not only can boost trust of end users but also potentially shed light on reasons that cause a model to fail. However, deep learning interpretability has not yet raised wide attention in this field. It remains unknown how reliably existing interpretation techniques can be used and to which extent they can reflect the model decisions. In order to fill this research gap, we conduct the first quantitative evaluation and explore the best practice of interpreting deep learning models designed for EEG-based BCI. We design metrics and test seven well-known interpretation techniques on benchmark deep learning models. Results show that methods of GradientInput, DeepLIFT, integrated gradient, and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) have similar and better performance than saliency map, deconvolution and guided backpropagation methods for interpreting the model decisions. In addition, we propose a set of processing steps that allow the interpretation results to be visualized in an understandable and trusted way. Finally, we illustrate with samples on how deep learning interpretability can benefit the domain of EEG-based BCI. Our work presents a promising direction of introducing deep learning interpretability to EEG-based BCI.

**Abstract:** The current methods for learning representations with auto-encoders almost exclusively employ vectors as the latent representations. In this work, we propose to employ a tensor product structure for this purpose. This way, the obtained representations are naturally disentangled. In contrast to the conventional variations methods, which are targeted toward normally distributed features, the latent space in our representation is distributed uniformly over a set of unit circles. We argue that the torus structure of the latent space captures the generative factors effectively. We employ recent tools for measuring unsupervised disentanglement, and in an extensive set of experiments demonstrate the advantage of our method in terms of disentanglement, completeness, and informativeness. The code for our proposed method is available at https://github.com/rotmanmi/Unsupervised-Disentanglement-Torus.

**Abstract:** With the field of rigid-body robotics having matured in the last fifty years, routing, planning, and manipulation of deformable objects have emerged in recent years as a more untouched research area in many fields ranging from surgical robotics to industrial assembly and construction. Routing approaches for deformable objects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g., Learning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the environment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely separate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing and manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of planning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space.
  This paper proposes a novel approach to spatial representation combined with route planning that allows efficient routing of deformable one-dimensional objects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, threads). The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition of the space into convex subspaces, which allows an efficient coding of the configuration. Having such a configuration, the routing problem can be solved using a dynamic programming matching method with a quadratic time and space complexity. The proposed method couples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our tests and experiments show the method correctly computing the next manipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing and manipulation tasks.

<p>

**Abstract:** The modelling of multiphase flow in a pipe presents a significant challenge for high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models due to the high aspect ratio (length over diameter) of the domain. In subsea applications, the pipe length can be several hundreds of kilometres versus a pipe diameter of just a few inches. In this paper, we present a new AI-based non-intrusive reduced-order model within a domain decomposition framework (AI-DDNIROM) which is capable of making predictions for domains significantly larger than the domain used in training. This is achieved by using domain decomposition; dimensionality reduction; training a neural network to make predictions for a single subdomain; and by using an iteration-by-subdomain technique to converge the solution over the whole domain. To find the low-dimensional space, we explore several types of autoencoder networks, known for their ability to compress information accurately and compactly. The performance of the autoencoders is assessed on two advection-dominated problems: flow past a cylinder and slug flow in a pipe. To make predictions in time, we exploit an adversarial network which aims to learn the distribution of the training data, in addition to learning the mapping between particular inputs and outputs. This type of network has shown the potential to produce realistic outputs. The whole framework is applied to multiphase slug flow in a horizontal pipe for which an AI-DDNIROM is trained on high-fidelity CFD simulations of a pipe of length 10 m with an aspect ratio of 13:1, and tested by simulating the flow for a pipe of length 98 m with an aspect ratio of almost 130:1. Statistics of the flows obtained from the CFD simulations are compared to those of the AI-DDNIROM predictions to demonstrate the success of our approach.

**Abstract:** We study a family of first-order methods with momentum based on mirror descent for online convex optimization, which we dub online mirror descent with momentum (OMDM). Our algorithms include as special cases gradient descent and exponential weights update with momentum. We provide a new and simple analysis of momentum-based methods in a stochastic setting that yields a regret bound that decreases as momentum increases. This immediately establishes that momentum can help in the convergence of stochastic subgradient descent in convex nonsmooth optimization. We showcase the robustness of our algorithm by also providing an analysis in an adversarial setting that gives the first non-trivial regret bounds for OMDM. Our work aims to provide a better understanding of the benefits of momentum-based methods, which despite their recent empirical success, is incomplete.
  Finally, we discuss how OMDM can be applied to stochastic online allocation problems, which are central problems in computer science and operations research. In doing so, we establish an important connection between OMDM and popular approaches from optimal control such as PID controllers, thereby providing regret bounds on the performance of PID controllers. The improvements of momentum are most pronounced when the step-size is large, thereby indicating that momentum provides a robustness to misspecification of tuning parameters. We provide a numerical evaluation that verifies the robustness of our algorithms.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of combining and learning over a set of adversarial bandit algorithms with the goal of adaptively tracking the best one on the fly. The CORRAL algorithm of Agarwal et al. (2017) and its variants (Foster et al., 2020a) achieve this goal with a regret overhead of order $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{MT})$ where $M$ is the number of base algorithms and $T$ is the time horizon. The polynomial dependence on $M$, however, prevents one from applying these algorithms to many applications where $M$ is poly$(T)$ or even larger. Motivated by this issue, we propose a new recipe to corral a larger band of bandit algorithms whose regret overhead has only \emph{logarithmic} dependence on $M$ as long as some conditions are satisfied. As the main example, we apply our recipe to the problem of adversarial linear bandits over a $d$-dimensional $\ell_p$ unit-ball for $p \in (1,2]$. By corralling a large set of $T$ base algorithms, each starting at a different time step, our final algorithm achieves the first optimal switching regret $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d S T})$ when competing against a sequence of comparators with $S$ switches (for some known $S$). We further extend our results to linear bandits over a smooth and strongly convex domain as well as unconstrained linear bandits.

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of adversarial bandit convex optimization, that is, online learning over a sequence of arbitrary convex loss functions with only one function evaluation for each of them. While all previous works assume known and homogeneous curvature on these loss functions, we study a heterogeneous setting where each function has its own curvature that is only revealed after the learner makes a decision. We develop an efficient algorithm that is able to adapt to the curvature on the fly. Specifically, our algorithm not only recovers or \emph{even improves} existing results for several homogeneous settings, but also leads to surprising results for some heterogeneous settings -- for example, while Hazan and Levy (2014) showed that $\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable for a sequence of $T$ smooth and strongly convex $d$-dimensional functions, our algorithm reveals that the same is achievable even if $T^{3/4}$ of them are not strongly convex, and sometimes even if a constant fraction of them are not strongly convex. Our approach is inspired by the framework of Bartlett et al. (2007) who studied a similar heterogeneous setting but with stronger gradient feedback. Extending their framework to the bandit feedback setting requires novel ideas such as lifting the feasible domain and using a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier regularizer.

**Abstract:** We consider a seller faced with buyers which have the ability to delay their decision, which we call patience. Each buyer's type is composed of value and patience, and it is sampled i.i.d. from a distribution. The seller, using posted prices, would like to maximize her revenue from selling to the buyer. Our main results are the following.
  $\bullet$ We formalize this setting and characterize the resulting Stackelberg equilibrium, where the seller first commits to her strategy and then the buyers best respond.
  $\bullet$ We show a separation between the best fixed price, the best pure strategy, which is a fixed sequence of prices, and the best mixed strategy, which is a distribution over price sequences.
  $\bullet$ We characterize both the optimal pure strategy of the seller and the buyer's best response strategy to any seller's mixed strategy.
  $\bullet$ We show how to compute efficiently the optimal pure strategy and give an algorithm for the optimal mixed strategy (which is exponential in the maximum patience).
  We then consider a learning setting, where the seller does not have access to the distribution over buyer's types. Our main results are the following.
  $\bullet$ We derive a sample complexity bound for the learning of an approximate optimal pure strategy, by computing the fat-shattering dimension of this setting.
  $\bullet$ We give a general sample complexity bound for the approximate optimal mixed strategy.
  $\bullet$ We consider an online setting and derive a vanishing regret bound with respect to both the optimal pure strategy and the optimal mixed strategy.

**Abstract:** Accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for the diagnosis and assessment of cerebrovascular diseases such as Moyamoya, carotid stenosis, aneurysms, and stroke. Positron emission tomography (PET) is currently regarded as the gold standard for the measurement of CBF in the human brain. PET imaging, however, is not widely available because of its prohibitive costs, use of ionizing radiation, and logistical challenges, which require a co-localized cyclotron to deliver the 2 min half-life Oxygen-15 radioisotope. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more readily available and does not involve ionizing radiation. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning framework for brain MRI-to-PET translation and disease diagnosis. The proposed framework comprises two prime networks: (1) an attention-based 3D encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) that synthesizes high-quality PET CBF maps from multi-contrast MRI images, and (2) a multi-scale 3D CNN that identifies the brain disease corresponding to the input MRI images. Our multi-task framework yields promising results on the task of MRI-to-PET translation, achieving an average structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.94 and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 38dB on a cohort of 120 subjects. In addition, we show that integrating multiple MRI modalities can improve the clinical diagnosis of brain diseases.

**Abstract:** People undergoing neuromuscular dysfunctions and amputated limbs require automatic prosthetic appliances. In developing such prostheses, the precise detection of brain motor actions is imperative for the Grasp-and-Lift (GAL) tasks. Because of the low-cost and non-invasive essence of Electroencephalography (EEG), it is widely preferred for detecting motor actions during the controls of prosthetic tools. This article has automated the hand movement activity viz GAL detection method from the 32-channel EEG signals. The proposed pipeline essentially combines preprocessing and end-to-end detection steps, eliminating the requirement of hand-crafted feature engineering. Preprocessing action consists of raw signal denoising, using either Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) or highpass or bandpass filtering and data standardization. The detection step consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based model. All the investigations utilize the publicly available WAY-EEG-GAL dataset, having six different GAL events. The best experiment reveals that the proposed framework achieves an average area under the ROC curve of 0.944, employing the DWT-based denoising filter, data standardization, and CNN-based detection model. The obtained outcome designates an excellent achievement of the introduced method in detecting GAL events from the EEG signals, turning it applicable to prosthetic appliances, brain-computer interfaces, robotic arms, etc.

**Abstract:** Catering to the proliferation of Internet of Things devices and distributed machine learning at the edge, we propose an energy harvesting federated learning (EHFL) framework in this paper. The introduction of EH implies that a client's availability to participate in any FL round cannot be guaranteed, which complicates the theoretical analysis. We derive novel convergence bounds that capture the impact of time-varying device availabilities due to the random EH characteristics of the participating clients, for both parallel and local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with non-convex loss functions. The results suggest that having a uniform client scheduling that maximizes the minimum number of clients throughout the FL process is desirable, which is further corroborated by the numerical experiments using a real-world FL task and a state-of-the-art EH scheduler.

**Abstract:** The performance of supervised deep learning methods for medical image segmentation is often limited by the scarcity of labeled data. As a promising research direction, semi-supervised learning addresses this dilemma by leveraging unlabeled data information to assist the learning process. In this paper, a novel geometry-aware semi-supervised learning framework is proposed for medical image segmentation, which is a consistency-based method. Considering that the hard-to-segment regions are mainly located around the object boundary, we introduce an auxiliary prediction task to learn the global geometric information. Based on the geometric constraint, the ambiguous boundary regions are emphasized through an exponentially weighted strategy for the model training to better exploit both labeled and unlabeled data. In addition, a dual-view network is designed to perform segmentation from different perspectives and reduce the prediction uncertainty. The proposed method is evaluated on the public left atrium benchmark dataset and improves fully supervised method by 8.7% in Dice with 10% labeled images, while 4.3% with 20% labeled images. Meanwhile, our framework outperforms six state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods.

**Abstract:** When a clinician refers a patient for an imaging exam, they include the reason (e.g. relevant patient history, suspected disease) in the scan request; this appears as the indication field in the radiology report. The interpretation and reporting of the image are substantially influenced by this request text, steering the radiologist to focus on particular aspects of the image. We use the indication field to drive better image classification, by taking a transformer network which is unimodally pre-trained on text (BERT) and fine-tuning it for multimodal classification of a dual image-text input. We evaluate the method on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, and present ablation studies to investigate the effect of the indication field on the classification performance. The experimental results show our approach achieves 87.8 average micro AUROC, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for unimodal (84.4) and multimodal (86.0) classification.

**Abstract:** Benign overfitting demonstrates that overparameterized models can perform well on test data while fitting noisy training data. However, it only considers the final min-norm solution in linear regression, which ignores the algorithm information and the corresponding training procedure. In this paper, we generalize the idea of benign overfitting to the whole training trajectory instead of the min-norm solution and derive a time-variant bound based on the trajectory analysis. Starting from the time-variant bound, we further derive a time interval that suffices to guarantee a consistent generalization error for a given feature covariance. Unlike existing approaches, the newly proposed generalization bound is characterized by a time-variant effective dimension of feature covariance. By introducing the time factor, we relax the strict assumption on the feature covariance matrix required in previous benign overfitting under the regimes of overparameterized linear regression with gradient descent. This paper extends the scope of benign overfitting, and experiment results indicate that the proposed bound accords better with empirical evidence.

**Abstract:** Source code authorship attribution is an important problem often encountered in applications such as software forensics, bug fixing, and software quality analysis. Recent studies show that current source code authorship attribution methods can be compromised by attackers exploiting adversarial examples and coding style manipulation. This calls for robust solutions to the problem of code authorship attribution. In this paper, we initiate the study on making Deep Learning (DL)-based code authorship attribution robust. We propose an innovative framework called Robust coding style Patterns Generation (RoPGen), which essentially learns authors' unique coding style patterns that are hard for attackers to manipulate or imitate. The key idea is to combine data augmentation and gradient augmentation at the adversarial training phase. This effectively increases the diversity of training examples, generates meaningful perturbations to gradients of deep neural networks, and learns diversified representations of coding styles. We evaluate the effectiveness of RoPGen using four datasets of programs written in C, C++, and Java. Experimental results show that RoPGen can significantly improve the robustness of DL-based code authorship attribution, by respectively reducing 22.8% and 41.0% of the success rate of targeted and untargeted attacks on average.

**Abstract:** We tackle the problem of image inpainting in the remote sensing domain. Remote sensing images possess high resolution and geographical variations, that render the conventional inpainting methods less effective. This further entails the requirement of models with high complexity to sufficiently capture the spectral, spatial and textural nuances within an image, emerging from its high spatial variability. To this end, we propose a novel inpainting method that individually focuses on each aspect of an image such as edges, colour and texture using a task specific GAN. Moreover, each individual GAN also incorporates the attention mechanism that explicitly extracts the spectral and spatial features. To ensure consistent gradient flow, the model uses residual learning paradigm, thus simultaneously working with high and low level features. We evaluate our model, alongwith previous state of the art models, on the two well known remote sensing datasets, Open Cities AI and Earth on Canvas, and achieve competitive performance.

**Abstract:** Recently, graph collaborative filtering methods have been proposed as an effective recommendation approach, which can capture users' preference over items by modeling the user-item interaction graphs. In order to reduce the influence of data sparsity, contrastive learning is adopted in graph collaborative filtering for enhancing the performance. However, these methods typically construct the contrastive pairs by random sampling, which neglect the neighboring relations among users (or items) and fail to fully exploit the potential of contrastive learning for recommendation. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach, named Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning, named NCL, which explicitly incorporates the potential neighbors into contrastive pairs. Specifically, we introduce the neighbors of a user (or an item) from graph structure and semantic space respectively. For the structural neighbors on the interaction graph, we develop a novel structure-contrastive objective that regards users (or items) and their structural neighbors as positive contrastive pairs. In implementation, the representations of users (or items) and neighbors correspond to the outputs of different GNN layers. Furthermore, to excavate the potential neighbor relation in semantic space, we assume that users with similar representations are within the semantic neighborhood, and incorporate these semantic neighbors into the prototype-contrastive objective. The proposed NCL can be optimized with EM algorithm and generalized to apply to graph collaborative filtering methods. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCL, notably with 26% and 17% performance gain over a competitive graph collaborative filtering base model on the Yelp and Amazon-book datasets respectively. Our code is available at: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/NCL.

**Abstract:** Existing approaches for embedding unobtrusive tags inside 3D objects require either complex fabrication or high-cost imaging equipment. We present InfraredTags, which are 2D markers and barcodes imperceptible to the naked eye that can be 3D printed as part of objects, and detected rapidly by low-cost near-infrared cameras. We achieve this by printing objects from an infrared-transmitting filament, which infrared cameras can see through, and by having air gaps inside for the tag's bits, which appear at a different intensity in the infrared image.
  We built a user interface that facilitates the integration of common tags (QR codes, ArUco markers) with the object geometry to make them 3D printable as InfraredTags. We also developed a low-cost infrared imaging module that augments existing mobile devices and decodes tags using our image processing pipeline. Our evaluation shows that the tags can be detected with little near-infrared illumination (0.2lux) and from distances as far as 250cm. We demonstrate how our method enables various applications, such as object tracking and embedding metadata for augmented reality and tangible interactions.

**Abstract:** Evolving Neural Networks (NNs) has recently seen an increasing interest as an alternative path that might be more successful. It has many advantages compared to other approaches, such as learning the architecture of the NNs. However, the extremely large search space and the existence of many complex interacting parts still represent a major obstacle. Many criteria were recently investigated to help guide the algorithm and to cut down the large search space. Recently there has been growing research bringing insights from network science to improve the design of NNs. In this paper, we investigate evolving NNs architectures that have one of the most fundamental characteristics of real-world networks, namely the optimal balance between connections cost and information flow. The performance of different metrics that represent this balance is evaluated and the improvement in the accuracy of putting more selection pressure toward this balance is demonstrated on three datasets.

**Abstract:** Neural population activity relating to behaviour is assumed to be inherently low-dimensional despite the observed high dimensionality of data recorded using multi-electrode arrays. Therefore, predicting behaviour from neural population recordings has been shown to be most effective when using latent variable models. Over time however, the activity of single neurons can drift, and different neurons will be recorded due to movement of implanted neural probes. This means that a decoder trained to predict behaviour on one day performs worse when tested on a different day. On the other hand, evidence suggests that the latent dynamics underlying behaviour may be stable even over months and years. Based on this idea, we introduce a model capable of inferring behaviourally relevant latent dynamics from previously unseen data recorded from the same animal, without any need for decoder recalibration. We show that unsupervised domain adaptation combined with a sequential variational autoencoder, trained on several sessions, can achieve good generalisation to unseen data and correctly predict behaviour where conventional methods fail. Our results further support the hypothesis that behaviour-related neural dynamics are low-dimensional and stable over time, and will enable more effective and flexible use of brain computer interface technologies.

**Abstract:** It is common practice to discretize continuous defect counts into defective and non-defective classes and use them as a target variable when building defect classifiers (discretized classifiers). However, this discretization of continuous defect counts leads to information loss that might affect the performance and interpretation of defect classifiers. Another possible approach to build defect classifiers is through the use of regression models then discretizing the predicted defect counts into defective and non-defective classes (regression-based classifiers).
  In this paper, we compare the performance and interpretation of defect classifiers that are built using both approaches (i.e., discretized classifiers and regression-based classifiers) across six commonly used machine learning classifiers (i.e., linear/logistic regression, random forest, KNN, SVM, CART, and neural networks) and 17 datasets. We find that: i) Random forest based classifiers outperform other classifiers (best AUC) for both classifier building approaches; ii) In contrast to common practice, building a defect classifier using discretized defect counts (i.e., discretized classifiers) does not always lead to better performance.
  Hence we suggest that future defect classification studies should consider building regression-based classifiers (in particular when the defective ratio of the modeled dataset is low). Moreover, we suggest that both approaches for building defect classifiers should be explored, so the best-performing classifier can be used when determining the most influential features.

**Abstract:** Issue tracking systems are used in the software industry for the facilitation of maintenance activities that keep the software robust and up to date with ever-changing industry requirements. Usually, users report issues that can be categorized into different labels such as bug reports, enhancement requests, and questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make the labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which leads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective categories i.e. bug, enhancement, and question. This is a challenging task because of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing studies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting key-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship between words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false negatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify the issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue report with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to classify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf neural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports. We validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial projects from GitHub. We were able to achieve promising F-1 scores of 81%, 74%, and 80% for bug reports, enhancements, and questions, respectively. We also develop an industry tool called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), which automatically assigns labels to newly reported issues on GitHub repositories with high accuracy.

**Abstract:** Researchers usually discretize a continuous dependent variable into two target classes by introducing an artificial discretization threshold (e.g., median). However, such discretization may introduce noise (i.e., discretization noise) due to ambiguous class loyalty of data points that are close to the artificial threshold. Previous studies do not provide a clear directive on the impact of discretization noise on the classifiers and how to handle such noise. In this paper, we propose a framework to help researchers and practitioners systematically estimate the impact of discretization noise on classifiers in terms of its impact on various performance measures and the interpretation of classifiers. Through a case study of 7 software engineering datasets, we find that: 1) discretization noise affects the different performance measures of a classifier differently for different datasets; 2) Though the interpretation of the classifiers are impacted by the discretization noise on the whole, the top 3 most important features are not affected by the discretization noise. Therefore, we suggest that practitioners and researchers use our framework to understand the impact of discretization noise on the performance of their built classifiers and estimate the exact amount of discretization noise to be discarded from the dataset to avoid the negative impact of such noise.

**Abstract:** With the increasing demands on e-commerce platforms, numerous user action history is emerging. Those enriched action records are vital to understand users' interests and intents. Recently, prior works for user behavior prediction mainly focus on the interactions with product-side information. However, the interactions with search queries, which usually act as a bridge between users and products, are still under investigated. In this paper, we explore a new problem named temporal event forecasting, a generalized user behavior prediction task in a unified query product evolutionary graph, to embrace both query and product recommendation in a temporal manner. To fulfill this setting, there involves two challenges: (1) the action data for most users is scarce; (2) user preferences are dynamically evolving and shifting over time. To tackle those issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Enhanced Temporal Event (RETE) forecasting framework. Unlike existing methods that enhance user representations via roughly absorbing information from connected entities in the whole graph, RETE efficiently and dynamically retrieves relevant entities centrally on each user as high-quality subgraphs, preventing the noise propagation from the densely evolutionary graph structures that incorporate abundant search queries. And meanwhile, RETE autoregressively accumulates retrieval-enhanced user representations from each time step, to capture evolutionary patterns for joint query and product prediction. Empirically, extensive experiments on both the public benchmark and four real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETE method.

**Abstract:** Cancer is one of the most common and fatal diseases in the world. Breast cancer affects one in every eight women and one in every eight hundred men. Hence, our prime target should be early detection of cancer because the early detection of cancer can be helpful to cure cancer effectively. Therefore, we propose a saliency detection system with the help of advanced deep learning techniques, such that the machine will be taught to emulate actions of pathologists for localization of diagnostically pertinent regions. We study identification of five diagnostic categories of breast cancer by training a CNN (VGG16, ResNet architecture). We have used BreakHis dataset to train our model. We focus on both detection and classification of cancerous regions in histopathology images. The diagnostically relevant regions are salient. The detection system will be available as an open source web application which can be used by pathologists and medical institutions.

**Abstract:** The proliferation of deep learning applications in several areas has led to the rapid adoption of such solutions from an ever-growing number of institutions and companies. The deep neural network (DNN) models developed by these entities are often trained on proprietary data. They require powerful computational resources, with the resulting DNN models being incorporated in the company's work pipeline or provided as a service. Being trained on proprietary information, these models provide a competitive edge for the owner company. At the same time, these models can be attractive to competitors (or malicious entities), which can employ state-of-the-art security attacks to steal and use these models for their benefit. As these attacks are hard to prevent, it becomes imperative to have mechanisms that enable an affected entity to verify the ownership of a DNN with high confidence.
  This paper presents TATTOOED, a robust and efficient DNN watermarking technique based on spread-spectrum channel coding. TATTOOED has a negligible effect on the performance of the DNN model and requires as little as one iteration to watermark a DNN model. We extensively evaluate TATTOOED against several state-of-the-art mechanisms used to remove watermarks from DNNs. Our results show that TATTOOED is robust to such removal techniques even in extreme scenarios. For example, if the removal techniques such as fine-tuning and parameter pruning change as much as 99\% of the model parameters, the TATTOOED watermark is still present in full in the DNN model, and ensures ownership verification.

**Abstract:** Cooperative perception of connected vehicles comes to the rescue when the field of view restricts stand-alone intelligence. While raw-level cooperative perception preserves most information to guarantee accuracy, it is demanding in communication bandwidth and computation power. Therefore, it is important to schedule the most beneficial vehicle to share its sensor in terms of supplementary view and stable network connection. In this paper, we present a model of raw-level cooperative perception and formulate the energy minimization problem of sensor sharing scheduling as a variant of the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem. Specifically, volatility of the neighboring vehicles, heterogeneity of V2X channels, and the time-varying traffic context are taken into consideration. Then we propose an online learning-based algorithm with logarithmic performance loss, achieving a decent trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Simulation results under different scenarios indicate that the proposed algorithm quickly learns to schedule the optimal cooperative vehicle and saves more energy as compared to baseline algorithms.

**Abstract:** Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of female mortality in the world. This can be reduced when diagnoses are performed at the early stages of progression. Further, the efficiency of the process can be significantly improved with computer aided diagnosis. Deep learning based approaches have been successfully applied to achieve this. One of the limiting factors for training deep networks in a supervised manner is the dependency on large amounts of expert annotated data. In reality, large amounts of unlabelled data and only small amounts of expert annotated data are available. In such scenarios, transfer learning approaches and self-supervised learning (SSL) based approaches can be leveraged. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervision pretext task to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and extract domain specific features. This method was compared with deep features extracted using pre-trained CNNs such as DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet. Additionally, two types of patch-combination methods were introduced and compared with majority voting. The methods were validated on the BACH microscopy images dataset. Results indicated that the best performance of 99% sensitivity was achieved for the deep features extracted using ResNet50 with concatenation of patch-level embedding. Preliminary results of SSL to extract domain specific features indicated that with just 15% of unlabelled data a high sensitivity of 94% can be achieved for a four class classification of microscopy images.

**Abstract:** Since the birth of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrencies have emerged to become a global phenomenon and an important decentralized financial asset. Due to this decentralization, the value of these digital currencies against fiat currencies is highly volatile over time. Therefore, forecasting the crypto-fiat currency exchange rate is an extremely challenging task. For reliable forecasting, this paper proposes a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble approach that employs all modalities which derive price fluctuation such as social media sentiments, search volumes, blockchain information, and trading data. To better support investment decision making, the approach forecasts also the fluctuation distribution. The conducted extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of relying on multimodalities instead of only trading data. Further experiments demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed approach compared to existing tools and methods with a 19.29% improvement.
