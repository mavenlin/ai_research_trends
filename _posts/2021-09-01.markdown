**Abstract:** A physics-informed neural network (PINN) that combines deep learning with physics is studied to solve the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation for learning nonlinear dynamics in fiber optics. We carry out a systematic investigation and comprehensive verification on PINN for multiple physical effects in optical fibers, including dispersion, self-phase modulation, and higher-order nonlinear effects. Moreover, both special case (soliton propagation) and general case (multi-pulse propagation) are investigated and realized with PINN. In the previous studies, the PINN was mainly effective for single scenario. To overcome this problem, the physical parameters (pulse peak power and amplitudes of sub-pulses) are hereby embedded as additional input parameter controllers, which allow PINN to learn the physical constraints of different scenarios and perform good generalizability. Furthermore, PINN exhibits better performance than the data-driven neural network using much less data, and its computational complexity (in terms of number of multiplications) is much lower than that of the split-step Fourier method. The results report here show that the PINN is not only an effective partial differential equation solver, but also a prospective technique to advance the scientific computing and automatic modeling in fiber optics.

**Abstract:** Imperfections in data annotation, known as label noise, are detrimental to the training of machine learning models and have an often-overlooked confounding effect on the assessment of model performance. Nevertheless, employing experts to remove label noise by fully re-annotating large datasets is infeasible in resource-constrained settings, such as healthcare. This work advocates for a data-driven approach to prioritising samples for re-annotation - which we term "active label cleaning". We propose to rank instances according to estimated label correctness and labelling difficulty of each sample, and introduce a simulation framework to evaluate relabelling efficacy. Our experiments on natural images and on a new medical imaging benchmark show that cleaning noisy labels mitigates their negative impact on model training, evaluation, and selection. Crucially, the proposed active label cleaning enables correcting labels up to 4 times more effectively than typical random selection in realistic conditions, making better use of experts' valuable time for improving dataset quality.

**Abstract:** Can machines learn to use a search engine as an interactive tool for finding information? That would have far reaching consequences for making the world's knowledge more accessible. This paper presents first steps in designing agents that learn meta-strategies for contextual query refinements. Our approach uses machine reading to guide the selection of refinement terms from aggregated search results. Agents are then empowered with simple but effective search operators to exert fine-grained and transparent control over queries and search results. We develop a novel way of generating synthetic search sessions, which leverages the power of transformer-based generative language models through (self-)supervised learning. We also present a reinforcement learning agent with dynamically constrained actions that can learn interactive search strategies completely from scratch. In both cases, we obtain significant improvements over one-shot search with a strong information retrieval baseline. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the learned search policies.

**Abstract:** Benchmark datasets that measure camera pose accuracy have driven progress in visual re-localisation research. To obtain poses for thousands of images, it is common to use a reference algorithm to generate pseudo ground truth. Popular choices include Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous-Localisation-and-Mapping (SLAM) using additional sensors like depth cameras if available. Re-localisation benchmarks thus measure how well each method replicates the results of the reference algorithm. This begs the question whether the choice of the reference algorithm favours a certain family of re-localisation methods. This paper analyzes two widely used re-localisation datasets and shows that evaluation outcomes indeed vary with the choice of the reference algorithm. We thus question common beliefs in the re-localisation literature, namely that learning-based scene coordinate regression outperforms classical feature-based methods, and that RGB-D-based methods outperform RGB-based methods. We argue that any claims on ranking re-localisation methods should take the type of the reference algorithm, and the similarity of the methods to the reference algorithm, into account.

**Abstract:** Audio segmentation and sound event detection are crucial topics in machine listening that aim to detect acoustic classes and their respective boundaries. It is useful for audio-content analysis, speech recognition, audio-indexing, and music information retrieval. In recent years, most research articles adopt segmentation-by-classification. This technique divides audio into small frames and individually performs classification on these frames. In this paper, we present a novel approach called You Only Hear Once (YOHO), which is inspired by the YOLO algorithm popularly adopted in Computer Vision. We convert the detection of acoustic boundaries into a regression problem instead of frame-based classification. This is done by having separate output neurons to detect the presence of an audio class and predict its start and end points. YOHO obtained a higher F-measure and lower error rate than the state-of-the-art Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network on multiple datasets. As YOHO is purely a convolutional neural network and has no recurrent layers, it is faster during inference. In addition, as this approach is more end-to-end and predicts acoustic boundaries directly, it is significantly quicker during post-processing and smoothing.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation aims to enrich training samples for alleviating the overfitting issue in low-resource or class-imbalanced situations. Traditional methods first devise task-specific operations such as Synonym Substitute, then preset the corresponding parameters such as the substitution rate artificially, which require a lot of prior knowledge and are prone to fall into the sub-optimum. Besides, the number of editing operations is limited in the previous methods, which decreases the diversity of the augmented data and thus restricts the performance gain. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a framework named Text AutoAugment (TAA) to establish a compositional and learnable paradigm for data augmentation. We regard a combination of various operations as an augmentation policy and utilize an efficient Bayesian Optimization algorithm to automatically search for the best policy, which substantially improves the generalization capability of models. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that TAA boosts classification accuracy in low-resource and class-imbalanced regimes by an average of 8.8% and 9.7%, respectively, outperforming strong baselines.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have expanded possibilities to generate music, but generating a customizable full piece of music with consistent long-term structure remains a challenge. This paper introduces MusicFrameworks, a hierarchical music structure representation and a multi-step generative process to create a full-length melody guided by long-term repetitive structure, chord, melodic contour, and rhythm constraints. We first organize the full melody with section and phrase-level structure. To generate melody in each phrase, we generate rhythm and basic melody using two separate transformer-based networks, and then generate the melody conditioned on the basic melody, rhythm and chords in an auto-regressive manner. By factoring music generation into sub-problems, our approach allows simpler models and requires less data. To customize or add variety, one can alter chords, basic melody, and rhythm structure in the music frameworks, letting our networks generate the melody accordingly. Additionally, we introduce new features to encode musical positional information, rhythm patterns, and melodic contours based on musical domain knowledge. A listening test reveals that melodies generated by our method are rated as good as or better than human-composed music in the POP909 dataset about half the time.

**Abstract:** The longitudinal modeling of neuroanatomical changes related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for studying the progression of the disease. To this end, we introduce TransforMesh, a spatio-temporal network based on transformers that models longitudinal shape changes on 3D anatomical meshes. While transformer and mesh networks have recently shown impressive performances in natural language processing and computer vision, their application to medical image analysis has been very limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that combines transformer and mesh networks. Our results show that TransforMesh can model shape trajectories better than other baseline architectures that do not capture temporal dependencies. Moreover, we also explore the capabilities of TransforMesh in detecting structural anomalies of the hippocampus in patients developing AD.

**Abstract:** Recent multilingual pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable zero-shot performance, where the model is only finetuned on one source language and directly evaluated on target languages. In this work, we propose a self-learning framework that further utilizes unlabeled data of target languages, combined with uncertainty estimation in the process to select high-quality silver labels. Three different uncertainties are adapted and analyzed specifically for the cross lingual transfer: Language Heteroscedastic/Homoscedastic Uncertainty (LEU/LOU), Evidential Uncertainty (EVI). We evaluate our framework with uncertainties on two cross-lingual tasks including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) covering 40 languages in total, which outperforms the baselines significantly by 10 F1 on average for NER and 2.5 accuracy score for NLI.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a human-in-the-loop (HITL) data annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, large-scale speech datasets. The pipeline combines human and machine advantages to more quickly, accurately, and cost-effectively annotate datasets with machine pre-labeling and fully manual auditing. Quality control mechanisms such as blind testing, behavior monitoring, and data validation have been adopted in the annotation pipeline to mitigate potential bias introduced by machine-generated labels. Our A/B testing and pilot results demonstrated the HITL pipeline can improve annotation speed and capacity by at least 80% and quality is comparable to or higher than manual double pass annotation. We are leveraging this scalable pipeline to create and continuously grow ultra-high volume off-the-shelf (UHV-OTS) speech corpora for multiple languages, with the capability to expand to 10,000+ hours per language annually. Customized datasets can be produced from the UHV-OTS corpora using dynamic packaging. UHV-OTS is a long-term Appen project to support commercial and academic research data needs in speech processing. Appen will donate a number of free speech datasets from the UHV-OTS each year to support academic and open source community research under the CC-BY-SA license. We are also releasing the code of the data pre-processing and pre-tagging pipeline under the Apache 2.0 license to allow reproduction of the results reported in the paper.

**Abstract:** Web search is fundamentally multimodal and multihop. Often, even before asking a question we choose to go directly to image search to find our answers. Further, rarely do we find an answer from a single source but aggregate information and reason through implications. Despite the frequency of this everyday occurrence, at present, there is no unified question answering benchmark that requires a single model to answer long-form natural language questions from text and open-ended visual sources -- akin to a human's experience. We propose to bridge this gap between the natural language and computer vision communities with WebQA. We show that A. our multihop text queries are difficult for a large-scale transformer model, and B. existing multi-modal transformers and visual representations do not perform well on open-domain visual queries. Our challenge for the community is to create a unified multimodal reasoning model that seamlessly transitions and reasons regardless of the source modality.

**Abstract:** Recent advance in classical reinforcement learning (RL) and quantum computation (QC) points to a promising direction of performing RL on a quantum computer. However, potential applications in quantum RL are limited by the number of qubits available in the modern quantum devices. Here we present two frameworks of deep quantum RL tasks using a gradient-free evolution optimization: First, we apply the amplitude encoding scheme to the Cart-Pole problem; Second, we propose a hybrid framework where the quantum RL agents are equipped with hybrid tensor network-variational quantum circuit (TN-VQC) architecture to handle inputs with dimensions exceeding the number of qubits. This allows us to perform quantum RL on the MiniGrid environment with 147-dimensional inputs. We demonstrate the quantum advantage of parameter saving using the amplitude encoding. The hybrid TN-VQC architecture provides a natural way to perform efficient compression of the input dimension, enabling further quantum RL applications on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

**Abstract:** One of the most challenging goals in designing intelligent systems is empowering them with the ability to synthesize programs from data. Namely, given specific requirements in the form of input/output pairs, the goal is to train a machine learning model to discover a program that satisfies those requirements. A recent class of methods exploits combinatorial search procedures and deep learning to learn compositional programs. However, they usually generate only toy programs using a domain-specific language that does not provide any high-level feature, such as function arguments, which reduces their applicability in real-world settings. We extend upon a state of the art model, AlphaNPI, by learning to generate functions that can accept arguments. This improvement will enable us to move closer to real computer programs. Moreover, we investigate employing an Approximate version of Monte Carlo Tree Search (A-MCTS) to speed up convergence. We showcase the potential of our approach by learning the Quicksort algorithm, showing how the ability to deal with arguments is crucial for learning and generalization.

**Abstract:** Adversarial training, a method for learning robust deep neural networks, constructs adversarial examples during training. However, recent methods for generating NLP adversarial examples involve combinatorial search and expensive sentence encoders for constraining the generated instances. As a result, it remains challenging to use vanilla adversarial training to improve NLP models' performance, and the benefits are mainly uninvestigated. This paper proposes a simple and improved vanilla adversarial training process for NLP models, which we name Attacking to Training (A2T). The core part of A2T is a new and cheaper word substitution attack optimized for vanilla adversarial training. We use A2T to train BERT and RoBERTa models on IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp, and SNLI datasets. Our results empirically show that it is possible to train robust NLP models using a much cheaper adversary. We demonstrate that vanilla adversarial training with A2T can improve an NLP model's robustness to the attack it was originally trained with and also defend the model against other types of word substitution attacks. Furthermore, we show that A2T can improve NLP models' standard accuracy, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. Code is available at https://github.com/QData/Textattack-A2T .

This paper proposes a new pre-training task called that can improve performance of layout-aware word embeddings that incorporate 2-D position embeddings. We compare models pre-trained with only language masking against models pre-trained with both language masking and position masking, and we find that position masking improves performance by over 5% on a form understanding task.

**Abstract:** In multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the performance of a model highly depends on the quality of synthesized embeddings. These embeddings are generated from the upstream process called multimodal fusion, which aims to extract and combine the input unimodal raw data to produce a richer multimodal representation. Previous work either back-propagates the task loss or manipulates the geometric property of feature spaces to produce favorable fusion results, which neglects the preservation of critical task-related information that flows from input to the fusion results. In this work, we propose a framework named MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM), which hierarchically maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) in unimodal input pairs (inter-modality) and between multimodal fusion result and unimodal input in order to maintain task-related information through multimodal fusion. The framework is jointly trained with the main task (MSA) to improve the performance of the downstream MSA task. To address the intractable issue of MI bounds, we further formulate a set of computationally simple parametric and non-parametric methods to approximate their truth value. Experimental results on the two widely used datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The implementation of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/declare-lab/Multimodal-Infomax.

**Abstract:** A backdoor data poisoning attack is an adversarial attack wherein the attacker injects several watermarked, mislabeled training examples into a training set. The watermark does not impact the test-time performance of the model on typical data; however, the model reliably errs on watermarked examples.
  To gain a better foundational understanding of backdoor data poisoning attacks, we present a formal theoretical framework within which one can discuss backdoor data poisoning attacks for classification problems. We then use this to analyze important statistical and computational issues surrounding these attacks.
  On the statistical front, we identify a parameter we call the memorization capacity that captures the intrinsic vulnerability of a learning problem to a backdoor attack. This allows us to argue about the robustness of several natural learning problems to backdoor attacks. Our results favoring the attacker involve presenting explicit constructions of backdoor attacks, and our robustness results show that some natural problem settings cannot yield successful backdoor attacks.
  From a computational standpoint, we show that under certain assumptions, adversarial training can detect the presence of backdoors in a training set. We then show that under similar assumptions, two closely related problems we call backdoor filtering and robust generalization are nearly equivalent. This implies that it is both asymptotically necessary and sufficient to design algorithms that can identify watermarked examples in the training set in order to obtain a learning algorithm that both generalizes well to unseen data and is robust to backdoors.

**Abstract:** As an effective way to integrate the information contained in multiple medical images under different modalities, medical image synthesis and fusion have emerged in various clinical applications such as disease diagnosis and treatment planning. In this paper, an invertible and variable augmented network (iVAN) is proposed for medical image synthesis and fusion. In iVAN, the channel number of the network input and output is the same through variable augmentation technology, and data relevance is enhanced, which is conducive to the generation of characterization information. Meanwhile, the invertible network is used to achieve the bidirectional inference processes. Due to the invertible and variable augmentation schemes, iVAN can not only be applied to the mappings of multi-input to one-output and multi-input to multi-output, but also be applied to one-input to multi-output. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain competitive or superior performance in comparison to representative medical image synthesis and fusion methods.

**Abstract:** The strong relation between face and voice can aid active speaker detection systems when faces are visible, even in difficult settings, when the face of a speaker is not clear or when there are several people in the same scene. By being capable of estimating the frontal facial representation of a person from his/her speech, it becomes easier to determine whether he/she is a potential candidate for being classified as an active speaker, even in challenging cases in which no mouth movement is detected from any person in that same scene. By incorporating a face-voice association neural network into an existing state-of-the-art active speaker detection model, we introduce FaVoA (Face-Voice Association Ambiguous Speaker Detector), a neural network model that can correctly classify particularly ambiguous scenarios. FaVoA not only finds positive associations, but helps to rule out non-matching face-voice associations, where a face does not match a voice. Its use of a gated-bimodal-unit architecture for the fusion of those models offers a way to quantitatively determine how much each modality contributes to the classification.

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are now being widely used for classifying and detecting pulmonary abnormalities in chest radiographs. Two complementary generalization properties of CNNs, translation invariance and equivariance, are particularly useful in detecting manifested abnormalities associated with pulmonary disease, regardless of their spatial locations within the image. However, these properties also come with the loss of exact spatial information and global relative positions of abnormalities detected in local regions. Global relative positions of such abnormalities may help distinguish similar conditions, such as COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. In such instances, a global attention mechanism is needed, which CNNs do not support in their traditional architectures that aim for generalization afforded by translation invariance and equivariance. Vision Transformers provide a global attention mechanism, but lack translation invariance and equivariance, requiring significantly more training data samples to match generalization of CNNs. To address the loss of spatial information and global relations between features, while preserving the inductive biases of CNNs, we present a novel technique that serves as an auxiliary attention mechanism to existing CNN architectures, in order to extract global correlations between salient features.

**Abstract:** This paper is devoted to establishing $L^2$ approximation properties for deep ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on two-dimensional space. The analysis is based on a decomposition theorem for convolutional kernels with large spatial size and multi-channel. Given that decomposition and the property of the ReLU activation function, a universal approximation theorem of deep ReLU CNNs with classic structure is obtained by showing its connection with ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) with one hidden layer. Furthermore, approximation properties are also obtained for neural networks with ResNet, pre-act ResNet, and MgNet architecture based on connections between these networks.

**Abstract:** While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has received tremendous attentions in many machine learning tasks due to its successful use of unlabeled data, existing SSL algorithms use either all unlabeled examples or the unlabeled examples with a fixed high-confidence prediction during the training progress. However, it is possible that too many correct/wrong pseudo labeled examples are eliminated/selected. In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework, whose key idea is to select a subset of training examples from the unlabeled data when performing existing SSL methods so that only the unlabeled examples with pseudo labels related to the labeled data will be used to train models. The selection is performed at each updating iteration by only keeping the examples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that is dynamically adjusted through the iteration. Our proposed approach, Dash, enjoys its adaptivity in terms of unlabeled data selection and its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we theoretically establish the convergence rate of Dash from the view of non-convex optimization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art over benchmarks.

**Abstract:** We give an $n^{O(\log\log n)}$-time membership query algorithm for properly and agnostically learning decision trees under the uniform distribution over $\{\pm 1\}^n$. Even in the realizable setting, the previous fastest runtime was $n^{O(\log n)}$, a consequence of a classic algorithm of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler. Our algorithm shares similarities with practical heuristics for learning decision trees, which we augment with additional ideas to circumvent known lower bounds against these heuristics. To analyze our algorithm, we prove a new structural result for decision trees that strengthens a theorem of O'Donnell, Saks, Schramm, and Servedio. While the OSSS theorem says that every decision tree has an influential variable, we show how every decision tree can be "pruned" so that every variable in the resulting tree is influential.

**Abstract:** Automatic hate speech detection is hampered by the scarcity of labeled datasetd, leading to poor generalization. We employ pretrained language models (LMs) to alleviate this data bottleneck. We utilize the GPT LM for generating large amounts of synthetic hate speech sequences from available labeled examples, and leverage the generated data in fine-tuning large pretrained LMs on hate detection. An empirical study using the models of BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT, shows that this approach improves generalization significantly and consistently within and across data distributions. In fact, we find that generating relevant labeled hate speech sequences is preferable to using out-of-domain, and sometimes also within-domain, human-labeled examples.

**Abstract:** Let $\mathbf{X} = (X_i)_{1\leq i \leq n}$ be an i.i.d. sample of square-integrable variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$, \GB{with common expectation $Œº$ and covariance matrix $Œ£$, both unknown.} We consider the problem of testing if $Œº$ is $Œ∑$-close to zero, i.e. $\|Œº\| \leq Œ∑$ against $\|Œº\| \geq (Œ∑+ Œ¥)$; we also tackle the more general two-sample mean closeness (also known as {\em relevant difference}) testing problem. The aim of this paper is to obtain nonasymptotic upper and lower bounds on the minimal separation distance  $Œ¥$ such that we can control both the Type I and Type II errors  at a given level. The main technical tools are concentration inequalities, first for  a suitable estimator of $\|Œº\|^2$ used a test statistic, and secondly for estimating the operator and Frobenius norms of  $Œ£$ coming into the quantiles of said test statistic. These properties are obtained for Gaussian and bounded distributions. A particular attention is given to the dependence in the pseudo-dimension $d_*$ of the distribution,  defined as $d_* := \|Œ£\|_2^2/\|Œ£\|_\infty^2$. In particular, for $Œ∑=0$, the minimum  separation distance is $Œò( d_*^{\frac{1}{4}}\sqrt{\|Œ£\|_\infty/n})$, in  contrast with the minimax estimation distance for $Œº$, which is  $Œò(d_e^{\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{\|Œ£\|_\infty/n})$ (where $d_e:=\|Œ£\|_1/\|Œ£\|_\infty$). This generalizes  a phenomenon spelled out in particular by Baraud (2002).

**Abstract:** With the increasing reliance on automated decision making, the issue of algorithmic fairness has gained increasing importance. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network for tabular data generation. The model includes two phases of training. In the first phase, the model is trained to accurately generate synthetic data similar to the reference dataset. In the second phase we modify the value function to add fairness constraint, and continue training the network to generate data that is both accurate and fair. We test our results in both cases of unconstrained, and constrained fair data generation. In the unconstrained case, i.e. when the model is only trained in the first phase and is only meant to generate accurate data following the same joint probability distribution of the real data, the results show that the model beats state-of-the-art GANs proposed in the literature to produce synthetic tabular data. Also, in the constrained case in which the first phase of training is followed by the second phase, we train the network and test it on four datasets studied in the fairness literature and compare our results with another state-of-the-art pre-processing method, and present the promising results that it achieves. Comparing to other studies utilizing GANs for fair data generation, our model is comparably more stable by using only one critic, and also by avoiding major problems of original GAN model, such as mode-dropping and non-convergence, by implementing a Wasserstein GAN.

**Abstract:** Many segmentation tasks for biomedical images can be modeled as the minimization of an energy function and solved by a class of max-flow and min-cut optimization algorithms. However, the segmentation accuracy is sensitive to the contrasting of semantic features of different segmenting objects, as the traditional energy function usually uses hand-crafted features in their energy functions. To address these limitations, we propose to incorporate end-to-end trainable neural network features into the energy functions. Our deep neural network features are extracted from the down-sampling and up-sampling layers with skip-connections of a U-net. In the inference stage, the learned features are fed into the energy functions. And the segmentations are solved in a primal-dual form by ADMM solvers. In the training stage, we train our neural networks by optimizing the energy function in the primal form with regularizations on the min-cut and flow-conservation functions, which are derived from the optimal conditions in the dual form. We evaluate our methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a brain tumor segmentation task. As the energy minimization model achieves a balance on sensitivity and smooth boundaries, we would show how our segmentation contours evolve actively through iterations as ensemble references for doctor diagnosis.

**Abstract:** Outcome labeling ambiguity and subjectivity are ubiquitous in real-world datasets. While practitioners commonly combine ambiguous outcome labels in an ad hoc way to improve the accuracy of multi-class classification, there lacks a principled approach to guide label combination by any optimality criterion. To address this problem, we propose the information-theoretic classification accuracy (ITCA), a criterion of outcome "information" conditional on outcome prediction, to guide practitioners on how to combine ambiguous outcome labels. ITCA indicates a balance in the trade-off between prediction accuracy (how well do predicted labels agree with actual labels) and prediction resolution (how many labels are predictable). To find the optimal label combination indicated by ITCA, we develop two search strategies: greedy search and breadth-first search. Notably, ITCA and the two search strategies are adaptive to all machine-learning classification algorithms. Coupled with a classification algorithm and a search strategy, ITCA has two uses: to improve prediction accuracy and to identify ambiguous labels. We first verify that ITCA achieves high accuracy with both search strategies in finding the correct label combinations on synthetic and real data. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of ITCA in diverse applications including medical prognosis, cancer survival prediction, user demographics prediction, and cell type classification.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning algorithm called \textit{under-bagging $k$-nearest neighbors} (\textit{under-bagging $k$-NN}) for imbalanced classification problems. On the theoretical side, by developing a new learning theory analysis, we show that with properly chosen parameters, i.e., the number of nearest neighbors $k$, the expected sub-sample size $s$, and the bagging rounds $B$, optimal convergence rates for under-bagging $k$-NN can be achieved under mild assumptions w.r.t.~the arithmetic mean (AM) of recalls. Moreover, we show that with a relatively small $B$, the expected sub-sample size $s$ can be much smaller than the number of training data $n$ at each bagging round, and the number of nearest neighbors $k$ can be reduced simultaneously, especially when the data are highly imbalanced, which leads to substantially lower time complexity and roughly the same space complexity. On the practical side, we conduct numerical experiments to verify the theoretical results on the benefits of the under-bagging technique by the promising AM performance and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

**Abstract:** Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) are an extremely popular method for training generative models to produce high quality synthetic data. While WGAN-GP were initially developed to calculate the Wasserstein 1 distance between generated and real data, recent works (e.g. Stanczuk et al. (2021)) have provided empirical evidence that this does not occur, and have argued that WGAN-GP perform well not in spite of this issue, but because of it. In this paper we show for the first time that WGAN-GP compute the minimum of a different optimal transport problem, the so-called congested transport (Carlier et al. (2008)). Congested transport determines the cost of moving one distribution to another under a transport model that penalizes congestion. For WGAN-GP, we find that the congestion penalty has a spatially varying component determined by the sampling strategy used in Gulrajani et al. (2017) which acts like a local speed limit, making congestion cost less in some regions than others. This aspect of the congested transport problem is new in that the congestion penalty turns out to be unbounded and depend on the distributions to be transported, and so we provide the necessary mathematical proofs for this setting. We use our discovery to show that the gradients of solutions to the optimization problem in WGAN-GP determine the time averaged momentum of optimal mass flow. This is in contrast to the gradients of Kantorovich potentials for the Wasserstein 1 distance, which only determine the normalized direction of flow. This may explain, in support of Stanczuk et al. (2021), the success of WGAN-GP, since the training of the generator is based on these gradients.

**Abstract:** When manipulating objects, humans finely adapt their motions to the characteristics of what they are handling. Thus, an attentive observer can foresee hidden properties of the manipulated object, such as its weight, temperature, and even whether it requires special care in manipulation. This study is a step towards endowing a humanoid robot with this last capability. Specifically, we study how a robot can infer online, from vision alone, whether or not the human partner is careful when moving an object. We demonstrated that a humanoid robot could perform this inference with high accuracy (up to 81.3%) even with a low-resolution camera. Only for short movements without obstacles, carefulness recognition was insufficient. The prompt recognition of movement carefulness from observing the partner's action will allow robots to adapt their actions on the object to show the same degree of care as their human partners.

**Abstract:** Although rare diseases are characterized by low prevalence, approximately 300 million people are affected by a rare disease. The early and accurate diagnosis of these conditions is a major challenge for general practitioners, who do not have enough knowledge to identify them. In addition to this, rare diseases usually show a wide variety of manifestations, which might make the diagnosis even more difficult. A delayed diagnosis can negatively affect the patient's life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the scientific and medical knowledge about rare diseases. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning can help to extract relevant information about rare diseases to facilitate their diagnosis and treatments. The paper explores the use of several deep learning techniques such as Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks or deep contextualized word representations based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to recognize rare diseases and their clinical manifestations (signs and symptoms) in the RareDis corpus. This corpus contains more than 5,000 rare diseases and almost 6,000 clinical manifestations. BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation based on BERT and trained on biomedical corpora, obtains the best results. In particular, this model obtains an F1-score of 85.2% for rare diseases, outperforming all the other models.

**Abstract:** Extracting aspect-polarity pairs from texts is an important task of fine-grained sentiment analysis. While the existing approaches to this task have gained many progresses, they are limited at capturing relationships among aspect-polarity pairs in a text, thus degrading the extraction performance. Moreover, the existing state-of-the-art approaches, namely token-based se-quence tagging and span-based classification, have their own defects such as polarity inconsistency resulted from separately tagging tokens in the former and the heterogeneous categorization in the latter where aspect-related and polarity-related labels are mixed. In order to remedy the above defects, in-spiring from the recent advancements in relation extraction, we propose to generate aspect-polarity pairs directly from a text with relation extraction technology, regarding aspect-pairs as unary relations where aspects are enti-ties and the corresponding polarities are relations. Based on the perspective, we present a position- and aspect-aware sequence2sequence model for joint extraction of aspect-polarity pairs. The model is characterized with its ability to capture not only relationships among aspect-polarity pairs in a text through the sequence decoding, but also correlations between an aspect and its polarity through the position- and aspect-aware attentions. The experi-ments performed on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches, making significant im-provement over them.

**Abstract:** Automating sign language translation (SLT) is a challenging real world application. Despite its societal importance, though, research progress in the field remains rather poor. Crucially, existing methods that yield viable performance necessitate the availability of laborious to obtain gloss sequence groundtruth. In this paper, we attenuate this need, by introducing an end-to-end SLT model that does not entail explicit use of glosses; the model only needs text groundtruth. This is in stark contrast to existing end-to-end models that use gloss sequence groundtruth, either in the form of a modality that is recognized at an intermediate model stage, or in the form of a parallel output process, jointly trained with the SLT model. Our approach constitutes a Transformer network with a novel type of layers that combines: (i) local winner-takes-all (LWTA) layers with stochastic winner sampling, instead of conventional ReLU layers, (ii) stochastic weights with posterior distributions estimated via variational inference, and (iii) a weight compression technique at inference time that exploits estimated posterior variance to perform massive, almost lossless compression. We demonstrate that our approach can reach the currently best reported BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX 2014T benchmark, but without making use of glosses for model training, and with a memory footprint reduced by more than 70%.

**Abstract:** An optical neural network (ONN) is a promising system due to its high-speed and low-power operation. Its linear unit performs a multiplication of an input vector and a weight matrix in optical analog circuits. Among them, a circuit with a multiple-layered structure of programmable Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) can realize a specific class of unitary matrices with a limited number of MZIs as its weight matrix. The circuit is effective for balancing the number of programmable MZIs and ONN performance. However, it takes a lot of time to learn MZI parameters of the circuit with a conventional automatic differentiation (AD), which machine learning platforms are equipped with. To solve the time-consuming problem, we propose an acceleration method for learning MZI parameters. We create customized complex-valued derivatives for an MZI, exploiting Wirtinger derivatives and a chain rule. They are incorporated into our newly developed function module implemented in C++ to collectively calculate their values in a multi-layered structure. Our method is simple, fast, and versatile as well as compatible with the conventional AD. We demonstrate that our method works 20 times faster than the conventional AD when a pixel-by-pixel MNIST task is performed in a complex-valued recurrent neural network with an MZI-based hidden unit.

**Abstract:** Data normalization is one of the most important preprocessing steps when building a machine learning model, especially when the model of interest is a deep neural network. This is because deep neural network optimized with stochastic gradient descent is sensitive to the input variable range and prone to numerical issues. Different than other types of signals, financial time-series often exhibit unique characteristics such as high volatility, non-stationarity and multi-modality that make them challenging to work with, often requiring expert domain knowledge for devising a suitable processing pipeline. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven normalization method for deep neural networks that handle high-frequency financial time-series. The proposed normalization scheme, which takes into account the bimodal characteristic of financial multivariate time-series, requires no expert knowledge to preprocess a financial time-series since this step is formulated as part of the end-to-end optimization process. Our experiments, conducted with state-of-the-arts neural networks and high-frequency data from two large-scale limit order books coming from the Nordic and US markets, show significant improvements over other normalization techniques in forecasting future stock price dynamics.

**Abstract:** We revisit the problem of fair clustering, first introduced by Chierichetti et al., that requires each protected attribute to have approximately equal representation in every cluster; i.e., a balance property. Existing solutions to fair clustering are either not scalable or do not achieve an optimal trade-off between clustering objective and fairness. In this paper, we propose a new notion of fairness, which we call $tau$-fair fairness, that strictly generalizes the balance property and enables a fine-grained efficiency vs. fairness trade-off. Furthermore, we show that simple greedy round-robin based algorithms achieve this trade-off efficiently. Under a more general setting of multi-valued protected attributes, we rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of the our algorithms. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed solution outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms and works exceptionally well even for a large number of clusters.

**Abstract:** The explosive increase of multimodal data makes a great demand in many cross-modal applications that follow the strict prior related assumption. Thus researchers study the definition of cross-modal correlation category and construct various classification systems and predictive models. However, those systems pay more attention to the fine-grained relevant types of cross-modal correlation, ignoring lots of implicit relevant data which are often divided into irrelevant types. What's worse is that none of previous predictive models manifest the essence of cross-modal correlation according to their definition at the modeling stage. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the image-text correlation and redefine a new classification system based on implicit association and explicit alignment. To predict the type of image-text correlation, we propose the Association and Alignment Network according to our proposed definition (namely AnANet) which implicitly represents the global discrepancy and commonality between image and text and explicitly captures the cross-modal local relevance. The experimental results on our constructed new image-text correlation dataset show the effectiveness of our model.

**Abstract:** Adversarial training (AT) has been demonstrated as one of the most promising defense methods against various adversarial attacks. To our knowledge, existing AT-based methods usually train with the locally most adversarial perturbed points and treat all the perturbed points equally, which may lead to considerably weaker adversarial robust generalization on test data. In this work, we introduce a new adversarial training framework that considers the diversity as well as characteristics of the perturbed points in the vicinity of benign samples. To realize the framework, we propose a Regional Adversarial Training (RAT) defense method that first utilizes the attack path generated by the typical iterative attack method of projected gradient descent (PGD), and constructs an adversarial region based on the attack path. Then, RAT samples diverse perturbed training points efficiently inside this region, and utilizes a distance-aware label smoothing mechanism to capture our intuition that perturbed points at different locations should have different impact on the model performance. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that RAT consistently makes significant improvement on standard adversarial training (SAT), and exhibits better robust generalization.

**Abstract:** Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a promising privacy-preserving technique for cross-silo federated learning (FL), where organizations perform collaborative model training on decentralized data. Despite the strong privacy guarantee, general HE schemes result in significant computation and communication overhead. Prior works employ batch encryption to address this problem, but it is still suboptimal in mitigating communication overhead and is incompatible with sparsification techniques.
  In this paper, we propose FLASHE, an HE scheme tailored for cross-silo FL. To capture the minimum requirements of security and functionality, FLASHE drops the asymmetric-key design and only involves modular addition operations with random numbers. Depending on whether to accommodate sparsification techniques, FLASHE is optimized in computation efficiency with different approaches. We have implemented FLASHE as a pluggable module atop FATE, an industrial platform for cross-silo FL. Compared to plaintext training, FLASHE slightly increases the training time by $\leq6\%$, with no communication overhead.

**Abstract:** Cough is a major symptom of respiratory-related diseases. There exists a tremendous amount of work in detecting coughs from audio but there has been no effort to identify coughs from solely inertial measurement unit (IMU). Coughing causes motion across the whole body and especially on the neck and head. Therefore, head motion data during coughing captured by a head-worn IMU sensor could be leveraged to detect coughs using a template matching algorithm. In time series template matching problems, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) combined with elastic distance measurement (esp. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)) achieves outstanding performance. However, it is often regarded as prohibitively time-consuming. Nearest Centroid Classifier is thereafter proposed. But the accuracy is comprised of only one centroid obtained for each class. Centroid-based Classifier performs clustering and averaging for each cluster, but requires manually setting the number of clusters. We propose a novel self-tuning multi-centroid template-matching algorithm, which can automatically adjust the number of clusters to balance accuracy and inference time. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and a real-world earbud-based cough dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm and present the result of cough detection with a single accelerometer sensor on the earbuds platform.

**Abstract:** Motivated by scenarios where data is used for diverse prediction tasks, we study whether fair representation can be used to guarantee fairness for unknown tasks and for multiple fairness notions simultaneously. We consider seven group fairness notions that cover the concepts of independence, separation, and calibration. Against the backdrop of the fairness impossibility results, we explore approximate fairness. We prove that, although fair representation might not guarantee fairness for all prediction tasks, it does guarantee fairness for an important subset of tasks -- the tasks for which the representation is discriminative. Specifically, all seven group fairness notions are linearly controlled by fairness and discriminativeness of the representation. When an incompatibility exists between different fairness notions, fair and discriminative representation hits the sweet spot that approximately satisfies all notions. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose to learn both fair and discriminative representations using pretext loss which self-supervises learning, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy as a fair regularizer. Experiments on tabular, image, and face datasets show that using the learned representation, downstream predictions that we are unaware of when learning the representation indeed become fairer for seven group fairness notions, and the fairness guarantees computed from our theoretical results are all valid.

**Abstract:** The Free Energy Principle (FEP) postulates that biological agents perceive and interact with their environment in order to minimize a Variational Free Energy (VFE) with respect to a generative model of their environment. The inference of a policy (future control sequence) according to the FEP is known as Active Inference (AIF). The AIF literature describes multiple VFE objectives for policy planning that lead to epistemic (information-seeking) behavior. However, most objectives have limited modeling flexibility. This paper approaches epistemic behavior from a constrained Bethe Free Energy (CBFE) perspective. Crucially, variational optimization of the CBFE can be expressed in terms of message passing on free-form generative models. The key intuition behind the CBFE is that we impose a point-mass constraint on predicted outcomes, which explicitly encodes the assumption that the agent will make observations in the future. We interpret the CBFE objective in terms of its constituent behavioral drives. We then illustrate resulting behavior of the CBFE by planning and interacting with a simulated T-maze environment. Simulations for the T-maze task illustrate how the CBFE agent exhibits an epistemic drive, and actively plans ahead to account for the impact of predicted outcomes. Compared to an EFE agent, the CBFE agent incurs expected reward in significantly more environmental scenarios. We conclude that CBFE optimization by message passing suggests a general mechanism for epistemic-aware AIF in free-form generative models.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a Spatial Robust Mixture Regression model to investigate the relationship between a response variable and a set of explanatory variables over the spatial domain, assuming that the relationships may exhibit complex spatially dynamic patterns that cannot be captured by constant regression coefficients. Our method integrates the robust finite mixture Gaussian regression model with spatial constraints, to simultaneously handle the spatial nonstationarity, local homogeneity, and outlier contaminations. Compared with existing spatial regression models, our proposed model assumes the existence a few distinct regression models that are estimated based on observations that exhibit similar response-predictor relationships. As such, the proposed model not only accounts for nonstationarity in the spatial trend, but also clusters observations into a few distinct and homogenous groups. This provides an advantage on interpretation with a few stationary sub-processes identified that capture the predominant relationships between response and predictor variables. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates robust procedures to handle contaminations from both regression outliers and spatial outliers. By doing so, we robustly segment the spatial domain into distinct local regions with similar regression coefficients, and sporadic locations that are purely outliers. Rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure has been designed to test the significance of such segmentation. Experimental results on many synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of our proposed method, compared with other robust finite mixture regression, spatial regression and spatial segmentation methods.

**Abstract:** For real-life nonlinear systems, the exact form of nonlinearity is often not known and the known governing equations are often based on certain assumptions and approximations. Such representation introduced model-form error into the system. In this paper, we propose a novel gray-box modeling approach that not only identifies the model-form error but also utilizes it to improve the predictive capability of the known but approximate governing equation. The primary idea is to treat the unknown model-form error as a residual force and estimate it using duel Bayesian filter based joint input-state estimation algorithms. For improving the predictive capability of the underlying physics, we first use machine learning algorithm to learn a mapping between the estimated state and the input (model-form error) and then introduce it into the governing equation as an additional term. This helps in improving the predictive capability of the governing physics and allows the model to generalize to unseen environment. Although in theory, any machine learning algorithm can be used within the proposed framework, we use Gaussian process in this work. To test the performance of proposed framework, case studies discussing four different dynamical systems are discussed; results for which indicate that the framework is applicable to a wide variety of systems and can produce reliable estimates of original system's states.

**Abstract:** ASVspoof 2021 is the forth edition in the series of bi-annual challenges which aim to promote the study of spoofing and the design of countermeasures to protect automatic speaker verification systems from manipulation. In addition to a continued focus upon logical and physical access tasks in which there are a number of advances compared to previous editions, ASVspoof 2021 introduces a new task involving deepfake speech detection. This paper describes all three tasks, the new databases for each of them, the evaluation metrics, four challenge baselines, the evaluation platform and a summary of challenge results. Despite the introduction of channel and compression variability which compound the difficulty, results for the logical access and deepfake tasks are close to those from previous ASVspoof editions. Results for the physical access task show the difficulty in detecting attacks in real, variable physical spaces. With ASVspoof 2021 being the first edition for which participants were not provided with any matched training or development data and with this reflecting real conditions in which the nature of spoofed and deepfake speech can never be predicated with confidence, the results are extremely encouraging and demonstrate the substantial progress made in the field in recent years.

**Abstract:** The powerful learning ability of deep neural networks enables reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn competent control policies directly from high-dimensional and continuous environments. In theory, to achieve stable performance, neural networks assume i.i.d. inputs, which unfortunately does no hold in the general RL paradigm where the training data is temporally correlated and non-stationary. This issue may lead to the phenomenon of "catastrophic interference" and the collapse in performance as later training is likely to overwrite and interfer with previously learned policies. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "context" into single-task RL and develop a novel scheme, termed as Context Division and Knowledge Distillation (CDaKD) driven RL, to divide all states experienced during training into a series of contexts. Its motivation is to mitigate the challenge of aforementioned catastrophic interference in deep RL, thereby improving the stability and plasticity of RL models. At the heart of CDaKD is a value function, parameterized by a neural network feature extractor shared across all contexts, and a set of output heads, each specializing on an individual context. In CDaKD, we exploit online clustering to achieve context division, and interference is further alleviated by a knowledge distillation regularization term on the output layers for learned contexts. In addition, to effectively obtain the context division in high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., image inputs), we perform clustering in the lower-dimensional representation space of a randomly initialized convolutional encoder, which is fixed throughout training. Our results show that, with various replay memory capacities, CDaKD can consistently improve the performance of existing RL algorithms on classic OpenAI Gym tasks and the more complex high-dimensional Atari tasks, incurring only moderate computational overhead.

**Abstract:** With the advent of media streaming, video action recognition has become progressively important for various applications, yet at the high expense of requiring large-scale data labelling. To overcome the problem of expensive data labelling, domain adaptation techniques have been proposed that transfers knowledge from fully labelled data (i.e., source domain) to unlabelled data (i.e., target domain). The majority of video domain adaptation algorithms are proposed for closed-set scenarios in which all the classes are shared among the domains. In this work, we propose an open-set video domain adaptation approach to mitigate the domain discrepancy between the source and target data, allowing the target data to contain additional classes that do not belong to the source domain. Different from previous works, which only focus on improving accuracy for shared classes, we aim to jointly enhance the alignment of shared classes and recognition of unknown samples. Towards this goal, class-conditional extreme value theory is applied to enhance the unknown recognition. Specifically, the entropy values of target samples are modelled as generalised extreme value distributions, which allows separating unknown samples lying in the tail of the distribution. To alleviate the negative transfer issue, weights computed by the distance from the sample entropy to the threshold are leveraged in adversarial learning in the sense that confident source and target samples are aligned, and unconfident samples are pushed away. The proposed method has been thoroughly evaluated on both small-scale and large-scale cross-domain video datasets and achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

**Abstract:** Established approaches to assuring safety-critical systems and software are difficult to apply to systems employing machine learning (ML). In many cases, ML is used on ill-defined problems, e.g. optimising sepsis treatment, where there is no clear, pre-defined specification against which to assess validity. This problem is exacerbated by the "opaque" nature of ML where the learnt model is not amenable to human scrutiny. Explainable AI methods have been proposed to tackle this issue by producing human-interpretable representations of ML models which can help users to gain confidence and build trust in the ML system. However, there is not much work explicitly investigating the role of explainability for safety assurance in the context of ML development. This paper identifies ways in which explainable AI methods can contribute to safety assurance of ML-based systems. It then uses a concrete ML-based clinical decision support system, concerning weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate how explainable AI methods can be employed to produce evidence to support safety assurance. The results are also represented in a safety argument to show where, and in what way, explainable AI methods can contribute to a safety case. Overall, we conclude that explainable AI methods have a valuable role in safety assurance of ML-based systems in healthcare but that they are not sufficient in themselves to assure safety.

**Abstract:** Current unsupervised anomaly localization approaches rely on generative models to learn the distribution of normal images, which is later used to identify potential anomalous regions derived from errors on the reconstructed images. However, a main limitation of nearly all prior literature is the need of employing anomalous images to set a class-specific threshold to locate the anomalies. This limits their usability in realistic scenarios, where only normal data is typically accessible. Despite this major drawback, only a handful of works have addressed this limitation, by integrating supervision on attention maps during training. In this work, we propose a novel formulation that does not require accessing images with abnormalities to define the threshold. Furthermore, and in contrast to very recent work, the proposed constraint is formulated in a more principled manner, leveraging well-known knowledge in constrained optimization. In particular, the equality constraint on the attention maps in prior work is replaced by an inequality constraint, which allows more flexibility. In addition, to address the limitations of penalty-based functions we employ an extension of the popular log-barrier methods to handle the constraint. Comprehensive experiments on the popular BRATS'19 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms relevant literature, establishing new state-of-the-art results for unsupervised lesion segmentation.

**Abstract:** Humanitarian challenges, including natural disasters, food insecurity, climate change, racial and gender violence, environmental crises, the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, human rights violations, and forced displacements, disproportionately impact vulnerable communities worldwide. According to UN OCHA, 235 million people will require humanitarian assistance in 2021 . Despite these growing perils, there remains a notable paucity of data science research to scientifically inform equitable public policy decisions for improving the livelihood of at-risk populations. Scattered data science efforts exist to address these challenges, but they remain isolated from practice and prone to algorithmic harms concerning lack of privacy, fairness, interpretability, accountability, transparency, and ethics. Biases in data-driven methods carry the risk of amplifying inequalities in high-stakes policy decisions that impact the livelihood of millions of people. Consequently, proclaimed benefits of data-driven innovations remain inaccessible to policymakers, practitioners, and marginalized communities at the core of humanitarian actions and global development. To help fill this gap, we propose the Data-driven Humanitarian Mapping Research Program, which focuses on developing novel data science methodologies that harness human-machine intelligence for high-stakes public policy and resilience planning.

**Abstract:** Medical dialogue systems (MDSs) aim to assist doctors and patients with a range of professional medical services, i.e., diagnosis, consultation, and treatment. However, one-stop MDS is still unexplored because: (1) no dataset has so large-scale dialogues contains both multiple medical services and fine-grained medical labels (i.e., intents, slots, values); (2) no model has addressed a MDS based on multiple-service conversations in a unified framework. In this work, we first build a Multiple-domain Multiple-service medical dialogue (M^2-MedDialog)dataset, which contains 1,557 conversations between doctors and patients, covering 276 types of diseases, 2,468 medical entities, and 3 specialties of medical services. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only medical dialogue dataset that includes both multiple medical services and fine-grained medical labels. Then, we formulate a one-stop MDS as a sequence-to-sequence generation problem. We unify a MDS with causal language modeling and conditional causal language modeling, respectively. Specifically, we employ several pretrained models (i.e., BERT-WWM, BERT-MED, GPT2, and MT5) and their variants to get benchmarks on M^2-MedDialog dataset. We also propose pseudo labeling and natural perturbation methods to expand M2-MedDialog dataset and enhance the state-of-the-art pretrained models. We demonstrate the results achieved by the benchmarks so far through extensive experiments on M2-MedDialog. We release the dataset, the code, as well as the evaluation scripts to facilitate future research in this important research direction.

**Abstract:** Attacking Neural Machine Translation models is an inherently combinatorial task on discrete sequences, solved with approximate heuristics. Most methods use the gradient to attack the model on each sample independently. Instead of mechanically applying the gradient, could we learn to produce meaningful adversarial attacks ? In contrast to existing approaches, we learn to attack a model by training an adversarial generator based on a language model. We propose the Masked Adversarial Generation (MAG) model, that learns to perturb the translation model throughout the training process. The experiments show that it improves the robustness of machine translation models, while being faster than competing methods.

**Abstract:** Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) is one of the most serious cardiovascular events characterized by a growing yearly incidence,and the severity of disease prognosis. Currently, computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been widely adopted for the diagnosis and prognosis of TBAD. Accurate segmentation of true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) in CTA are crucial for the precise quantification of anatomical features. However, existing works only focus on only TL and FL without considering FLT. In this paper, we propose ImageTBAD, the first 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) image dataset of TBAD with annotation of TL, FL, and FLT. The proposed dataset contains 100 TBAD CTA images, which is of decent size compared with existing medical imaging datasets. As FLT can appear almost anywhere along the aorta with irregular shapes, segmentation of FLT presents a wide class of segmentation problems where targets exist in a variety of positions with irregular shapes. We further propose a baseline method for automatic segmentation of TBAD. Results show that the baseline method can achieve comparable results with existing works on aorta and TL segmentation. However, the segmentation accuracy of FLT is only 52%, which leaves large room for improvement and also shows the challenge of our dataset. To facilitate further research on this challenging problem, our dataset and codes are released to the public.

**Abstract:** Since the federated learning, which makes AI learning possible without moving local data around, was introduced by google in 2017 it has been actively studied particularly in the field of medicine. In fact, the idea of machine learning in AI without collecting data from local clients is very attractive because data remain in local sites. However, federated learning techniques still have various open issues due to its own characteristics such as non identical distribution, client participation management, and vulnerable environments. In this presentation, the current issues to make federated learning flawlessly useful in the real world will be briefly overviewed. They are related to data/system heterogeneity, client management, traceability, and security. Also, we introduce the modularized federated learning framework, we currently develop, to experiment various techniques and protocols to find solutions for aforementioned issues. The framework will be open to public after development completes.

**Abstract:** Mitotic count is the most important morphological feature of breast cancer grading. Many deep learning-based methods have been proposed but suffer from domain shift. In this work, we construct a Fourier-based segmentation model for mitosis detection to address the problem. Swapping the low-frequency spectrum of source and target images is shown effective to alleviate the discrepancy between different scanners. Our Fourier-based segmentation method can achieve F1 with 0.7456 on the preliminary test set.

**Abstract:** Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide and is increasing in incidence, with over two million new cases now diagnosed each year. As part of diagnostic tumour grading, histopathologists manually count the number of dividing cells (mitotic figures) in a sample. Since the process is subjective and time-consuming, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been developed to automate the process, however these methods often perform poorly when applied to data from outside of the original (training) domain, i.e. they do not generalise well to variations in histological background, staining protocols, or scanner types. Style transfer, a form of domain adaptation, provides the means to transform images from different domains to a shared visual appearance and have been adopted in various applications to mitigate the issue of domain shift. In this paper we train two mitosis detection models and two style transfer methods and evaluate the usefulness of the latter for improving mitosis detection performance in images digitised using different scanners. We found that the best of these models, U-Net without style transfer, achieved an F1-score of 0.693 on the MIDOG 2021 preliminary test set.

**Abstract:** This is the third paper in a series in which we develop machine learning (ML) moment closure models for the radiative transfer equation (RTE). In our previous work \cite{huang2021gradient}, we proposed an approach to learn the gradient of the unclosed high order moment, which performs much better than learning the moment itself and the conventional $P_N$ closure. However, while the ML moment closure has better accuracy, it is not able to guarantee hyperbolicity and has issues with long time stability. In our second paper \cite{huang2021hyperbolic}, we identified a symmetrizer which leads to conditions that enforce that the gradient based ML closure is symmetrizable hyperbolic and stable over long time. The limitation of this approach is that in practice the highest moment can only be related to four, or fewer, lower moments.
  In this paper, we propose a new method to enforce the hyperbolicity of the ML closure model. Motivated by the observation that the coefficient matrix of the closure system is a lower Hessenberg matrix, we relate its eigenvalues to the roots of an associated polynomial. We design two new neural network architectures based on this relation. The ML closure model resulting from the first neural network is weakly hyperbolic and guarantees the physical characteristic speeds, i.e., the eigenvalues are bounded by the speed of light. The second model is strictly hyperbolic and does not guarantee the boundedness of the eigenvalues. Several benchmark tests including the Gaussian source problem and the two-material problem show the good accuracy, stability and generalizability of our hyperbolic ML closure model.

**Abstract:** A large body of literature has proved that the Bayesian optimization framework is especially efficient and effective in analog circuit synthesis. However, most of the previous research works only focus on designing informative surrogate models or efficient acquisition functions. Even if searching for the global optimum over the acquisition function surface is itself a difficult task, it has been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust Bayesian optimization approach via one-dimensional subspaces for analog circuit synthesis. By solely focusing on optimizing one-dimension subspaces at each iteration, we greatly reduce the computational overhead of the Bayesian optimization framework while safely maximizing the acquisition function. By combining the benefits of different dimension selection strategies, we adaptively balancing between searching globally and locally. By leveraging the batch Bayesian optimization framework, we further accelerate the optimization procedure by making full use of the hardware resources. Experimental results quantitatively show that our proposed algorithm can accelerate the optimization procedure by up to 9x and 38x compared to LP-EI and REMBOpBO respectively when the batch size is 15.

**Abstract:** In this thesis, I study the minimax oracle complexity of distributed stochastic optimization. First, I present the "graph oracle model", an extension of the classic oracle complexity framework that can be applied to study distributed optimization algorithms. Next, I describe a general approach to proving optimization lower bounds for arbitrary randomized algorithms (as opposed to more restricted classes of algorithms, e.g., deterministic or "zero-respecting" algorithms), which is used extensively throughout the thesis. For the remainder of the thesis, I focus on the specific case of the "intermittent communication setting", where multiple computing devices work in parallel with limited communication amongst themselves. In this setting, I analyze the theoretical properties of the popular Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm in convex setting, both for homogeneous and heterogeneous objectives. I provide the first guarantees for Local SGD that improve over simple baseline methods, but show that Local SGD is not optimal in general. In pursuit of optimal methods in the intermittent communication setting, I then show matching upper and lower bounds for the intermittent communication setting with homogeneous convex, heterogeneous convex, and homogeneous non-convex objectives. These upper bounds are attained by simple variants of SGD which are therefore optimal. Finally, I discuss several additional assumptions about the objective or more powerful oracles that might be exploitable in order to develop better intermittent communication algorithms with better guarantees than our lower bounds allow.

**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) aim at providing energy-efficient learning capabilities when implemented on neuromorphic chips with event-based Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). This paper studies the robustness of SNNs against adversarial attacks on such DVS-based systems, and proposes R-SNN, a novel methodology for robustifying SNNs through efficient DVS-noise filtering. We are the first to generate adversarial attacks on DVS signals (i.e., frames of events in the spatio-temporal domain) and to apply noise filters for DVS sensors in the quest for defending against adversarial attacks. Our results show that the noise filters effectively prevent the SNNs from being fooled. The SNNs in our experiments provide more than 90% accuracy on the DVS-Gesture and NMNIST datasets under different adversarial threat models.

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel gradient descent algorithm extending the well-known Gradient Sampling methodology to the class of stratifiably smooth objective functions, which are defined as locally Lipschitz functions that are smooth on some regular pieces-called the strata-of the ambient Euclidean space. For this class of functions, our algorithm achieves a sub-linear convergence rate. We then apply our method to objective functions based on the (extended) persistent homology map computed over lower-star filters, which is a central tool of Topological Data Analysis. For this, we propose an efficient exploration of the corresponding stratification by using the Cayley graph of the permutation group. Finally, we provide benchmark and novel topological optimization problems, in order to demonstrate the utility and applicability of our framework.

**Abstract:** Image fusion technology is widely used to fuse the complementary information between multi-source remote sensing images. Inspired by the frontier of deep learning, this paper first proposes a heterogeneous-integrated framework based on a novel deep residual cycle GAN. The proposed network consists of a forward fusion part and a backward degeneration feedback part. The forward part generates the desired fusion result from the various observations; the backward degeneration feedback part considers the imaging degradation process and regenerates the observations inversely from the fusion result. The proposed network can effectively fuse not only the homogeneous but also the heterogeneous information. In addition, for the first time, a heterogeneous-integrated fusion framework is proposed to simultaneously merge the complementary heterogeneous spatial, spectral and temporal information of multi-source heterogeneous observations. The proposed heterogeneous-integrated framework also provides a uniform mode that can complete various fusion tasks, including heterogeneous spatio-spectral fusion, spatio-temporal fusion, and heterogeneous spatio-spectral-temporal fusion. Experiments are conducted for two challenging scenarios of land cover changes and thick cloud coverage. Images from many remote sensing satellites, including MODIS, Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2, are utilized in the experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It includes issues of scope, platform, architecture and preparation of input data. It provides functionality in answering user queries and recording user information including contact details and case-related information. It utilises deep learning technology built upon Amazon Web Services (AWS) LEX in combination with AWS Lambda. Due to lack of publicly available data, we identified two methods including crowdsourcing experiments and archived enquiries to develop a number of linguistic resources. This includes a training dataset, set of predetermined responses for the conversational agent, a set of regression test cases and a further conversation test set. We propose a hierarchical bot structure that facilitates multi-level delegation and report model accuracy on the regression test set. Additionally, we highlight features that are added to the bot to improve the conversation flow and overall user experience.

**Abstract:** Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems have become popular in the past two decades due to their ability to "instantly" detect patterns on real-time streams of events. However, there is a lack of methods for forecasting when a pattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually detected by a CER engine. We present a formal framework that attempts to address the issue of Complex Event Forecasting (CEF). Our framework combines two formalisms: a) symbolic automata which are used to encode complex event patterns; and b) prediction suffix trees which can provide a succinct probabilistic description of an automaton's behavior. We compare our proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and show its advantage in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, prediction suffix trees, being variable-order Markov models, have the ability to capture long-term dependencies in a stream by remembering only those past sequences that are informative enough. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefits, in terms of accuracy, of being able to capture such long-term dependencies. This is achieved by increasing the order of our model beyond what is possible with full-order Markov models that need to perform an exhaustive enumeration of all possible past sequences of a given order. We also discuss extensively how CEF solutions should be best evaluated on the quality of their forecasts.

**Abstract:** Multi-objective symbolic regression has the advantage that while the accuracy of the learned models is maximized, the complexity is automatically adapted and need not be specified a-priori. The result of the optimization is not a single solution anymore, but a whole Pareto-front describing the trade-off between accuracy and complexity. In this contribution we study which complexity measures are most appropriately used in symbolic regression when performing multi- objective optimization with NSGA-II. Furthermore, we present a novel complexity measure that includes semantic information based on the function symbols occurring in the models and test its effects on several benchmark datasets. Results comparing multiple complexity measures are presented in terms of the achieved accuracy and model length to illustrate how the search direction of the algorithm is affected.

**Abstract:** The top-k recommendation is a fundamental task in recommendation systems which is generally learned by comparing positive and negative pairs. The Contrastive Loss (CL) is the key in contrastive learning that has received more attention recently and we find it is well suited for top-k recommendations. However, it is a problem that CL treats the importance of the positive and negative samples as the same. On the one hand, CL faces the imbalance problem of one positive sample and many negative samples. On the other hand, positive items are so few in sparser datasets that their importance should be emphasized. Moreover, the other important issue is that the sparse positive items are still not sufficiently utilized in recommendations. So we propose a new data augmentation method by using multiple positive items (or samples) simultaneously with the CL loss function. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Sample based Contrastive Loss (MSCL) function which solves the two problems by balancing the importance of positive and negative samples and data augmentation. And based on the graph convolution network (GCN) method, experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MSCL. The proposed MSCL is simple and can be applied in many methods. We will release our code on GitHub upon the acceptance.

**Abstract:** In this work, we focus on resource allocation in a decentralised open market. In decentralised open markets consists of multiple vendors and multiple dynamically-arriving buyers, thus makes the market complex and dynamic. Because, in these markets, negotiations among vendors and buyers take place over multiple conflicting issues such as price, scalability, robustness, delay, etc. As a result, optimising the resource allocation in such open markets becomes directly dependent on two key decisions, which are; incorporating a different kind of buyers' preferences, and fairness based vendor elicitation strategy. Towards this end, in this work, we propose a three-step resource allocation approach that employs a reverse-auction paradigm. At the first step, priority label is attached to each bidding vendor based on the proposed priority mechanism. Then, at the second step, the preference score is calculated for all the different kinds of preferences of the buyers. Finally, at the third step, based on the priority label of the vendor and the preference score winner is determined. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art resource pricing and allocation strategies. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the other two resource allocation approaches in terms of the independent utilities of buyers and the overall utility of the open market.

**Abstract:** In predictive tasks, real-world datasets often present different degrees of imbalanced (i.e., long-tailed or skewed) distributions. While the majority (the head) classes have sufficient samples, the minority (the tail) classes can be under-represented by a rather limited number of samples. Data pre-processing has been shown to be very effective in dealing with such problems. On one hand, data re-sampling is a common approach to tackling class imbalance. On the other hand, dimension reduction, which reduces the feature space, is a conventional technique for reducing noise and inconsistencies in a dataset. However, the possible synergy between feature selection and data re-sampling for high-performance imbalance classification has rarely been investigated before. To address this issue, we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the joint influence of feature selection and re-sampling on two-class imbalance classification. Specifically, we study the performance of two opposite pipelines for imbalance classification by applying feature selection before or after data re-sampling. We conduct a large number of experiments, with a total of 9225 tests, on 52 publicly available datasets, using 9 feature selection methods, 6 re-sampling approaches for class imbalance learning, and 3 well-known classification algorithms. Experimental results show that there is no constant winner between the two pipelines; thus both of them should be considered to derive the best performing model for imbalance classification. We find that the performance of an imbalance classification model not only depends on the classifier adopted and the ratio between the number of majority and minority samples, but also depends on the ratio between the number of samples and features. Overall, this study should provide new reference value for researchers and practitioners in imbalance learning.
