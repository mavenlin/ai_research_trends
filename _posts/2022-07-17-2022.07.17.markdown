**Abstract:** This paper introduces a system that learns to sing new tunes by listening to examples. It extracts sequencing rules from input music and uses these rules to generate new tunes, which are sung by a vocal synthesiser. We developed a method to represent rules for musical composition as quantum circuits. We claim that such musical rules are quantum native: they are naturally encodable in the amplitudes of quantum states. To evaluate a rule to generate a subsequent event, the system builds the respective quantum circuit dynamically and measures it. After a brief discussion about the vocal synthesis methods that we have been experimenting with, the paper introduces our novel generative music method through a practical example. The paper shows some experiments and concludes with a discussion about harnessing the creative potential of the system.

**Abstract:** Existing temporal action detection (TAD) methods rely on large training data including segment-level annotations, limited to recognizing previously seen classes alone during inference. Collecting and annotating a large training set for each class of interest is costly and hence unscalable. Zero-shot TAD (ZS-TAD) resolves this obstacle by enabling a pre-trained model to recognize any unseen action classes. Meanwhile, ZS-TAD is also much more challenging with significantly less investigation. Inspired by the success of zero-shot image classification aided by vision-language (ViL) models such as CLIP, we aim to tackle the more complex TAD task. An intuitive method is to integrate an off-the-shelf proposal detector with CLIP style classification. However, due to the sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, it is prone to localization error propagation. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a novel zero-Shot Temporal Action detection model via Vision-LanguagE prompting (STALE). Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by breaking the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and localization for improved optimization. Extensive experiments on standard ZS-TAD video benchmarks show that our STALE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives. Besides, our model also yields superior results on supervised TAD over recent strong competitors. The PyTorch implementation of STALE is available at https://github.com/sauradip/STALE.

**Abstract:** ImageNet trained PyTorch models are generally preferred as the off-the-shelf models for direct use or for initialisation in most computer vision tasks. In this paper, we simply test a representative set of these convolution and transformer based models under many simple image transformations like horizontal shifting, vertical shifting, scaling, rotation, presence of Gaussian noise, cutout, horizontal flip and vertical flip and report the performance drop caused by such transformations. We find that even simple transformations like rotating the image by 10Â° or zooming in by 20% can reduce the top-1 accuracy of models like ResNet152 by 1%+. The code is available at https://github.com/harshm121/imagenet-transformation-degradation.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a simple method for speech videos generation based on audio: given a piece of audio, we can generate a video of the target face speaking this audio. We propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with cut speech audio input as condition and use Convolutional Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) in generator and discriminator. Our model is trained by exploiting the short audio and the frames in this duration. For training, we cut the audio and extract the face in the corresponding frames. We designed a simple encoder and compare the generated frames using GAN with and without GRU. We use GRU for temporally coherent frames and the results show that short audio can produce relatively realistic output results.

**Abstract:** As a prevalent distributed learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) trains a global model on a massive amount of devices with infrequent communication. This paper investigates a class of composite optimization and statistical recovery problems in the FL setting, whose loss function consists of a data-dependent smooth loss and a non-smooth regularizer. Examples include sparse linear regression using Lasso, low-rank matrix recovery using nuclear norm regularization, etc. In the existing literature, federated composite optimization algorithms are designed only from an optimization perspective without any statistical guarantees. In addition, they do not consider commonly used (restricted) strong convexity in statistical recovery problems. We advance the frontiers of this problem from both optimization and statistical perspectives. From optimization upfront, we propose a new algorithm named \textit{Fast Federated Dual Averaging} for strongly convex and smooth loss and establish state-of-the-art iteration and communication complexity in the composite setting. In particular, we prove that it enjoys a fast rate, linear speedup, and reduced communication rounds. From statistical upfront, for restricted strongly convex and smooth loss, we design another algorithm, namely \textit{Multi-stage Federated Dual Averaging}, and prove a high probability complexity bound with linear speedup up to optimal statistical precision. Experiments in both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our methods perform better than other baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing fast optimization algorithms and statistical recovery guarantees for composite problems in FL.

**Abstract:** The ability to process environment maps across multiple sessions is critical for robots operating over extended periods of time. Specifically, it is desirable for autonomous agents to detect changes amongst maps of different sessions so as to gain a conflict-free understanding of the current environment. In this paper, we look into the problem of change detection based on a novel map representation, dubbed Plane Signed Distance Fields (PlaneSDF), where dense maps are represented as a collection of planes and their associated geometric components in SDF volumes. Given point clouds of the source and target scenes, we propose a three-step PlaneSDF-based change detection approach: (1) PlaneSDF volumes are instantiated within each scene and registered across scenes using plane poses; 2D height maps and object maps are extracted per volume via height projection and connected component analysis. (2) Height maps are compared and intersected with the object map to produce a 2D change location mask for changed object candidates in the source scene. (3) 3D geometric validation is performed using SDF-derived features per object candidate for change mask refinement. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via the task of changed object detection.

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel machine learning strategy, kernel addition Gaussian process regression (KA-GPR), in molecular-orbital-based machine learning (MOB-ML) to learn the total correlation energies of general electronic structure theories for closed- and open-shell systems by introducing a machine learning strategy. The learning efficiency of MOB-ML (KA-GPR) is the same as the original MOB-ML method for the smallest criegee molecule, which is a closed-shell molecule with multi-reference characters. In addition, the prediction accuracies of different small free radicals could reach the chemical accuracy of 1 kcal/mol by training on one example structure. Accurate potential energy surfaces for the H10 chain (closed-shell) and water OH bond dissociation (open-shell) could also be generated by MOB-ML (KA-GPR). To explore the breadth of chemical systems that KA-GPR can describe, we further apply MOB-ML to accurately predict the large benchmark datasets for closed- (QM9, QM7b-T, GDB-13-T) and open-shell (QMSpin) molecules.

**Abstract:** Providing invariances in a given learning task conveys a key inductive bias that can lead to sample-efficient learning and good generalisation, if correctly specified. However, the ideal invariances for many problems of interest are often not known, which has led both to a body of engineering lore as well as attempts to provide frameworks for invariance learning. However, invariance learning is expensive and data intensive for popular neural architectures. We introduce the notion of amortizing invariance learning. In an up-front learning phase, we learn a low-dimensional manifold of feature extractors spanning invariance to different transformations using a hyper-network. Then, for any problem of interest, both model and invariance learning are rapid and efficient by fitting a low-dimensional invariance descriptor an output head. Empirically, this framework can identify appropriate invariances in different downstream tasks and lead to comparable or better test performance than conventional approaches. Our HyperInvariance framework is also theoretically appealing as it enables generalisation-bounds that provide an interesting new operating point in the trade-off between model fit and complexity.

**Abstract:** Grounding dialogue system with external knowledge is a promising way to improve the quality of responses. Most existing works adopt knowledge graphs (KGs) as the external resources, paying attention to the contribution of entities in the last utterance of the dialogue for context understanding and response generation. Nevertheless, the correlations between knowledge implied in the multi-turn context and the transition regularities between relations in KGs are under-explored. To this end, we propose a Relation Transition aware Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation model (RT-KGD). Specifically, inspired by the latent logic of human conversation, our model integrates dialogue-level relation transition regularities with turn-level entity semantic information. In this manner, the interaction between knowledge is considered to produce abundant clues for predicting the appropriate knowledge and generating coherent responses. The experimental results on both automatic evaluation and manual evaluation indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims at predicting sentiment polarity (SC) or extracting opinion span (OE) expressed towards a given aspect. Previous work in ABSA mostly relies on rather complicated aspect-specific feature induction. Recently, pretrained language models (PLMs), e.g., BERT, have been used as context modeling layers to simplify the feature induction structures and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, such PLM-based context modeling can be not that aspect-specific. Therefore, a key question is left under-explored: how the aspect-specific context can be better modeled through PLMs? To answer the question, we attempt to enhance aspect-specific context modeling with PLM in a non-intrusive manner. We propose three aspect-specific input transformations, namely aspect companion, aspect prompt, and aspect marker. Informed by these transformations, non-intrusive aspect-specific PLMs can be achieved to promote the PLM to pay more attention to the aspect-specific context in a sentence. Additionally, we craft an adversarial benchmark for ABSA (advABSA) to see how aspect-specific modeling can impact model robustness. Extensive experimental results on standard and adversarial benchmarks for SC and OE demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, yielding new state-of-the-art performance on OE and competitive performance on SC.

**Abstract:** In supervised learning, the presence of noise can have a significant impact on decision making. Since many classifiers do not take label noise into account in the derivation of the loss function, including the loss functions of logistic regression, SVM, and AdaBoost, especially the AdaBoost iterative algorithm, whose core idea is to continuously increase the weight value of the misclassified samples, the weight of samples in many presence of label noise will be increased, leading to a decrease in model accuracy. In addition, the learning process of BP neural network and decision tree will also be affected by label noise. Therefore, solving the label noise problem is an important element of maintaining the robustness of the network model, which is of great practical significance. Granular ball computing is an important modeling method developed in the field of granular computing in recent years, which is an efficient, robust and scalable learning method. In this paper, we pioneered a granular ball neural network algorithm model, which adopts the idea of multi-granular to filter label noise samples during model training, solving the current problem of model instability caused by label noise in the field of deep learning, greatly reducing the proportion of label noise in training samples and improving the robustness of neural network models.

**Abstract:** Neural audio/speech coding has shown its capability to deliver a high quality at much lower bitrates than traditional methods recently. However, existing neural audio/speech codecs employ either acoustic features or learned blind features with a convolutional neural network for encoding, by which there are still temporal redundancies inside encoded features. This paper introduces latent-domain predictive coding into the VQ-VAE framework to fully remove such redundancies and proposes the TF-Codec for low-latency neural speech coding in an end-to-end way. Specifically, the extracted features are encoded conditioned on a prediction from past quantized latent frames so that temporal correlations are further removed. What's more, we introduce a learnable compression on the time-frequency input to adaptively adjust the attention paid on main frequencies and details at different bitrates. A differentiable vector quantization scheme based on distance-to-soft mapping and Gumbel-Softmax is proposed to better model the latent distributions with rate constraint. Subjective results on multilingual speech datasets show that with a latency of 40ms, the proposed TF-Codec at 1kbps can achieve a much better quality than Opus 9kbps and TF-Codec at 3kbps outperforms both EVS 9.6kbps and Opus 12kbps. Numerous studies are conducted to show the effectiveness of these techniques.

**Abstract:** Estimating the political leanings of social media users is a challenging and ever more pressing problem given the increase in social media consumption. We introduce Retweet-BERT, a simple and scalable model to estimate the political leanings of Twitter users. Retweet-BERT leverages the retweet network structure and the language used in users' profile descriptions. Our assumptions stem from patterns of networks and linguistics homophily among people who share similar ideologies. Retweet-BERT demonstrates competitive performance against other state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 96%-97% macro-F1 on two recent Twitter datasets (a COVID-19 dataset and a 2020 United States presidential elections dataset). We also perform manual validation to validate the performance of Retweet-BERT on users not in the training data. Finally, in a case study of COVID-19, we illustrate the presence of political echo chambers on Twitter and show that it exists primarily among right-leaning users. Our code is open-sourced and our data is publicly available.

**Abstract:** A person walking along a city street who tries to model all aspects of the world would quickly be overwhelmed by a multitude of shops, cars, and people moving in and out of view, following their own complex and inscrutable dynamics. Exploration and navigation in such an environment is an everyday task, requiring no vast exertion of mental resources. Is it possible to turn this fire hose of sensory information into a minimal latent state which is necessary and sufficient for an agent to successfully act in the world? We formulate this question concretely, and propose the Agent-Controllable State Discovery algorithm (AC-State), which has theoretical guarantees and is practically demonstrated to discover the \textit{minimal controllable latent state} which contains all of the information necessary for controlling the agent, while fully discarding all irrelevant information. This algorithm consists of a multi-step inverse model (predicting actions from distant observations) with an information bottleneck. AC-State enables localization, exploration, and navigation without reward or demonstrations. We demonstrate the discovery of controllable latent state in three domains: localizing a robot arm with distractions (e.g., changing lighting conditions and background), exploring in a maze alongside other agents, and navigating in the Matterport house simulator.

**Abstract:** As we move away from the data, the predictive uncertainty should increase, since a great variety of explanations are consistent with the little available information. We introduce Distance-Aware Prior (DAP) calibration, a method to correct overconfidence of Bayesian deep learning models outside of the training domain. We define DAPs as prior distributions over the model parameters that depend on the inputs through a measure of their distance from the training set. DAP calibration is agnostic to the posterior inference method, and it can be performed as a post-processing step. We demonstrate its effectiveness against several baselines in a variety of classification and regression problems, including benchmarks designed to test the quality of predictive distributions away from the data.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning is a new machine learning paradigm dealing with distributed model learning on independent devices. One of the many advantages of federated learning is that training data stay on devices (such as smartphones), and only learned models are shared with a centralized server. In the case of supervised learning, labeling is entrusted to the clients. However, acquiring such labels can be prohibitively expensive and error-prone for many tasks, such as human activity recognition. Hence, a wealth of data remains unlabelled and unexploited. Most existing federated learning approaches that focus mainly on supervised learning have mostly ignored this mass of unlabelled data. Furthermore, it is unclear whether standard federated Learning approaches are suited to self-supervised learning. The few studies that have dealt with the problem have limited themselves to the favorable situation of homogeneous datasets. This work lays the groundwork for a reference evaluation of federated Learning with Semi-Supervised Learning in a realistic setting. We show that standard lightweight autoencoder and standard Federated Averaging fail to learn a robust representation for Human Activity Recognition with several realistic heterogeneous datasets. These findings advocate for a more intensive research effort in Federated Self Supervised Learning to exploit the mass of heterogeneous unlabelled data present on mobile devices.

**Abstract:** Multimodal emotion recognition in conversations (mERC) is an active research topic in natural language processing (NLP), which aims to predict human's emotional states in communications of multiple modalities, e,g., natural language and facial gestures. Innumerable implicit prejudices and preconceptions fill human language and conversations, leading to the question of whether the current data-driven mERC approaches produce a biased error. For example, such approaches may offer higher emotional scores on the utterances by females than males. In addition, the existing debias models mainly focus on gender or race, where multibias mitigation is still an unexplored task in mERC. In this work, we take the first step to solve these issues by proposing a series of approaches to mitigate five typical kinds of bias in textual utterances (i.e., gender, age, race, religion and LGBTQ+) and visual representations (i.e, gender and age), followed by a Multibias-Mitigated and sentiment Knowledge Enriched bi-modal Transformer (MMKET). Comprehensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and prove that the debias operation has a great impact on the classification performance for mERC. We hope our study will benefit the development of bias mitigation in mERC and related emotion studies.

**Abstract:** Existing multimodal stress/pain recognition approaches generally extract features from different modalities independently and thus ignore cross-modality correlations. This paper proposes a novel geometric framework for multimodal stress/pain detection utilizing Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices as a representation that incorporates the correlation relationship of physiological and behavioural signals from covariance and cross-covariance. Considering the non-linearity of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, well-known machine learning techniques are not suited to classify these matrices. Therefore, a tangent space mapping method is adopted to map the derived SPD matrix sequences to the vector sequences in the tangent space where the LSTM-based network can be applied for classification. The proposed framework has been evaluated on two public multimodal datasets, achieving both the state-of-the-art results for stress and pain detection tasks.

**Abstract:** The rotation search problem aims to find a 3D rotation that best aligns a given number of point pairs. To induce robustness against outliers for rotation search, prior work considers truncated least-squares (TLS), which is a non-convex optimization problem, and its semidefinite relaxation (SDR) as a tractable alternative. Whether this SDR is theoretically tight in the presence of noise, outliers, or both has remained largely unexplored. We derive conditions that characterize the tightness of this SDR, showing that the tightness depends on the noise level, the truncation parameters of TLS, and the outlier distribution (random or clustered). In particular, we give a short proof for the tightness in the noiseless and outlier-free case, as opposed to the lengthy analysis of prior work.

**Abstract:** We propose a novel approach for planning agents to compose abstract skills via observing and learning from historical interactions with the world. Our framework operates in a Markov state-space model via a set of actions under unknown pre-conditions. We formulate skills as high-level abstract policies that propose action plans based on the current state. Each policy learns new plans by observing the states' transitions while the agent interacts with the world. Such an approach automatically learns new plans to achieve specific intended effects, but the success of such plans is often dependent on the states in which they are applicable. Therefore, we formulate the evaluation of such plans as infinitely many multi-armed bandit problems, where we balance the allocation of resources on evaluating the success probability of existing arms and exploring new options. The result is a planner capable of automatically learning robust high-level skills under a noisy environment; such skills implicitly learn the action pre-condition without explicit knowledge. We show that this planning approach is experimentally very competitive in high-dimensional state space domains.

**Abstract:** Admittedly, Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has achieved excellent results on graph datasets such as social networks, citation networks, etc. However, softmax used as the decision layer in these frameworks is generally optimized with thousands of iterations via gradient descent. Furthermore, due to ignoring the inner distribution of the graph nodes, the decision layer might lead to an unsatisfactory performance in semi-supervised learning with less label support. To address the referred issues, we propose a novel graph deep model with a non-gradient decision layer for graph mining. Firstly, manifold learning is unified with label local-structure preservation to capture the topological information of the nodes. Moreover, owing to the non-gradient property, closed-form solutions is achieved to be employed as the decision layer for GCN. Particularly, a joint optimization method is designed for this graph model, which extremely accelerates the convergence of the model. Finally, extensive experiments show that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance compared to the current models.

<p>

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning (CL) has recently been applied to adversarial learning tasks. Such practice considers adversarial samples as additional positive views of an instance, and by maximizing their agreements with each other, yields better adversarial robustness. However, this mechanism can be potentially flawed, since adversarial perturbations may cause instance-level identity confusion, which can impede CL performance by pulling together different instances with separate identities. To address this issue, we propose to treat adversarial samples unequally when contrasted, with an asymmetric InfoNCE objective ($A-InfoNCE$) that allows discriminating considerations of adversarial samples. Specifically, adversaries are viewed as inferior positives that induce weaker learning signals, or as hard negatives exhibiting higher contrast to other negative samples. In the asymmetric fashion, the adverse impacts of conflicting objectives between CL and adversarial learning can be effectively mitigated. Experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms existing Adversarial CL methods across different finetuning schemes without additional computational cost. The proposed A-InfoNCE is also a generic form that can be readily extended to other CL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/yqy2001/A-InfoNCE.

**Abstract:** We propose a new framework for differentially private optimization of convex functions which are Lipschitz in an arbitrary norm $\normx{\cdot}$. Our algorithms are based on a regularized exponential mechanism which samples from the density $\propto \exp(-k(F+Î¼r))$ where $F$ is the empirical loss and $r$ is a regularizer which is strongly convex with respect to $\normx{\cdot}$, generalizing a recent work of \cite{GLL22} to non-Euclidean settings. We show that this mechanism satisfies Gaussian differential privacy and solves both DP-ERM (empirical risk minimization) and DP-SCO (stochastic convex optimization), by using localization tools from convex geometry. Our framework is the first to apply to private convex optimization in general normed spaces, and directly recovers non-private SCO rates achieved by mirror descent, as the privacy parameter $\eps \to \infty$. As applications, for Lipschitz optimization in $\ell_p$ norms for all $p \in (1, 2)$, we obtain the first optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs; for $p = 1$, we improve tradeoffs obtained by the recent works \cite{AsiFKT21, BassilyGN21} by at least a logarithmic factor. Our $\ell_p$ norm and Schatten-$p$ norm optimization frameworks are complemented with polynomial-time samplers whose query complexity we explicitly bound.

**Abstract:** In operations of multi-agent teams ranging from homogeneous robot swarms to heterogeneous human-autonomy teams, unexpected events might occur. While efficiency of operation for multi-agent task allocation problems is the primary objective, it is essential that the decision-making framework is intelligent enough to manage unexpected task load with limited resources. Otherwise, operation effectiveness would drastically plummet with overloaded agents facing unforeseen risks. In this work, we present a decision-making framework for multi-agent teams to learn task allocation with the consideration of load management through decentralized reinforcement learning, where idling is encouraged and unnecessary resource usage is avoided. We illustrate the effect of load management on team performance and explore agent behaviors in example scenarios. Furthermore, a measure of agent importance in collaboration is developed to infer team resilience when facing handling potential overload situations.

**Abstract:** The seminal work of Cohen and Peng introduced Lewis weight sampling to the theoretical computer science community, yielding fast row sampling algorithms for approximating $d$-dimensional subspaces of $\ell_p$ up to $(1+Îµ)$ error. Several works have extended this important primitive to other settings, including the online coreset, sliding window, and adversarial streaming models. However, these results are only for $p\in\{1,2\}$, and results for $p=1$ require a suboptimal $\tilde O(d^2/Îµ^2)$ samples.
  In this work, we design the first nearly optimal $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for all $p\in(0,\infty)$ in the online coreset, sliding window, and the adversarial streaming models. In all three models, our algorithms store $\tilde O(d^{1\lor(p/2)}/Îµ^2)$ rows. This answers a substantial generalization of the main open question of [BDMMUWZ2020], and gives the first results for all $p\notin\{1,2\}$.
  Towards our result, we give the first analysis of "one-shot'' Lewis weight sampling of sampling rows proportionally to their Lewis weights, with sample complexity $\tilde O(d^{p/2}/Îµ^2)$ for $p>2$. Previously, this scheme was only known to have sample complexity $\tilde O(d^{p/2}/Îµ^5)$, whereas $\tilde O(d^{p/2}/Îµ^2)$ is known if a more sophisticated recursive sampling is used. The recursive sampling cannot be implemented online, thus necessitating an analysis of one-shot Lewis weight sampling. Our analysis uses a novel connection to online numerical linear algebra.
  As an application, we obtain the first one-pass streaming coreset algorithms for $(1+Îµ)$ approximation of important generalized linear models, such as logistic regression and $p$-probit regression. Our upper bounds are parameterized by a complexity parameter $Î¼$ introduced by [MSSW2018], and we show the first lower bounds showing that a linear dependence on $Î¼$ is necessary.

**Abstract:** Brain vessel image segmentation can be used as a promising biomarker for better prevention and treatment of different diseases. One successful approach is to consider the segmentation as an image-to-image translation task and perform a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn a transformation between two distributions. In this paper, we present a novel multi-view approach, MLP-GAN, which splits a 3D volumetric brain vessel image into three different dimensional 2D images (i.e., sagittal, coronal, axial) and then feed them into three different 2D cGANs. The proposed MLP-GAN not only alleviates the memory issue which exists in the original 3D neural networks but also retains 3D spatial information. Specifically, we utilize U-Net as the backbone for our generator and redesign the pattern of skip connection integrated with the MLP-Mixer which has attracted lots of attention recently. Our model obtains the ability to capture cross-patch information to learn global information with the MLP-Mixer. Extensive experiments are performed on the public brain vessel dataset that show our MLP-GAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. We release our code at https://github.com/bxie9/MLP-GAN

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of designing uniformly stable first-order optimization algorithms for empirical risk minimization. Uniform stability is often used to obtain generalization error bounds for optimization algorithms, and we are interested in a general approach to achieve it. For Euclidean geometry, we suggest a black-box conversion which given a smooth optimization algorithm, produces a uniformly stable version of the algorithm while maintaining its convergence rate up to logarithmic factors. Using this reduction we obtain a (nearly) optimal algorithm for smooth optimization with convergence rate $\widetilde{O}(1/T^2)$ and uniform stability $O(T^2/n)$, resolving an open problem of Chen et al. (2018); Attia and Koren (2021). For more general geometries, we develop a variant of Mirror Descent for smooth optimization with convergence rate $\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ and uniform stability $O(T/n)$, leaving open the question of devising a general conversion method as in the Euclidean case.

**Abstract:** Image schema is a recurrent pattern of reasoning where one entity is mapped into another. Image schema is similar to conceptual metaphor and is also related to metaphoric gesture. Our main goal is to generate metaphoric gestures for an Embodied Conversational Agent.
  We propose a technique to learn the vector representation of image schemas. As far as we are aware of, this is the first work which addresses that problem. Our technique uses Ravenet et al's algorithm which we use to compute the image schemas from the text input and also BERT and SenseBERT which we use as the base word embedding technique to calculate the final vector representation of the image schema. Our representation learning technique works by clustering: word embedding vectors which belong to the same image schema should be relatively closer to each other, and thus form a cluster.
  With the image schemas representable as vectors, it also becomes possible to have a notion that some image schemas are closer or more similar to each other than to the others because the distance between the vectors is a proxy of the dissimilarity between the corresponding image schemas. Therefore, after obtaining the vector representation of the image schemas, we calculate the distances between those vectors. Based on these, we create visualizations to illustrate the relative distances between the different image schemas.

**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm to estimate the path-gradient of both the reverse and forward Kullback-Leibler divergence for an arbitrary manifestly invertible normalizing flow. The resulting path-gradient estimators are straightforward to implement, have lower variance, and lead not only to faster convergence of training but also to better overall approximation results compared to standard total gradient estimators. We also demonstrate that path-gradient training is less susceptible to mode-collapse. In light of our results, we expect that path-gradient estimators will become the new standard method to train normalizing flows for variational inference.

**Abstract:** Neural networks are known to produce over-confident predictions on input images, even when these images are out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This limits the applications of neural network models in real-world scenarios, where OOD samples exist. Many existing approaches identify the OOD instances via exploiting various cues, such as finding irregular patterns in the feature space, logits space, gradient space or the raw space of images. In contrast, this paper proposes a simple Test-time Linear Training (ETLT) method for OOD detection. Empirically, we find that the probabilities of input images being out-of-distribution are surprisingly linearly correlated to the features extracted by neural networks. To be specific, many state-of-the-art OOD algorithms, although designed to measure reliability in different ways, actually lead to OOD scores mostly linearly related to their image features. Thus, by simply learning a linear regression model trained from the paired image features and inferred OOD scores at test-time, we can make a more precise OOD prediction for the test instances. We further propose an online variant of the proposed method, which achieves promising performance and is more practical in real-world applications. Remarkably, we improve FPR95 from $51.37\%$ to $12.30\%$ on CIFAR-10 datasets with maximum softmax probability as the base OOD detector. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show the efficacy of ETLT for OOD detection task.

**Abstract:** We introduce BusyBoard, a toy-inspired robot learning environment that leverages a diverse set of articulated objects and inter-object functional relations to provide rich visual feedback for robot interactions. Based on this environment, we introduce a learning framework, BusyBot, which allows an agent to jointly acquire three fundamental capabilities (interaction, reasoning, and planning) in an integrated and self-supervised manner. With the rich sensory feedback provided by BusyBoard, BusyBot first learns a policy to efficiently interact with the environment; then with data collected using the policy, BusyBot reasons the inter-object functional relations through a causal discovery network; and finally by combining the learned interaction policy and relation reasoning skill, the agent is able to perform goal-conditioned manipulation tasks. We evaluate BusyBot in both simulated and real-world environments, and validate its generalizability to unseen objects and relations. Video is available at https://youtu.be/EJ98xBJZ9ek.

**Abstract:** Heart rate variability (HRV) indices describe properties of interbeat intervals in electrocardiogram (ECG). Usually HRV is measured exclusively in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) excluding any form of paroxysmal rhythm. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most widespread cardiac arrhythmia in human population. Usually such abnormal rhythm is not analyzed and assumed to be chaotic and unpredictable. Nonetheless, ranges of HRV indices differ between patients with AF, yet physiological characteristics which influence them are poorly understood. In this study, we propose a statistical model that describes relationship between HRV indices in NSR and AF. The model is based on Mahalanobis distance, the k-Nearest neighbour approach and multivariate normal distribution framework. Verification of the method was performed using 10 min intervals of NSR and AF that were extracted from long-term Holter ECGs. For validation we used Bhattacharyya distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov 2-sample test in a k-fold procedure. The model is able to predict at least 7 HRV indices with high precision.

**Abstract:** The deep learning literature is continuously updated with new architectures and training techniques. However, weight initialization is overlooked by most recent research, despite some intriguing findings regarding random weights. On the other hand, recent works have been approaching Network Science to understand the structure and dynamics of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) after training. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the centrality of neurons in randomly initialized networks. We show that a higher neuronal strength variance may decrease performance, while a lower neuronal strength variance usually improves it. A new method is then proposed to rewire neuronal connections according to a preferential attachment (PA) rule based on their strength, which significantly reduces the strength variance of layers initialized by common methods. In this sense, PA rewiring only reorganizes connections, while preserving the magnitude and distribution of the weights. We show through an extensive statistical analysis in image classification that performance is improved in most cases, both during training and testing, when using both simple and complex architectures and learning schedules. Our results show that, aside from the magnitude, the organization of the weights is also relevant for better initialization of deep ANNs.

**Abstract:** Although large language models (LLMs) often produce impressive outputs, they also fail to reason and be factual. We set out to investigate how these limitations affect the LLM's ability to answer and reason about difficult real-world based questions. We applied the human-aligned GPT-3 (InstructGPT) to answer multiple-choice medical exam questions (USMLE and MedMCQA) and medical research questions (PubMedQA). We investigated Chain-of-thought (think step by step) prompts, grounding (augmenting the prompt with search results) and few-shot (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars). For a subset of the USMLE questions, a medical domain expert reviewed and annotated the model's reasoning. Overall, GPT-3 achieved a substantial improvement in state-of-the-art machine learning performance. We observed that GPT-3 is often knowledgeable and can reason about medical questions. GPT-3, when confronted with a question it cannot answer, will still attempt to answer, often resulting in a biased predictive distribution. LLMs are not on par with human performance but our results suggest the emergence of reasoning patterns that are compatible with medical problem-solving. We speculate that scaling model and data, enhancing prompt alignment and allowing for better contextualization of the completions will be sufficient for LLMs to reach human-level performance on this type of task.

**Abstract:** Alongside the rapid development of data collection and analysis techniques in recent years, there is increasingly an emphasis on the need to address information leakage associated with such usage of data. To this end, much work in the privacy literature is devoted to the protection of individual users and contributors of data. However, some situations instead require a different notion of data confidentiality involving global properties aggregated over the records of a dataset. Such notions of information protection are particularly applicable for business and organization data, where global properties may reflect trade secrets, or demographic data, which can be harmful if mishandled. Recent work on property inference attacks furthermore shows how data analysis algorithms can be susceptible to leaking these global properties of data, highlighting the importance of developing mechanisms that can protect such information.
  In this work, we demonstrate how a distribution privacy framework can be applied to formalize the problem of protecting global properties of datasets. Given this framework, we investigate several mechanisms and their tradeoffs for providing this notion of data confidentiality. We analyze the theoretical protection guarantees offered by these mechanisms under various data assumptions, then implement and empirically evaluate these mechanisms for several data analysis tasks. The results of our experiments show that our mechanisms can indeed reduce the effectiveness of practical property inference attacks while providing utility substantially greater than a crude group differential privacy baseline. Our work thus provides groundwork for theoretically supported mechanisms for protecting global properties of datasets.

**Abstract:** Machine learning models have demonstrated promising performance in many areas. However, the concerns that they can be biased against specific groups hinder their adoption in high-stake applications. Thus it is essential to ensure fairness in machine learning models. Most of the previous efforts require access to sensitive attributes for mitigating bias. Nonetheless, it is often infeasible to obtain large scale of data with sensitive attributes due to people's increasing awareness of privacy and the legal compliance. Therefore, an important research question is how to make fair predictions under privacy? In this paper, we study a novel problem on fair classification in a semi-private setting, where most of the sensitive attributes are private and only a small amount of clean sensitive attributes are available. To this end, we propose a novel framework FairSP that can first learn to correct the noisy sensitive attributes under privacy guarantee via exploiting the limited clean sensitive attributes. Then, it jointly models the corrected and clean data in an adversarial way for debiasing and prediction. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed model can ensure fairness when most of the sensitive attributes are private. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for making fair predictions under privacy and maintaining high accuracy.

**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is widely adopted in numerous application areas, such as data preprocessing, image editing, and creativity support. However, GAN's 'black box' nature prevents non-expert users from controlling what data a model generates, spawning a plethora of prior work that focused on algorithm-driven approaches to extract editing directions to control GAN. Complementarily, we propose a GANzilla: a user-driven tool that empowers a user with the classic scatter/gather technique to iteratively discover directions to meet their editing goals. In a study with 12 participants, GANzilla users were able to discover directions that (i) edited images to match provided examples (closed-ended tasks) and that (ii) met a high-level goal, e.g., making the face happier, while showing diversity across individuals (open-ended tasks).

**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models have established the state-of-the-art on various natural language processing tasks, including dialogue summarization, which allows the reader to quickly access key information from long conversations in meetings, interviews or phone calls. However, such dialogues are still difficult to handle with current models because the spontaneity of the language involves expressions that are rarely present in the corpora used for pre-training the language models. Moreover, the vast majority of the work accomplished in this field has been focused on English. In this work, we present a study on the summarization of spontaneous oral dialogues in French using several language specific pre-trained models: BARThez, and BelGPT-2, as well as multilingual pre-trained models: mBART, mBARThez, and mT5. Experiments were performed on the DECODA (Call Center) dialogue corpus whose task is to generate abstractive synopses from call center conversations between a caller and one or several agents depending on the situation. Results show that the BARThez models offer the best performance far above the previous state-of-the-art on DECODA. We further discuss the limits of such pre-trained models and the challenges that must be addressed for summarizing spontaneous dialogues.

**Abstract:** Tensor decomposition has become an essential tool in many data science applications. Sparse Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP) is the pivotal kernel in tensor decomposition algorithms that decompose higher-order real-world large tensors into multiple matrices. Accelerating MTTKRP can speed up the tensor decomposition process immensely. Sparse MTTKRP is a challenging kernel to accelerate due to its irregular memory access characteristics. Implementing accelerators on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for kernels such as MTTKRP is attractive due to the energy efficiency and the inherent parallelism of FPGA. This paper explores the opportunities, key challenges, and an approach for designing a custom memory controller on FPGA for MTTKRP while exploring the parameter space of such a custom memory controller.

In this work, we present a novel, versatile and transparent framework for jet representation; invariant to Lorentz group boosts, which achieves high accuracy on jet tagging benchmarks while being orders of magnitudes faster to train and evaluate than other modern approaches for both supervised and unsupervised schemes.

**Abstract:** The action governor is an add-on scheme to a nominal control loop that monitors and adjusts the control actions to enforce safety specifications expressed as pointwise-in-time state and control constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Robust Action Governor (RAG) for systems the dynamics of which can be represented using discrete-time Piecewise Affine (PWA) models with both parametric and additive uncertainties and subject to non-convex constraints. We develop the theoretical properties and computational approaches for the RAG. After that, we introduce the use of the RAG for realizing safe Reinforcement Learning (RL), i.e., ensuring all-time constraint satisfaction during online RL exploration-and-exploitation process. This development enables safe real-time evolution of the control policy and adaptation to changes in the operating environment and system parameters (due to aging, damage, etc.). We illustrate the effectiveness of the RAG in constraint enforcement and safe RL using the RAG by considering their applications to a soft-landing problem of a mass-spring-damper system.

**Abstract:** In recent years, many troll accounts have emerged to manipulate social media opinion. Detecting and eradicating trolling is a critical issue for social-networking platforms because businesses, abusers, and nation-state-sponsored troll farms use false and automated accounts. NLP techniques are used to extract data from social networking text, such as Twitter tweets. In many text processing applications, word embedding representation methods, such as BERT, have performed better than prior NLP techniques, offering novel breaks to precisely comprehend and categorize social-networking information for various tasks. This paper implements and compares nine deep learning-based troll tweet detection architectures, with three models for each BERT, ELMo, and GloVe word embedding model. Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and classification accuracy are used to evaluate each architecture. From the experimental results, most architectures using BERT models improved troll tweet detection. A customized ELMo-based architecture with a GRU classifier has the highest AUC for detecting troll messages. The proposed architectures can be used by various social-based systems to detect troll messages in the future.

**Abstract:** Imputation of missing images via source-to-target modality translation can facilitate downstream tasks in medical imaging. A pervasive approach for synthesizing target images involves one-shot mapping through generative adversarial networks (GAN). Yet, GAN models that implicitly characterize the image distribution can suffer from limited sample fidelity and diversity. Here, we propose a novel method based on adversarial diffusion modeling, SynDiff, for improved reliability in medical image synthesis. To capture a direct correlate of the image distribution, SynDiff leverages a conditional diffusion process to progressively map noise and source images onto the target image. For fast and accurate image sampling during inference, large diffusion steps are coupled with adversarial projections in the reverse diffusion direction. To enable training on unpaired datasets, a cycle-consistent architecture is devised with two coupled diffusion processes to synthesize the target given source and the source given target. Extensive assessments are reported on the utility of SynDiff against competing GAN and diffusion models in multi-contrast MRI and MRI-CT translation. Our demonstrations indicate that SynDiff offers superior performance against competing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Abstract:** We introduce SPIRAL, a SuPerlinearly convergent Incremental pRoximal ALgorithm, for solving nonconvex regularized finite sum problems under a relative smoothness assumption. In the spirit of SVRG and SARAH, each iteration of SPIRAL consists of an inner and an outer loop. It combines incremental and full (proximal) gradient updates with a linesearch. It is shown that when using quasi-Newton directions, superlinear convergence is attained under mild assumptions at the limit points. More importantly, thanks to said linesearch, global convergence is ensured while it is shown that unit stepsize will be eventually always accepted. Simulation results on different convex, nonconvex, and non-Lipschitz differentiable problems show that our algorithm as well as its adaptive variant are competitive to the state of the art.

**Abstract:** Chinese characters carry a wealth of morphological and semantic information; therefore, the semantic enhancement of the morphology of Chinese characters has drawn significant attention. The previous methods were intended to directly extract information from a whole Chinese character image, which usually cannot capture both global and local information simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a stroke-based autoencoder(SAE), to model the sophisticated morphology of Chinese characters with the self-supervised method. Following its canonical writing order, we first represent a Chinese character as a series of stroke images with a fixed writing order, and then our SAE model is trained to reconstruct this stroke image sequence. This pre-trained SAE model can predict the stroke image series for unseen characters, as long as their strokes or radicals appeared in the training set. We have designed two contrasting SAE architectures on different forms of stroke images. One is fine-tuned on existing stroke-based method for zero-shot recognition of handwritten Chinese characters, and the other is applied to enrich the Chinese word embeddings from their morphological features. The experimental results validate that after pre-training, our SAE architecture outperforms other existing methods in zero-shot recognition and enhances the representation of Chinese characters with their abundant morphological and semantic information.

**Abstract:** Combinatorial optimization problems can be solved by heuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) which aims to find the global minima solution within a large search space through thermal fluctuations. The algorithm generates new solutions through Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques. The latter can result in severe limitations, such as slow convergence and a tendency to stay within the same local search space at small temperatures. To overcome these shortcomings, we use the variational classical annealing (VCA) framework that combines autoregressive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with traditional annealing to sample solutions independent of each other. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using VCA as an approach to solving real-world optimization problems. We explore VCA's performance in comparison with SA at solving three popular optimization problems: the maximum cut problem (Max-Cut), the nurse scheduling problem (NSP), and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). For all three problems, we find that VCA outperforms SA on average in the asymptotic limit. Interestingly, we reach large system sizes up to $256$ cities for the TSP. We conclude that in the best-case scenario, VCA can serve as a great alternative when SA fails to find the optimal solution.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning has been introduced as a new machine learning paradigm enhancing the use of local devices. At a server level, FL regularly aggregates models learned locally on distributed clients to obtain a more general model. Current solutions rely on the availability of large amounts of stored data at the client side in order to fine-tune the models sent by the server. Such setting is not realistic in mobile pervasive computing where data storage must be kept low and data characteristic can change dramatically. To account for this variability, a solution is to use the data regularly collected by the client to progressively adapt the received model. But such naive approach exposes clients to the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting. To address this problem, we have defined a Federated Continual Learning approach which is mainly based on distillation. Our approach allows a better use of resources, eliminating the need to retrain from scratch at the arrival of new data and reducing memory usage by limiting the amount of data to be stored. This proposal has been evaluated in the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) domain and has shown to effectively reduce the catastrophic forgetting effect.

**Abstract:** Federated Learning has been introduced as a new machine learning paradigm enhancing the use of local devices. At a server level, FL regularly aggregates models learned locally on distributed clients to obtain a more general model. In this way, no private data is sent over the network, and the communication cost is reduced. However, current solutions rely on the availability of large amounts of stored data at the client side in order to fine-tune the models sent by the server. Such setting is not realistic in mobile pervasive computing where data storage must be kept low and data characteristic (distribution) can change dramatically. To account for this variability, a solution is to use the data regularly collected by the client to progressively adapt the received model. But such naive approach exposes clients to the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate this problem in the mobile human activity recognition context on smartphones.

**Abstract:** Time series analysis has achieved great success in diverse applications such as network security, environmental monitoring, and medical informatics. Learning similarities among different time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis such as clustering and anomaly detection. It often remains unclear what kind of distance metric is suitable for similarity learning due to the complex temporal dynamics of the time series generated from event-triggered sensing, which is common in diverse applications, including automated driving, interactive healthcare, and smart home automation. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning task-aware similarities among unlabeled event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-scale sequence autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for explaining. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.

**Abstract:** Over the last decade, Neural Networks (NNs) have been widely used in numerous applications including safety-critical ones such as autonomous systems. Despite their emerging adoption, it is well known that NNs are susceptible to Adversarial Attacks. Hence, it is highly important to provide guarantees that such systems work correctly. To remedy these issues we introduce a framework for repairing unsafe NNs w.r.t. safety specification, that is by utilizing satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. Our method is able to search for a new, safe NN representation, by modifying only a few of its weight values. In addition, our technique attempts to maximize the similarity to original network with regard to its decision boundaries. We perform extensive experiments which demonstrate the capability of our proposed framework to yield safe NNs w.r.t. the Adversarial Robustness property, with only a mild loss of accuracy (in terms of similarity). Moreover, we compare our method with a naive baseline to empirically prove its effectiveness. To conclude, we provide an algorithm to automatically repair NNs given safety properties, and suggest a few heuristics to improve its computational performance. Currently, by following this approach we are capable of producing small-sized (i.e., with up to few hundreds of parameters) correct NNs, composed of the piecewise linear ReLU activation function. Nevertheless, our framework is general in the sense that it can synthesize NNs w.r.t. any decidable fragment of first-order logic specification.

**Abstract:** Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently reached state-of-the-art Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) performance. However, recent research has shown that typical CNNs' learning performance is limited since they are homogeneous networks with a simple (linear) neuron model. With their heterogeneous network structure incorporating non-linear neurons, Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) have recently been proposed to address this drawback. Self-ONNs are self-organized variations of ONNs with the generative neuron model that can generate any non-linear function using the Taylor approximation. In this study, in order to improve the state-of-the-art performance level in HTR, the 2D Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) in the core of a novel network model are proposed. Moreover, deformable convolutions, which have recently been demonstrated to tackle variations in the writing styles better, are utilized in this study. The results over the IAM English dataset and HADARA80P Arabic dataset show that the proposed model with the operational layers of Self-ONNs significantly improves Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER). Compared with its counterpart CNNs, Self-ONNs reduce CER and WER by 1.2% and 3.4 % in the HADARA80P and 0.199% and 1.244% in the IAM dataset. The results over the benchmark IAM demonstrate that the proposed model with the operational layers of Self-ONNs outperforms recent deep CNN models by a significant margin while the use of Self-ONNs with deformable convolutions demonstrates exceptional results.

**Abstract:** Adversarial deep learning is to train robust DNNs against adversarial attacks, which is one of the major research focuses of deep learning. Game theory has been used to answer some of the basic questions about adversarial deep learning such as the existence of a classifier with optimal robustness and the existence of optimal adversarial samples for a given class of classifiers. In most previous work, adversarial deep learning was formulated as a simultaneous game and the strategy spaces are assumed to be certain probability distributions in order for the Nash equilibrium to exist. But, this assumption is not applicable to the practical situation. In this paper, we give answers to these basic questions for the practical case where the classifiers are DNNs with a given structure, by formulating the adversarial deep learning as sequential games. The existence of Stackelberg equilibria for these games are proved. Furthermore, it is shown that the equilibrium DNN has the largest adversarial accuracy among all DNNs with the same structure, when Carlini-Wagner's margin loss is used. Trade-off between robustness and accuracy in adversarial deep learning is also studied from game theoretical aspect.

**Abstract:** Video frame interpolation (VFI) serves as a useful tool for many video processing applications. Recently, it has also been applied in the video compression domain for enhancing both conventional video codecs and learning-based compression architectures. While there has been an increased focus on the development of enhanced frame interpolation algorithms in recent years, the perceptual quality assessment of interpolated content remains an open field of research. In this paper, we present a bespoke full reference video quality metric for VFI, FloLPIPS, that builds on the popular perceptual image quality metric, LPIPS, which captures the perceptual degradation in extracted image feature space. In order to enhance the performance of LPIPS for evaluating interpolated content, we re-designed its spatial feature aggregation step by using the temporal distortion (through comparing optical flows) to weight the feature difference maps. Evaluated on the BVI-VFI database, which contains 180 test sequences with various frame interpolation artefacts, FloLPIPS shows superior correlation performance (with statistical significance) with subjective ground truth over 12 popular quality assessors. To facilitate further research in VFI quality assessment, our code is publicly available at https://danielism97.github.io/FloLPIPS.

**Abstract:** The spread of COVID-19 has brought a huge disaster to the world, and the automatic segmentation of infection regions can help doctors to make diagnosis quickly and reduce workload. However, there are several challenges for the accurate and complete segmentation, such as the scattered infection area distribution, complex background noises, and blurred segmentation boundaries. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel network for automatic COVID-19 lung infection segmentation from CT images, named BCS-Net, which considers the boundary, context, and semantic attributes. The BCS-Net follows an encoder-decoder architecture, and more designs focus on the decoder stage that includes three progressively Boundary-Context-Semantic Reconstruction (BCSR) blocks. In each BCSR block, the attention-guided global context (AGGC) module is designed to learn the most valuable encoder features for decoder by highlighting the important spatial and boundary locations and modeling the global context dependence. Besides, a semantic guidance (SG) unit generates the semantic guidance map to refine the decoder features by aggregating multi-scale high-level features at the intermediate resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing competitors both qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Abstract:** The propagation of rumours on social media poses an important threat to societies, so that various techniques for rumour detection have been proposed recently. Yet, existing work focuses on \emph{what} entities constitute a rumour, but provides little support to understand \emph{why} the entities have been classified as such. This prevents an effective evaluation of the detected rumours as well as the design of countermeasures. In this work, we argue that explanations for detected rumours may be given in terms of examples of related rumours detected in the past. A diverse set of similar rumours helps users to generalize, i.e., to understand the properties that govern the detection of rumours. Since the spread of rumours in social media is commonly modelled using feature-annotated graphs, we propose a query-by-example approach that, given a rumour graph, extracts the $k$ most similar and diverse subgraphs from past rumours. The challenge is that all of the computations require fast assessment of similarities between graphs. To achieve an efficient and adaptive realization of the approach in a streaming setting, we present a novel graph representation learning technique and report on implementation considerations. Our evaluation experiments show that our approach outperforms baseline techniques in delivering meaningful explanations for various rumour propagation behaviours.

**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly sensitive to imperceptible malicious perturbations, known as adversarial attacks. Following the discovery of this vulnerability in real-world imaging and vision applications, the associated safety concerns have attracted vast research attention, and many defense techniques have been developed. Most of these defense methods rely on adversarial training (AT) -- training the classification network on images perturbed according to a specific threat model, which defines the magnitude of the allowed modification. Although AT leads to promising results, training on a specific threat model fails to generalize to other types of perturbations. A different approach utilizes a preprocessing step to remove the adversarial perturbation from the attacked image. In this work, we follow the latter path and aim to develop a technique that leads to robust classifiers across various realizations of threat models. To this end, we harness the recent advances in stochastic generative modeling, and means to leverage these for sampling from conditional distributions. Our defense relies on an addition of Gaussian i.i.d noise to the attacked image, followed by a pretrained diffusion process -- an architecture that performs a stochastic iterative process over a denoising network, yielding a high perceptual quality denoised outcome. The obtained robustness with this stochastic preprocessing step is validated through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing that our method outperforms the leading defense methods under various threat models.

**Abstract:** We investigate the problem of coordinating two robot arms to solve non-monotone tabletop multi-object rearrangement tasks. In a non-monotone rearrangement task, complex object-object dependencies exist that require moving some objects multiple times to solve an instance. In working with two arms in a large workspace, some objects must be handed off between the robots, which further complicates the planning process. For the challenging dual-arm tabletop rearrangement problem, we develop effective task planning algorithms for scheduling the pick-n-place sequence that can be properly distributed between the two arms. We show that, even without using a sophisticated motion planner, our method achieves significant time savings in comparison to greedy approaches and naive parallelization of single-robot plans.

**Abstract:** Edge enabled Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform is of great significance to accelerate the development of smart industry. However, with the dramatic increase in real-time IIoT applications, it is a great challenge to support fast response time, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, Time Sensitive Network (TSN) is recently researched to realize low latency communication via deterministic scheduling. To the best of our knowledge, the combinability of multiple flows, which can significantly affect the scheduling performance, has never been systematically analyzed before. In this article, we first analyze the combinability problem. Then a non-collision theory based deterministic scheduling (NDS) method is proposed to achieve ultra-low latency communication for the time-sensitive flows. Moreover, to improve bandwidth utilization, a dynamic queue scheduling (DQS) method is presented for the best-effort flows. Experiment results demonstrate that NDS/DQS can well support deterministic ultra-low latency services and guarantee efficient bandwidth utilization.
