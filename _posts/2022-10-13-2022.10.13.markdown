**Abstract:** While 6D object pose estimation has wide applications across computer vision and robotics, it remains far from being solved due to the lack of annotations. The problem becomes even more challenging when moving to category-level 6D pose, which requires generalization to unseen instances. Current approaches are restricted by leveraging annotations from simulation or collected from humans. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by introducing a self-supervised learning approach trained directly on large-scale real-world object videos for category-level 6D pose estimation in the wild. Our framework reconstructs the canonical 3D shape of an object category and learns dense correspondences between input images and the canonical shape via surface embedding. For training, we propose novel geometrical cycle-consistency losses which construct cycles across 2D-3D spaces, across different instances and different time steps. The learned correspondence can be applied for 6D pose estimation and other downstream tasks such as keypoint transfer. Surprisingly, our method, without any human annotations or simulators, can achieve on-par or even better performance than previous supervised or semi-supervised methods on in-the-wild images.

**Abstract:** Recent progress in deep generative models has improved the quality of neural vocoders in speech domain. However, generating a high-quality singing voice remains challenging due to a wider variety of musical expressions in pitch, loudness, and pronunciations. In this work, we propose a hierarchical diffusion model for singing voice neural vocoders. The proposed method consists of multiple diffusion models operating in different sampling rates; the model at the lowest sampling rate focuses on generating accurate low-frequency components such as pitch, and other models progressively generate the waveform at higher sampling rates on the basis of the data at the lower sampling rate and acoustic features. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces high-quality singing voices for multiple singers, outperforming state-of-the-art neural vocoders with a similar range of computational costs.

**Abstract:** Text embeddings are commonly evaluated on a small set of datasets from a single task not covering their possible applications to other tasks. It is unclear whether state-of-the-art embeddings on semantic textual similarity (STS) can be equally well applied to other tasks like clustering or reranking. This makes progress in the field difficult to track, as various models are constantly being proposed without proper evaluation. To solve this problem, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). MTEB spans 8 embedding tasks covering a total of 56 datasets and 112 languages. Through the benchmarking of 33 models on MTEB, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of text embeddings to date. We find that no particular text embedding method dominates across all tasks. This suggests that the field has yet to converge on a universal text embedding method and scale it up sufficiently to provide state-of-the-art results on all embedding tasks. MTEB comes with open-source code and a public leaderboard at https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard.

**Abstract:** We introduce a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach for contact-rich manipulation tasks with articulated mechanisms. The extracted policy from a single human demonstration generalizes to different mechanisms of the same type and is robust against environmental variations. The key to achieving such generalization and robustness from a single human demonstration is to autonomously augment the initial demonstration to gather additional information through purposefully interacting with the environment. Our real-world experiments on complex mechanisms with multi-DOF demonstrate that our approach can reliably accomplish the task in a changing environment.

**Abstract:** Machine learning techniques rely on large and diverse datasets for generalization. Computer vision, natural language processing, and other applications can often reuse public datasets to train many different models. However, due to differences in physical configurations, it is challenging to leverage public datasets for training robotic control policies on new robot platforms or for new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel framework, ExAug to augment the experiences of different robot platforms from multiple datasets in diverse environments. ExAug leverages a simple principle: by extracting 3D information in the form of a point cloud, we can create much more complex and structured augmentations, utilizing both generating synthetic images and geometric-aware penalization that would have been suitable in the same situation for a different robot, with different size, turning radius, and camera placement. The trained policy is evaluated on two new robot platforms with three different cameras in indoor and outdoor environments with obstacles.

**Abstract:** Detecting anomalies from a series of temporal networks has many applications, including road accidents in transport networks and suspicious events in social networks. While there are many methods for network anomaly detection, statistical methods are under utilised in this space even though they have a long history and proven capability in handling temporal dependencies. In this paper, we introduce \textit{oddnet}, a feature-based network anomaly detection method that uses time series methods to model temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of oddnet on synthetic and real-world datasets. The R package oddnet implements this algorithm.

<p>Edoardo Cetin, Oya Celiktutan</p></summary>
<p>

**Abstract:** We introduce a new framework that performs decision-making in reinforcement learning (RL) as an iterative reasoning process. We model agent behavior as the steady-state distribution of a parameterized reasoning Markov chain (RMC), optimized with a new tractable estimate of the policy gradient. We perform action selection by simulating the RMC for enough reasoning steps to approach its steady-state distribution. We show our framework has several useful properties that are inherently missing from traditional RL. For instance, it allows agent behavior to approximate any continuous distribution over actions by parameterizing the RMC with a simple Gaussian transition function. Moreover, the number of reasoning steps to reach convergence can scale adaptively with the difficulty of each action selection decision and can be accelerated by re-using past solutions. Our resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in popular Mujoco and DeepMind Control benchmarks, both for proprioceptive and pixel-based tasks.

**Abstract:** Neural fields have rapidly been adopted for representing 3D signals, but their application to more classical 2D image-processing has been relatively limited. In this paper, we consider one of the most important operations in image processing: upsampling. In deep learning, learnable upsampling layers have extensively been used for single image super-resolution. We propose to parameterize upsampling kernels as neural fields. This parameterization leads to a compact architecture that obtains a 40-fold reduction in the number of parameters when compared with competing arbitrary-scale super-resolution architectures. When upsampling images of size 256x256 we show that our architecture is 2x-10x more efficient than competing arbitrary-scale super-resolution architectures, and more efficient than sub-pixel convolutions when instantiated to a single-scale model. In the general setting, these gains grow polynomially with the square of the target scale. We validate our method on standard benchmarks showing such efficiency gains can be achieved without sacrifices in super-resolution performance.

<p>

**Abstract:** The recent proliferation of NISQ devices has made it imperative to understand their computational power. In this work, we define and study the complexity class $\textsf{NISQ} $, which is intended to encapsulate problems that can be efficiently solved by a classical computer with access to a NISQ device. To model existing devices, we assume the device can (1) noisily initialize all qubits, (2) apply many noisy quantum gates, and (3) perform a noisy measurement on all qubits. We first give evidence that $\textsf{BPP}\subsetneq \textsf{NISQ}\subsetneq \textsf{BQP}$, by demonstrating super-polynomial oracle separations among the three classes, based on modifications of Simon's problem. We then consider the power of $\textsf{NISQ}$ for three well-studied problems. For unstructured search, we prove that $\textsf{NISQ}$ cannot achieve a Grover-like quadratic speedup over $\textsf{BPP}$. For the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, we show that $\textsf{NISQ}$ only needs a number of queries logarithmic in what is required for $\textsf{BPP}$. Finally, for a quantum state learning problem, we prove that $\textsf{NISQ}$ is exponentially weaker than classical computation with access to noiseless constant-depth quantum circuits.

**Abstract:** Machine learning-based modeling of physical systems has experienced increased interest in recent years. Despite some impressive progress, there is still a lack of benchmarks for Scientific ML that are easy to use but still challenging and representative of a wide range of problems. We introduce PDEBench, a benchmark suite of time-dependent simulation tasks based on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). PDEBench comprises both code and data to benchmark the performance of novel machine learning models against both classical numerical simulations and machine learning baselines. Our proposed set of benchmark problems contribute the following unique features: (1) A much wider range of PDEs compared to existing benchmarks, ranging from relatively common examples to more realistic and difficult problems; (2) much larger ready-to-use datasets compared to prior work, comprising multiple simulation runs across a larger number of initial and boundary conditions and PDE parameters; (3) more extensible source codes with user-friendly APIs for data generation and baseline results with popular machine learning models (FNO, U-Net, PINN, Gradient-Based Inverse Method). PDEBench allows researchers to extend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and to compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods. We also propose new evaluation metrics with the aim to provide a more holistic understanding of learning methods in the context of Scientific ML. With those metrics we identify tasks which are challenging for recent ML methods and propose these tasks as future challenges for the community.

<p>

**Abstract:** We propose to perform self-supervised disentanglement of depth and camera pose from large-scale videos. We introduce an Autoencoder-based method to reconstruct the input video frames for training, without using any ground-truth annotations of depth and camera. The model encoders estimate the monocular depth and the camera pose. The decoder then constructs a Multiplane NeRF representation based on the depth encoder feature, and renders the input frames with the estimated camera. The learning is supervised by the reconstruction error, based on the assumption that the scene structure does not change in short periods of time in videos. Once the model is learned, it can be applied to multiple applications including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and single image novel view synthesis. We show substantial improvements over previous self-supervised approaches on all tasks and even better results than counterparts trained with camera ground-truths in some applications. Our code will be made publicly available. Our project page is: https://oasisyang.github.io/self-mpinerf .

**Abstract:** In this work, we explore techniques for augmenting interactive agents with information from symbolic modules, much like humans use tools like calculators and GPS systems to assist with arithmetic and navigation. We test our agent's abilities in text games -- challenging benchmarks for evaluating the multi-step reasoning abilities of game agents in grounded, language-based environments. Our experimental study indicates that injecting the actions from these symbolic modules into the action space of a behavior cloned transformer agent increases performance on four text game benchmarks that test arithmetic, navigation, sorting, and common sense reasoning by an average of 22%, allowing an agent to reach the highest possible performance on unseen games. This action injection technique is easily extended to new agents, environments, and symbolic modules.

<p>

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of automatically generating longer stories of over two thousand words. Compared to prior work on shorter stories, long-range plot coherence and relevance are more central challenges here. We propose the Recursive Reprompting and Revision framework (Re3) to address these challenges by (a) prompting a general-purpose language model to construct a structured overarching plan, and (b) generating story passages by repeatedly injecting contextual information from both the plan and current story state into a language model prompt. We then revise by (c) reranking different continuations for plot coherence and premise relevance, and finally (d) editing the best continuation for factual consistency. Compared to similar-length stories generated directly from the same base model, human evaluators judged substantially more of Re3's stories as having a coherent overarching plot (by 14% absolute increase), and relevant to the given initial premise (by 20%).

**Abstract:** A grand goal in deep learning research is to learn representations capable of generalizing across distribution shifts. Disentanglement is one promising direction aimed at aligning a models representations with the underlying factors generating the data (e.g. color or background). Existing disentanglement methods, however, rely on an often unrealistic assumption: that factors are statistically independent. In reality, factors (like object color and shape) are correlated. To address this limitation, we propose a relaxed disentanglement criterion - the Hausdorff Factorized Support (HFS) criterion - that encourages a factorized support, rather than a factorial distribution, by minimizing a Hausdorff distance. This allows for arbitrary distributions of the factors over their support, including correlations between them. We show that the use of HFS consistently facilitates disentanglement and recovery of ground-truth factors across a variety of correlation settings and benchmarks, even under severe training correlations and correlation shifts, with in parts over +60% in relative improvement over existing disentanglement methods. In addition, we find that leveraging HFS for representation learning can even facilitate transfer to downstream tasks such as classification under distribution shifts. We hope our original approach and positive empirical results inspire further progress on the open problem of robust generalization.

However, this line of work is predominantly limited to updating single associations. We develop MEMIT, a method for directly updating a language model with many memories, demonstrating experimentally that it can scale up to thousands of associations for GPT-J (6B) and GPT-NeoX (20B), exceeding prior work by orders of magnitude.

<p>

**Abstract:** Providing densely shaped reward functions for RL algorithms is often exceedingly challenging, motivating the development of RL algorithms that can learn from easier-to-specify sparse reward functions. This sparsity poses new exploration challenges. One common way to address this problem is using demonstrations to provide initial signal about regions of the state space with high rewards. However, prior RL from demonstrations algorithms introduce significant complexity and many hyperparameters, making them hard to implement and tune. We introduce Monte Carlo Augmented Actor Critic (MCAC), a parameter free modification to standard actor-critic algorithms which initializes the replay buffer with demonstrations and computes a modified $Q$-value by taking the maximum of the standard temporal distance (TD) target and a Monte Carlo estimate of the reward-to-go. This encourages exploration in the neighborhood of high-performing trajectories by encouraging high $Q$-values in corresponding regions of the state space. Experiments across $5$ continuous control domains suggest that MCAC can be used to significantly increase learning efficiency across $6$ commonly used RL and RL-from-demonstrations algorithms.

**Abstract:** We study a game between liquidity provider and liquidity taker agents interacting in an over-the-counter market, for which the typical example is foreign exchange. We show how a suitable design of parameterized families of reward functions coupled with associated shared policy learning constitutes an efficient solution to this problem. Precisely, we show that our deep-reinforcement-learning-driven agents learn emergent behaviors relative to a wide spectrum of incentives encompassing profit-and-loss, optimal execution and market share, by playing against each other. In particular, we find that liquidity providers naturally learn to balance hedging and skewing as a function of their incentives, where the latter refers to setting their buy and sell prices asymmetrically as a function of their inventory. We further introduce a novel RL-based calibration algorithm which we found performed well at imposing constraints on the game equilibrium, both on toy and real market data.

**Abstract:** AI researchers have posited Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) as a challenge problem to test systems on various language-related capabilities. In this paper, we frame D&D specifically as a dialogue system challenge, where the tasks are to both generate the next conversational turn in the game and predict the state of the game given the dialogue history. We create a gameplay dataset consisting of nearly 900 games, with a total of 7,000 players, 800,000 dialogue turns, 500,000 dice rolls, and 58 million words. We automatically annotate the data with partial state information about the game play. We train a large language model (LM) to generate the next game turn, conditioning it on different information. The LM can respond as a particular character or as the player who runs the game--i.e., the Dungeon Master (DM). It is trained to produce dialogue that is either in-character (roleplaying in the fictional world) or out-of-character (discussing rules or strategy). We perform a human evaluation to determine what factors make the generated output plausible and interesting. We further perform an automatic evaluation to determine how well the model can predict the game state given the history and examine how well tracking the game state improves its ability to produce plausible conversational output.

<p>

**Abstract:** The objective of this paper is audio-visual synchronisation of general videos 'in the wild'. For such videos, the events that may be harnessed for synchronisation cues may be spatially small and may occur only infrequently during a many seconds-long video clip, i.e. the synchronisation signal is 'sparse in space and time'. This contrasts with the case of synchronising videos of talking heads, where audio-visual correspondence is dense in both time and space.
  We make four contributions: (i) in order to handle longer temporal sequences required for sparse synchronisation signals, we design a multi-modal transformer model that employs 'selectors' to distil the long audio and visual streams into small sequences that are then used to predict the temporal offset between streams. (ii) We identify artefacts that can arise from the compression codecs used for audio and video and can be used by audio-visual models in training to artificially solve the synchronisation task. (iii) We curate a dataset with only sparse in time and space synchronisation signals; and (iv) the effectiveness of the proposed model is shown on both dense and sparse datasets quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract:** Succinct representation of complex signals using coordinate-based neural representations (CNRs) has seen great progress, and several recent efforts focus on extending them for handling videos. Here, the main challenge is how to (a) alleviate a compute-inefficiency in training CNRs to (b) achieve high-quality video encoding while (c) maintaining the parameter-efficiency. To meet all requirements (a), (b), and (c) simultaneously, we propose neural video representations with learnable positional features (NVP), a novel CNR by introducing "learnable positional features" that effectively amortize a video as latent codes. Specifically, we first present a CNR architecture based on designing 2D latent keyframes to learn the common video contents across each spatio-temporal axis, which dramatically improves all of those three requirements. Then, we propose to utilize existing powerful image and video codecs as a compute-/memory-efficient compression procedure of latent codes. We demonstrate the superiority of NVP on the popular UVG benchmark; compared with prior arts, NVP not only trains 2 times faster (less than 5 minutes) but also exceeds their encoding quality as 34.07$\rightarrow$34.57 (measured with the PSNR metric), even using $>$8 times fewer parameters. We also show intriguing properties of NVP, e.g., video inpainting, video frame interpolation, etc.

**Abstract:** Entity Linking (EL) is the gateway into Knowledge Bases. Recent advances in EL utilize dense retrieval approaches for Candidate Generation, which addresses some of the shortcomings of the Lookup based approach of matching NER mentions against pre-computed dictionaries. In this work, we show that in the domain of Tweets, such methods suffer as users often include informal spelling, limited context, and lack of specificity, among other issues. We investigate these challenges on a large and recent Tweets benchmark for EL, empirically evaluate lookup and dense retrieval approaches, and demonstrate a hybrid solution using long contextual representation from Wikipedia is necessary to achieve considerable gains over previous work, achieving 0.93 recall.

**Abstract:** Bayesian model comparison (BMC) offers a principled probabilistic approach to study and rank competing models. In standard BMC, we construct a discrete probability distribution over the set of possible models, conditional on the observed data of interest. These posterior model probabilities (PMPs) are measures of uncertainty, but, when derived from a finite number of observations, are also uncertain themselves. In this paper, we conceptualize distinct levels of uncertainty which arise in BMC. We explore a fully probabilistic framework for quantifying meta-uncertainty, resulting in an applied method to enhance any BMC workflow. Drawing on both Bayesian and frequentist techniques, we represent the uncertainty over the uncertain PMPs via meta-models which combine simulated and observed data into a predictive distribution for PMPs on new data. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in the context of conjugate Bayesian regression, likelihood-based inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo, and simulation-based inference with neural networks.

**Abstract:** Prompt tuning, a parameter- and data-efficient transfer learning paradigm that tunes only a small number of parameters in a model's input space, has become a trend in the vision community since the emergence of large vision-language models like CLIP. We present a systematic study on two representative prompt tuning methods, namely text prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning. A major finding is that none of the unimodal prompt tuning methods performs consistently well: text prompt tuning fails on data with high intra-class visual variances while visual prompt tuning cannot handle low inter-class variances. To combine the best from both worlds, we propose a simple approach called Unified Prompt Tuning (UPT), which essentially learns a tiny neural network to jointly optimize prompts across different modalities. Extensive experiments on over 11 vision datasets show that UPT achieves a better trade-off than the unimodal counterparts on few-shot learning benchmarks, as well as on domain generalization benchmarks. Code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

**Abstract:** We propose a new task to benchmark scene understanding of embodied agents: Situated Question Answering in 3D Scenes (SQA3D). Given a scene context (e.g., 3D scan), SQA3D requires the tested agent to first understand its situation (position, orientation, etc.) in the 3D scene as described by text, then reason about its surrounding environment and answer a question under that situation. Based upon 650 scenes from ScanNet, we provide a dataset centered around 6.8k unique situations, along with 20.4k descriptions and 33.4k diverse reasoning questions for these situations. These questions examine a wide spectrum of reasoning capabilities for an intelligent agent, ranging from spatial relation comprehension to commonsense understanding, navigation, and multi-hop reasoning. SQA3D imposes a significant challenge to current multi-modal especially 3D reasoning models. We evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches and find that the best one only achieves an overall score of 47.20%, while amateur human participants can reach 90.06%. We believe SQA3D could facilitate future embodied AI research with stronger situation understanding and reasoning capability.

**Abstract:** Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital to safety-critical machine learning applications and has thus been extensively studied, with a plethora of methods developed in the literature. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often results in unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. From the problem setting perspective, OOD detection is closely related to neighboring fields including anomaly detection (AD), open set recognition (OSR), and model uncertainty, since methods developed for one domain are often applicable to each other. To help the community to improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called OpenOOD, which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and provides a comprehensive benchmark under the recently proposed generalized OOD detection framework. With a comprehensive comparison of these methods, we are gratified that the field has progressed significantly over the past few years, where both preprocessing methods and the orthogonal post-hoc methods show strong potential.

**Abstract:** Large NLP models have recently shown impressive performance in language understanding tasks, typically evaluated by their fine-tuned performance. Alternatively, probing has received increasing attention as being a lightweight method for interpreting the intrinsic mechanisms of large NLP models. In probing, post-hoc classifiers are trained on "out-of-domain" datasets that diagnose specific abilities. While probing the language models has led to insightful findings, they appear disjointed from the development of models. This paper explores the utility of probing deep NLP models to extract a proxy signal widely used in model development -- the fine-tuning performance. We find that it is possible to use the accuracies of only three probing tests to predict the fine-tuning performance with errors $40\%$ - $80\%$ smaller than baselines. We further discuss possible avenues where probing can empower the development of deep NLP models.

**Abstract:** Hypergraph neural networks can model multi-way connections among nodes of the graphs, which are common in real-world applications such as genetic medicine. In particular, genetic pathways or gene sets encode molecular functions driven by multiple genes, naturally represented as hyperedges. Thus, hypergraph-guided embedding can capture functional relations in learned representations. Existing hypergraph neural network models often focus on node-level or graph-level inference. There is an unmet need in learning powerful representations of subgraphs of hypergraphs in real-world applications. For example, a cancer patient can be viewed as a subgraph of genes harboring mutations in the patient, while all the genes are connected by hyperedges that correspond to pathways representing specific molecular functions. For accurate inductive subgraph prediction, we propose SubHypergraph Inductive Neural nEtwork (SHINE). SHINE uses informative genetic pathways that encode molecular functions as hyperedges to connect genes as nodes. SHINE jointly optimizes the objectives of end-to-end subgraph classification and hypergraph nodes' similarity regularization. SHINE simultaneously learns representations for both genes and pathways using strongly dual attention message passing. The learned representations are aggregated via a subgraph attention layer and used to train a multilayer perceptron for inductive subgraph inferencing. We evaluated SHINE against a wide array of state-of-the-art (hyper)graph neural networks, XGBoost, NMF and polygenic risk score models, using large scale NGS and curated datasets. SHINE outperformed all comparison models significantly, and yielded interpretable disease models with functional insights.

**Abstract:** While the Turkish language is listed among low-resource languages, literature on Turkish automatic speech recognition (ASR) is relatively old. In this paper, we present HuBERT-TR, a speech representation model for Turkish based on HuBERT. HuBERT-TR achieves state-of-the-art results on several Turkish ASR datasets. We investigate pre-training HuBERT for Turkish with large-scale data curated from online resources. We pre-train HuBERT-TR using over 6,500 hours of speech data curated from YouTube that includes extensive variability in terms of quality and genre. We show that pre-trained models within a multi-lingual setup are inferior to language-specific models, where our Turkish model HuBERT-TR base performs better than its x10 times larger multi-lingual counterpart XLS-R-1B. Moreover, we study the effect of scaling on ASR performance by scaling our models up to 1B parameters. Our best model yields a state-of-the-art word error rate of 4.97% on the Turkish Broadcast News dataset. Models are available at huggingface.co/asafaya .

**Abstract:** Fair representation learning (FRL) is a popular class of methods aiming to produce fair classifiers via data preprocessing. However, recent work has shown that prior methods achieve worse accuracy-fairness tradeoffs than originally suggested by their results. This dictates the need for FRL methods that provide provable upper bounds on unfairness of any downstream classifier, a challenge yet unsolved. In this work we address this challenge and propose Fairness with Restricted Encoders (FARE), the first FRL method with provable fairness guarantees. Our key insight is that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables us to derive suitable fairness guarantees, while allowing empirical accuracy-fairness tradeoffs comparable to prior work. FARE instantiates this idea with a tree-based encoder, a choice motivated by inherent advantages of decision trees when applied in our setting. Crucially, we develop and apply a practical statistical procedure that computes a high-confidence upper bound on the unfairness of any downstream classifier. In our experimental evaluation on several datasets and settings we demonstrate that FARE produces tight upper bounds, often comparable with empirical results of prior methods, which establishes the practical value of our approach.

**Abstract:** The field of deep clustering combines deep learning and clustering to learn representations that improve both the learned representation and the performance of the considered clustering method. Most existing deep clustering methods are designed for a single clustering method, e.g., k-means, spectral clustering, or Gaussian mixture models, but it is well known that no clustering algorithm works best in all circumstances. Consensus clustering tries to alleviate the individual weaknesses of clustering algorithms by building a consensus between members of a clustering ensemble. Currently, there is no deep clustering method that can include multiple heterogeneous clustering algorithms in an ensemble to update representations and clusterings together. To close this gap, we introduce the idea of a consensus representation that maximizes the agreement between ensemble members. Further, we propose DECCS (Deep Embedded Clustering with Consensus representationS), a deep consensus clustering method that learns a consensus representation by enhancing the embedded space to such a degree that all ensemble members agree on a common clustering result. Our contributions are the following: (1) We introduce the idea of learning consensus representations for heterogeneous clusterings, a novel notion to approach consensus clustering. (2) We propose DECCS, the first deep clustering method that jointly improves the representation and clustering results of multiple heterogeneous clustering algorithms. (3) We show in experiments that learning a consensus representation with DECCS is outperforming several relevant baselines from deep clustering and consensus clustering.

**Abstract:** A critical component of a successful language generation pipeline is the decoding algorithm. However, the general principles that should guide the choice of decoding algorithm remain unclear. Previous works only compare decoding algorithms in narrow scenarios and their findings do not generalize across tasks. To better structure the discussion, we introduce a taxonomy that groups decoding strategies based on their implicit assumptions about how well the model's likelihood is aligned with the task-specific notion of utility. We argue that this taxonomy allows a broader view of the decoding problem and can lead to generalizable statements because it is grounded on the interplay between the decoding algorithms and the likelihood-utility misalignment. Specifically, by analyzing the correlation between the likelihood and the utility of predictions across a diverse set of tasks, we provide the first empirical evidence supporting the proposed taxonomy, and a set of principles to structure reasoning when choosing a decoding algorithm. Crucially, our analysis is the first one to relate likelihood-based decoding strategies with strategies that rely on external information such as value-guided methods and prompting, and covers the most diverse set of tasks up-to-date.

**Abstract:** Large pre-trained models have proved to be remarkable zero- and (prompt-based) few-shot learners in unimodal vision and language tasks. We propose MAPL, a simple and parameter-efficient method that reuses frozen pre-trained unimodal models and leverages their strong generalization capabilities in multimodal vision-language (VL) settings. MAPL learns a lightweight mapping between the representation spaces of unimodal models using aligned image-text data, and can generalize to unseen VL tasks from just a few in-context examples. The small number of trainable parameters makes MAPL effective at low-data and in-domain learning. Moreover, MAPL's modularity enables easy extension to other pre-trained models. Extensive experiments on several visual question answering and image captioning benchmarks show that MAPL achieves superior or competitive performance compared to similar methods while training orders of magnitude fewer parameters. MAPL can be trained in just a few hours using modest computational resources and public datasets. We plan to release the code and pre-trained models.

**Abstract:** The implicit biases of gradient-based optimization algorithms are conjectured to be a major factor in the success of modern deep learning. In this work, we investigate the implicit bias of gradient flow and gradient descent in two-layer fully-connected neural networks with leaky ReLU activations when the training data are nearly-orthogonal, a common property of high-dimensional data. For gradient flow, we leverage recent work on the implicit bias for homogeneous neural networks to show that asymptotically, gradient flow produces a neural network with rank at most two. Moreover, this network is an $\ell_2$-max-margin solution (in parameter space), and has a linear decision boundary that corresponds to an approximate-max-margin linear predictor. For gradient descent, provided the random initialization variance is small enough, we show that a single step of gradient descent suffices to drastically reduce the rank of the network, and that the rank remains small throughout training. We provide experiments which suggest that a small initialization scale is important for finding low-rank neural networks with gradient descent.

**Abstract:** In this study, we propose a digital over-the-air computation (OAC) scheme for achieving continuous-valued (analog) aggregation for federated edge learning (FEEL). We show that the average of a set of real-valued parameters can be calculated approximately by using the average of the corresponding numerals, where the numerals are obtained based on a balanced number system. By exploiting this key property, the proposed scheme encodes the local stochastic gradients into a set of numerals. Next, it determines the positions of the activated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers by using the values of the numerals. To eliminate the need for precise sample-level time synchronization, channel estimation overhead, and channel inversion, the proposed scheme also uses a non-coherent receiver at the edge server (ES) and does not utilize a pre-equalization at the edge devices (EDs). We theoretically analyze the MSE performance of the proposed scheme and the convergence rate for a non-convex loss function. To improve the test accuracy of FEEL with the proposed scheme, we introduce the concept of adaptive absolute maximum (AAM). Our numerical results show that when the proposed scheme is used with AAM for FEEL, the test accuracy can reach up to 98% for heterogeneous data distribution.

**Abstract:** Diffusion models emerge to establish the new state of the art in the visual generation. In particular, text-to-image diffusion models that generate images based on caption descriptions have attracted increasing attention, impressed by their user controllability. Despite encouraging performance, they exaggerate concerns of fake image misuse and cast new pressures on fake image detection. In this work, we pioneer a systematic study of the authenticity of fake images generated by text-to-image diffusion models. In particular, we conduct comprehensive studies from two perspectives unique to the text-to-image model, namely, visual modality and linguistic modality. For visual modality, we propose universal detection that demonstrates fake images of these text-to-image diffusion models share common cues, which enable us to distinguish them apart from real images. We then propose source attribution that reveals the uniqueness of the fingerprints held by each diffusion model, which can be used to attribute each fake image to its model source. A variety of ablation and analysis studies further interpret the improvements from each of our proposed methods. For linguistic modality, we delve deeper to comprehensively analyze the impacts of text captions (called prompt analysis) on the image authenticity of text-to-image diffusion models, and reason the impacts to the detection and attribution performance of fake images. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the natural properties of text-to-image diffusion models, and we appeal to our community's consideration on the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generators.

**Abstract:** Data augmentation is key to improving the generalization ability of deep learning models. Mixup is a simple and widely-used data augmentation technique that has proven effective in alleviating the problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Also, recent studies of saliency-aware Mixup in the image domain show that preserving discriminative parts is beneficial to improving the generalization performance. However, these Mixup-based data augmentations are underexplored in 3D vision, especially in point clouds. In this paper, we propose SageMix, a saliency-guided Mixup for point clouds to preserve salient local structures. Specifically, we extract salient regions from two point clouds and smoothly combine them into one continuous shape. With a simple sequential sampling by re-weighted saliency scores, SageMix preserves the local structure of salient regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing Mixup methods in various benchmark point cloud datasets. With PointNet++, our method achieves an accuracy gain of 2.6% and 4.0% over standard training in 3D Warehouse dataset (MN40) and ScanObjectNN, respectively. In addition to generalization performance, SageMix improves robustness and uncertainty calibration. Moreover, when adopting our method to various tasks including part segmentation and standard 2D image classification, our method achieves competitive performance.

**Abstract:** This paper presents a subsampling-task paradigm for data-driven task-specific experiment design (ED) and a novel method in populationwide supervised feature selection (FS). Optimal ED, the choice of sampling points under constraints of limited acquisition-time, arises in a wide variety of scientific and engineering contexts. However the continuous optimization used in classical approaches depend on a-priori parameter choices and challenging non-convex optimization landscapes. This paper proposes to replace this strategy with a subsampling-task paradigm, analogous to populationwide supervised FS. In particular, we introduce JOFSTO, which performs JOint Feature Selection and Task Optimization. JOFSTO jointly optimizes two coupled networks: one for feature scoring, which provides the ED, the other for execution of a downstream task or process. Unlike most FS problems, e.g. selecting protein expressions for classification, ED problems typically select from highly correlated globally informative candidates rather than seeking a small number of highly informative features among many uninformative features. JOFSTO's construction efficiently identifies potentially correlated, but effective subsets and returns a trained task network. We demonstrate the approach using parameter estimation and mapping problems in quantitative MRI, where economical ED is crucial for clinical application. Results from simulations and empirical data show the subsampling-task paradigm strongly outperforms classical ED, and within our paradigm, JOFSTO outperforms state-of-the-art supervised FS techniques. JOFSTO extends immediately to wider image-based ED problems and other scenarios where the design must be specified globally across large numbers of acquisitions. Code will be released.

**Abstract:** Controllable story generation is a challenging task in the field of NLP, which has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, most existing works generate a whole story conditioned on the appointed keywords or emotions, ignoring the psychological changes of the protagonist. Inspired by psychology theories, we introduce global psychological state chains, which include the needs and emotions of the protagonists, to help a story generation system create more controllable and well-planned stories. In this paper, we propose a Psychology-guIded Controllable Story Generation System (PICS) to generate stories that adhere to the given leading context and desired psychological state chains for the protagonist. Specifically, psychological state trackers are employed to memorize the protagonist's local psychological states to capture their inner temporal relationships. In addition, psychological state planners are adopted to gain the protagonist's global psychological states for story planning. Eventually, a psychology controller is designed to integrate the local and global psychological states into the story context representation for composing psychology-guided stories. Automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that PICS outperforms baselines, and each part of PICS shows effectiveness for writing stories with more consistent psychological changes.

**Abstract:** Understanding the growth and distribution of the prawns is critical for optimising the feed and harvest strategies. An inadequate understanding of prawn growth can lead to reduced financial gain, for example, crops are harvested too early. The key to maintaining a good understanding of prawn growth is frequent sampling. However, the most commonly adopted sampling practice, the cast net approach, is unable to sample the prawns at a high frequency as it is expensive and laborious. An alternative approach is to sample prawns from feed trays that farm workers inspect each day. This will allow growth data collection at a high frequency (each day). But measuring prawns manually each day is a laborious task. In this article, we propose a new approach that utilises smart glasses, depth camera, computer vision and machine learning to detect prawn distribution and growth from feed trays. A smart headset was built to allow farmers to collect prawn data while performing daily feed tray checks. A computer vision + machine learning pipeline was developed and demonstrated to detect the growth trends of prawns in 4 prawn ponds over a growing season.

**Abstract:** While unsupervised skill discovery has shown promise in autonomously acquiring behavioral primitives, there is still a large methodological disconnect between task-agnostic skill pretraining and downstream, task-aware finetuning. We present Intrinsic Reward Matching (IRM), which unifies these two phases of learning via the $\textit{skill discriminator}$, a pretraining model component often discarded during finetuning. Conventional approaches finetune pretrained agents directly at the policy level, often relying on expensive environment rollouts to empirically determine the optimal skill. However, often the most concise yet complete description of a task is the reward function itself, and skill learning methods learn an $\textit{intrinsic}$ reward function via the discriminator that corresponds to the skill policy. We propose to leverage the skill discriminator to $\textit{match}$ the intrinsic and downstream task rewards and determine the optimal skill for an unseen task without environment samples, consequently finetuning with greater sample-efficiency. Furthermore, we generalize IRM to sequence skills and solve more complex, long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate that IRM is competitive with previous skill selection methods on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning Benchmark and enables us to utilize pretrained skills far more effectively on challenging tabletop manipulation tasks.

**Abstract:** The automation of the medical evidence acquisition and diagnosis process has recently attracted increasing attention in order to reduce the workload of doctors and democratize access to medical care. However, most works proposed in the machine learning literature focus solely on improving the prediction accuracy of a patient's pathology. We argue that this objective is insufficient to ensure doctors' acceptability of such systems. In their initial interaction with patients, doctors do not only focus on identifying the pathology a patient is suffering from; they instead generate a differential diagnosis (in the form of a short list of plausible diseases) because the medical evidence collected from patients is often insufficient to establish a final diagnosis. Moreover, doctors explicitly explore severe pathologies before potentially ruling them out from the differential, especially in acute care settings. Finally, for doctors to trust a system's recommendations, they need to understand how the gathered evidences led to the predicted diseases. In particular, interactions between a system and a patient need to emulate the reasoning of doctors. We therefore propose to model the evidence acquisition and automatic diagnosis tasks using a deep reinforcement learning framework that considers three essential aspects of a doctor's reasoning, namely generating a differential diagnosis using an exploration-confirmation approach while prioritizing severe pathologies. We propose metrics for evaluating interaction quality based on these three aspects. We show that our approach performs better than existing models while maintaining competitive pathology prediction accuracy.

**Abstract:** Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown promising performance on a variety of recognition tasks using the standard zero-shot classification procedure -- computing similarity between the query image and the embedded words for each category. By only using the category name, they neglect to make use of the rich context of additional information that language affords. The procedure gives no intermediate understanding of why a category is chosen, and furthermore provides no mechanism for adjusting the criteria used towards this decision. We present an alternative framework for classification with VLMs, which we call classification by description. We ask VLMs to check for descriptive features rather than broad categories: to find a tiger, look for its stripes; its claws; and more. By basing decisions on these descriptors, we can provide additional cues that encourage using the features we want to be used. In the process, we can get a clear idea of what features the model uses to construct its decision; it gains some level of inherent explainability. We query large language models (e.g., GPT-3) for these descriptors to obtain them in a scalable way. Extensive experiments show our framework has numerous advantages past interpretability. We show improvements in accuracy on ImageNet across distribution shifts; demonstrate the ability to adapt VLMs to recognize concepts unseen during training; and illustrate how descriptors can be edited to effectively mitigate bias compared to the baseline.

**Abstract:** In open-retrieval conversational machine reading (OR-CMR) task, machines are required to do multi-turn question answering given dialogue history and a textual knowledge base. Existing works generally utilize two independent modules to approach this problem's two successive sub-tasks: first with a hard-label decision making and second with a question generation aided by various entailment reasoning methods. Such usual cascaded modeling is vulnerable to error propagation and prevents the two sub-tasks from being consistently optimized. In this work, we instead model OR-CMR as a unified text-to-text task in a fully end-to-end style. Experiments on the OR-ShARC dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed end-to-end framework on both sub-tasks by a large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Further ablation studies support that our framework can generalize to different backbone models.

**Abstract:** Specular microscopy assessment of the human corneal endothelium (CE) in Fuchs' dystrophy is challenging due to the presence of dark image regions called guttae. This paper proposes a UNet-based segmentation approach that requires minimal post-processing and achieves reliable CE morphometric assessment and guttae identification across all degrees of Fuchs' dystrophy. We cast the segmentation problem as a regression task of the cell and gutta signed distance maps instead of a pixel-level classification task as typically done with UNets. Compared to the conventional UNet classification approach, the distance-map regression approach converges faster in clinically relevant parameters. It also produces morphometric parameters that agree with the manually-segmented ground-truth data, namely the average cell density difference of -41.9 cells/mm2 (95% confidence interval (CI) [-306.2, 222.5]) and the average difference of mean cell area of 14.8 um2 (95% CI [-41.9, 71.5]). These results suggest a promising alternative for CE assessment.

**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved the state-of-the-art performance in medical image segmentation due to their ability to extract highly complex feature representations. However, it is argued in recent studies that traditional CNNs lack the intelligence to capture long-term dependencies of different image regions. Following the success of applying Transformer models on natural language processing tasks, the medical image segmentation field has also witnessed growing interest in utilizing Transformers, due to their ability to capture long-range contextual information. However, unlike CNNs, Transformers lack the ability to learn local feature representations. Thus, to fully utilize the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder segmentation model (ConvTransSeg). It consists of a multi-layer CNN as the encoder for feature learning and the corresponding multi-level Transformer as the decoder for segmentation prediction. The encoder and decoder are interconnected in a multi-resolution manner. We compared our method with many other state-of-the-art hybrid CNN and Transformer segmentation models on binary and multiple class image segmentation tasks using several public medical image datasets, including skin lesion, polyp, cell and brain tissue. The experimental results show that our method achieves overall the best performance in terms of Dice coefficient and average symmetric surface distance measures with low model complexity and memory consumption. In contrast to most Transformer-based methods that we compared, our method does not require the use of pre-trained models to achieve similar or better performance. The code is freely available for research purposes on Github: (the link will be added upon acceptance).

**Abstract:** Recently, auto-bidding technique has become an essential tool to increase the revenue of advertisers. Facing the complex and ever-changing bidding environments in the real-world advertising system (RAS), state-of-the-art auto-bidding policies usually leverage reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to generate real-time bids on behalf of the advertisers. Due to safety concerns, it was believed that the RL training process can only be carried out in an offline virtual advertising system (VAS) that is built based on the historical data generated in the RAS. In this paper, we argue that there exists significant gaps between the VAS and RAS, making the RL training process suffer from the problem of inconsistency between online and offline (IBOO). Firstly, we formally define the IBOO and systematically analyze its causes and influences. Then, to avoid the IBOO, we propose a sustainable online RL (SORL) framework that trains the auto-bidding policy by directly interacting with the RAS, instead of learning in the VAS. Specifically, based on our proof of the Lipschitz smooth property of the Q function, we design a safe and efficient online exploration (SER) policy for continuously collecting data from the RAS. Meanwhile, we derive the theoretical lower bound on the safety of the SER policy. We also develop a variance-suppressed conservative Q-learning (V-CQL) method to effectively and stably learn the auto-bidding policy with the collected data. Finally, extensive simulated and real-world experiments validate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art auto-bidding algorithm.

**Abstract:** The presence and density of specific types of immune cells are important to understand a patient's immune response to cancer. However, immunofluorescence staining required to identify T cell subtypes is expensive, time-consuming, and rarely performed in clinical settings. We present a framework to virtually stain Hoechst images (which are cheap and widespread) with both CD3 and CD8 to identify T cell subtypes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using generative adversarial networks. Our proposed method jointly learns both staining tasks, incentivising the network to incorporate mutually beneficial information from each task. We devise a novel metric to quantify the virtual staining quality, and use it to evaluate our method.

**Abstract:** We consider a decluttering problem where multiple rigid convex polygonal objects rest in randomly placed positions and orientations on a planar surface and must be efficiently transported to a packing box using both single and multi-object grasps. Prior work considered frictionless multi-object grasping. In this paper, we introduce friction to increase picks per hour. We train a neural network using real examples to plan robust multi-object grasps. In physical experiments, we find an 11.7% increase in success rates, a 1.7x increase in picks per hour, and an 8.2x decrease in grasp planning time compared to prior work on multi-object grasping.

**Abstract:** A successful paradigm in representation learning is to perform self-supervised pretraining using tasks based on mini-batch statistics (e.g., SimCLR, VICReg, SwAV, MSN). We show that in the formulation of all these methods is an overlooked prior to learn features that enable uniform clustering of the data. While this prior has led to remarkably semantic representations when pretraining on class-balanced data, such as ImageNet, we demonstrate that it can hamper performance when pretraining on class-imbalanced data. By moving away from conventional uniformity priors and instead preferring power-law distributed feature clusters, we show that one can improve the quality of the learned representations on real-world class-imbalanced datasets. To demonstrate this, we develop an extension of the Masked Siamese Networks (MSN) method to support the use of arbitrary features priors.

**Abstract:** While instance-level explanation of GNN is a well-studied problem with plenty of approaches being developed, providing a global explanation for the behaviour of a GNN is much less explored, despite its potential in interpretability and debugging. Existing solutions either simply list local explanations for a given class, or generate a synthetic prototypical graph with maximal score for a given class, completely missing any combinatorial aspect that the GNN could have learned. In this work, we propose GLGExplainer (Global Logic-based GNN Explainer), the first Global Explainer capable of generating explanations as arbitrary Boolean combinations of learned graphical concepts. GLGExplainer is a fully differentiable architecture that takes local explanations as inputs and combines them into a logic formula over graphical concepts, represented as clusters of local explanations. Contrary to existing solutions, GLGExplainer provides accurate and human-interpretable global explanations that are perfectly aligned with ground-truth explanations (on synthetic data) or match existing domain knowledge (on real-world data). Extracted formulas are faithful to the model predictions, to the point of providing insights into some occasionally incorrect rules learned by the model, making GLGExplainer a promising diagnostic tool for learned GNNs.

**Abstract:** In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in a large number of tasks in computer vision. One of them is object detection for autonomous driving. Although CNNs are used widely in many areas, what happens inside the network is still unexplained on many levels. Our goal is to determine the effect of Intrinsic dimension (i.e. minimum number of parameters required to represent data) in different layers on the accuracy of object detection network for augmented data sets. Our investigation determines that there is difference between the representation of normal and augmented data during feature extraction.

**Abstract:** We present SELOR, a framework for integrating self-explaining capabilities into a given deep model to achieve both high prediction performance and human precision. By "human precision", we refer to the degree to which humans agree with the reasons models provide for their predictions. Human precision affects user trust and allows users to collaborate closely with the model. We demonstrate that logic rule explanations naturally satisfy human precision with the expressive power required for good predictive performance. We then illustrate how to enable a deep model to predict and explain with logic rules. Our method does not require predefined logic rule sets or human annotations and can be learned efficiently and easily with widely-used deep learning modules in a differentiable way. Extensive experiments show that our method gives explanations closer to human decision logic than other methods while maintaining the performance of deep learning models.

**Abstract:** Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging modality that provides unique insights into the dynamics of proteins and other building blocks of life. The algorithmic challenge of jointly estimating the poses, 3D structure, and conformational heterogeneity of a biomolecule from millions of noisy and randomly oriented 2D projections in a computationally efficient manner, however, remains unsolved. Our method, cryoFIRE, performs ab initio heterogeneous reconstruction with unknown poses in an amortized framework, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive step of pose search while enabling the analysis of conformational heterogeneity. Poses and conformation are jointly estimated by an encoder while a physics-based decoder aggregates the images into an implicit neural representation of the conformational space. We show that our method can provide one order of magnitude speedup on datasets containing millions of images without any loss of accuracy. We validate that the joint estimation of poses and conformations can be amortized over the size of the dataset. For the first time, we prove that an amortized method can extract interpretable dynamic information from experimental datasets.

**Abstract:** Calibration means that forecasts and average realized frequencies are close. We develop the concept of forecast hedging, which consists of choosing the forecasts so as to guarantee that the expected track record can only improve. This yields all the calibration results by the same simple basic argument while differentiating between them by the forecast-hedging tools used: deterministic and fixed point based versus stochastic and minimax based. Additional contributions are an improved definition of continuous calibration, ensuing game dynamics that yield Nash equilibria in the long run, and a new calibrated forecasting procedure for binary events that is simpler than all known such procedures.

**Abstract:** We propose to smooth out the calibration score, which measures how good a forecaster is, by combining nearby forecasts. While regular calibration can be guaranteed only by randomized forecasting procedures, we show that smooth calibration can be guaranteed by deterministic procedures. As a consequence, it does not matter if the forecasts are leaked, i.e., made known in advance: smooth calibration can nevertheless be guaranteed (while regular calibration cannot). Moreover, our procedure has finite recall, is stationary, and all forecasts lie on a finite grid. To construct the procedure, we deal also with the related setups of online linear regression and weak calibration. Finally, we show that smooth calibration yields uncoupled finite-memory dynamics in n-person games "smooth calibrated learning" in which the players play approximate  Nash equilibria in almost all periods (by contrast, calibrated learning, which uses regular calibration, yields only that the time-averages of play are approximate correlated equilibria).

**Abstract:** We address the general task of structured commonsense reasoning: given a natural language input, the goal is to generate a graph such as an event -- or a reasoning-graph. To employ large language models (LMs) for this task, existing approaches ``serialize'' the output graph as a flat list of nodes and edges. Although feasible, these serialized graphs strongly deviate from the natural language corpora that LMs were pre-trained on, hindering LMs from generating them correctly. In this paper, we show that when we instead frame structured commonsense reasoning tasks as code generation tasks, pre-trained LMs of code are better structured commonsense reasoners than LMs of natural language, even when the downstream task does not involve source code at all. We demonstrate our approach across three diverse structured commonsense reasoning tasks. In all these natural language tasks, we show that using our approach, a code generation LM (CODEX) outperforms natural-LMs that are fine-tuned on the target task (e.g., T5) and other strong LMs such as GPT-3 in the few-shot setting.

**Abstract:** The importance of explainability is increasingly acknowledged in natural language processing. However, it is still unclear how the quality of explanations can be assessed effectively. The predominant approach is to compare proxy scores (such as BLEU or explanation F1) evaluated against gold explanations in the dataset. The assumption is that an increase of the proxy score implies a higher utility of explanations to users. In this paper, we question this assumption. In particular, we (i) formulate desired characteristics of explanation quality that apply across tasks and domains, (ii) point out how current evaluation practices violate those characteristics, and (iii) propose actionable guidelines to overcome obstacles that limit today's evaluation of explanation quality and to enable the development of explainable systems that provide tangible benefits for human users. We substantiate our theoretical claims (i.e., the lack of validity and temporal decline of currently-used proxy scores) with empirical evidence from a crowdsourcing case study in which we investigate the explanation quality of state-of-the-art explainable question answering systems.

**Abstract:** A bottleneck to developing Semantic Parsing (SP) models is the need for a large volume of human-labeled training data. Given the complexity and cost of human annotation for SP, labeled data is often scarce, particularly in multilingual settings. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at SP given only a few examples, however LLMs are unsuitable for runtime systems which require low latency. In this work, we propose CLASP, a simple method to improve low-resource SP for moderate-sized models: we generate synthetic data from AlexaTM 20B to augment the training set for a model 40x smaller (500M parameters). We evaluate on two datasets in low-resource settings: English PIZZA, containing either 348 or 16 real examples, and mTOP cross-lingual zero-shot, where training data is available only in English, and the model must generalize to four new languages. On both datasets, we show significant improvements over strong baseline methods.

**Abstract:** Due to the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and the technological advancement of EV electronics, the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technique and large-scale scheduling algorithms have been developed to achieve a high level of renewable energy and power grid stability. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for the continuous charging/discharging coordination strategy in aggregating large-scale EVs in V2G mode with renewable energy sources (RES). The DRL coordination strategy can efficiently optimize the electric vehicle aggregator's (EVA's) real-time charging/discharging power with the state of charge (SOC) constraints of the EVA and the individual EV. Compared with uncontrolled charging, the load variance is reduced by 97.37$\%$ and the charging cost by 76.56$\%$. The DRL coordination strategy further demonstrates outstanding transfer learning ability to microgrids with RES and large-scale EVA, as well as the complicated weekly scheduling. The DRL coordination strategy demonstrates flexible, adaptable, and scalable performance for the large-scale V2G under realistic operating conditions.

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a prevailing tool for learning physical dynamics. However, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Physical laws abide by symmetry, which is a vital inductive bias accounting for model generalization and should be incorporated into the model design. Existing simulators either consider insufficient symmetry, or enforce excessive equivariance in practice when symmetry is partially broken by gravity. 2) Objects in the physical world possess diverse shapes, sizes, and properties, which should be appropriately processed by the model. To tackle these difficulties, we propose a novel backbone, Subequivariant Graph Neural Network, which 1) relaxes equivariance to subequivariance by considering external fields like gravity, where the universal approximation ability holds theoretically; 2) introduces a new subequivariant object-aware message passing for learning physical interactions between multiple objects of various shapes in the particle-based representation; 3) operates in a hierarchical fashion, allowing for modeling long-range and complex interactions. Our model achieves on average over 3% enhancement in contact prediction accuracy across 8 scenarios on Physion and 2X lower rollout MSE on RigidFall compared with state-of-the-art GNN simulators, while exhibiting strong generalization and data efficiency.

**Abstract:** Despite tremendous progress in natural language processing using deep learning techniques in recent years, sign language production and comprehension has advanced very little. One critical barrier is the lack of largescale datasets available to the public due to the unbearable cost of labeled data generation. Efforts to provide public data for American Sign Language (ASL) comprehension have yielded two datasets, comprising more than thousand video clips. These datasets are large enough to enable a meaningful start to deep learning research on sign languages but are far too small to lead to any solution that can be practically deployed. So far, there is still no suitable dataset for ASL production. We proposed a system that can generate large scale ASL datasets for continuous ASL. It is suitable for general ASL processing and is particularly useful for ASL production. The continuous ASL dataset contains English labeled human articulations in condensed body pose data formats. To better serve the research community, we are releasing the first version of our ASL dataset, which contains 30k sentences, 416k words, a vocabulary of 18k words, in a total of 104 hours. This is the largest continuous sign language dataset published to date in terms of video duration. We also describe a system that can evolve and expand the dataset to incorporate better data processing techniques and more contents when available. It is our hope that the release of this ASL dataset and the sustainable dataset generation system to the public will propel better deep-learning research in ASL natural language processing.

**Abstract:** Open-Set Classification (OSC) intends to adapt closed-set classification models to real-world scenarios, where the classifier must correctly label samples of known classes while rejecting previously unseen unknown samples. Only recently, research started to investigate on algorithms that are able to handle these unknown samples correctly. Some of these approaches address OSC by including into the training set negative samples that a classifier learns to reject, expecting that these data increase the robustness of the classifier on unknown classes. Most of these approaches are evaluated on small-scale and low-resolution image datasets like MNIST, SVHN or CIFAR, which makes it difficult to assess their applicability to the real world, and to compare them among each other. We propose three open-set protocols that provide rich datasets of natural images with different levels of similarity between known and unknown classes. The protocols consist of subsets of ImageNet classes selected to provide training and testing data closer to real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a new validation metric that can be employed to assess whether the training of deep learning models addresses both the classification of known samples and the rejection of unknown samples. We use the protocols to compare the performance of two baseline open-set algorithms to the standard SoftMax baseline and find that the algorithms work well on negative samples that have been seen during training, and partially on out-of-distribution detection tasks, but drop performance in the presence of samples from previously unseen unknown classes.

**Abstract:** Decoding human visual neural representations is a challenging task with great scientific significance in revealing vision-processing mechanisms and developing brain-like intelligent machines. Most existing methods are difficult to generalize to novel categories that have no corresponding neural data for training. The two main reasons are 1) the under-exploitation of the multimodal semantic knowledge underlying the neural data and 2) the small number of paired (stimuli-responses) training data. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a generic neural decoding method called BraVL that uses multimodal learning of brain-visual-linguistic features. We focus on modeling the relationships between brain, visual and linguistic features via multimodal deep generative models. Specifically, we leverage the mixture-of-product-of-experts formulation to infer a latent code that enables a coherent joint generation of all three modalities. To learn a more consistent joint representation and improve the data efficiency in the case of limited brain activity data, we exploit both intra- and inter-modality mutual information maximization regularization terms. In particular, our BraVL model can be trained under various semi-supervised scenarios to incorporate the visual and textual features obtained from the extra categories. Finally, we construct three trimodal matching datasets, and the extensive experiments lead to some interesting conclusions and cognitive insights: 1) decoding novel visual categories from human brain activity is practically possible with good accuracy; 2) decoding models using the combination of visual and linguistic features perform much better than those using either of them alone; 3) visual perception may be accompanied by linguistic influences to represent the semantics of visual stimuli.

<p>

**Abstract:** We study the class of location-scale or heteroscedastic noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ can be written as a function of the cause $X$ and a noise source $N$ independent of $X$, which may be scaled by a positive function $g$ over the cause, i.e., $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$. Despite the generality of the model class, we show the causal direction is identifiable up to some pathological cases. To empirically validate these theoretical findings, we propose two estimators for LSNMs: an estimator based on (non-linear) feature maps, and one based on probabilistic neural networks. Both model the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ as a Gaussian parameterized by its natural parameters. Since the neural network approach can fit functions of arbitrary complexity, it has an edge over the feature map-based approach in terms of empirical performance. When the feature maps are correctly specified, however, we can prove that our estimator is jointly concave, which allows us to derive stronger guarantees for the cause-effect identification task.

**Abstract:** Modern quantum annealers can find high-quality solutions to combinatorial optimisation objectives given as quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) problems. Unfortunately, obtaining suitable QUBO forms in computer vision remains challenging and currently requires problem-specific analytical derivations. Moreover, such explicit formulations impose tangible constraints on solution encodings. In stark contrast to prior work, this paper proposes to learn QUBO forms from data through gradient backpropagation instead of deriving them. As a result, the solution encodings can be chosen flexibly and compactly. Furthermore, our methodology is general and virtually independent of the specifics of the target problem type. We demonstrate the advantages of learnt QUBOs on the diverse problem types of graph matching, 2D point cloud alignment and 3D rotation estimation. Our results are competitive with the previous quantum state of the art while requiring much fewer logical and physical qubits, enabling our method to scale to larger problems. The code and the new dataset will be open-sourced.

**Abstract:** Object-oriented reinforcement learning (OORL) is a promising way to improve the sample efficiency and generalization ability over standard RL. Recent works that try to solve OORL tasks without additional feature engineering mainly focus on learning the object representations and then solving tasks via reasoning based on these object representations. However, none of these works tries to explicitly model the inherent similarity between different object instances of the same category. Objects of the same category should share similar functionalities; therefore, the category is the most critical property of an object. Following this insight, we propose a novel framework named Object-Category Aware Reinforcement Learning (OCARL), which utilizes the category information of objects to facilitate both perception and reasoning. OCARL consists of three parts: (1) Category-Aware Unsupervised Object Discovery (UOD), which discovers the objects as well as their corresponding categories; (2) Object-Category Aware Perception, which encodes the category information and is also robust to the incompleteness of (1) at the same time; (3) Object-Centric Modular Reasoning, which adopts multiple independent and object-category-specific networks when reasoning based on objects. Our experiments show that OCARL can improve both the sample efficiency and generalization in the OORL domain.

We find that different frames have a profound effect on agent learning performance, and the trend is similar across 3D backbone networks. In particular, the end-effector frame and the target-part frame achieve higher training efficiency than the commonly used world frame and robot-base frame in many tasks, intuitively because they provide helpful alignments among point clouds across time steps and thus can simplify visual module learning. Moreover, the well-performing frames vary across tasks, and some tasks may benefit from multiple frame candidates. We thus propose FrameMiners to adaptively select candidate frames and fuse their merits in a task-agnostic manner. Experimentally, FrameMiners achieves on-par or significantly higher performance than the best single-frame version on five fully physical manipulation tasks adapted from ManiSkill and OCRTOC. Without changing existing camera placements or adding extra cameras, point cloud frame mining can serve as a free lunch to improve 3D manipulation learning.

**Abstract:** There are a multitude of emerging imaging technologies that could benefit robotics. However the need for bespoke models, calibration and low-level processing represents a key barrier to their adoption. In this work we present NOCaL, Neural odometry and Calibration using Light fields, a semi-supervised learning architecture capable of interpreting previously unseen cameras without calibration. NOCaL learns to estimate camera parameters, relative pose, and scene appearance. It employs a scene-rendering hypernetwork pretrained on a large number of existing cameras and scenes, and adapts to previously unseen cameras using a small supervised training set to enforce metric scale. We demonstrate NOCaL on rendered and captured imagery using conventional cameras, demonstrating calibration-free odometry and novel view synthesis. This work represents a key step toward automating the interpretation of general camera geometries and emerging imaging technologies.

**Abstract:** Calorimeter simulation is the most computationally expensive part of Monte Carlo generation of samples necessary for analysis of experimental data at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC would require an even larger amount of such samples. We present a technique based on Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAEs) to simulate particle showers in Electromagnetic Calorimeters. We discuss how this work paves the way towards exploration of quantum annealing processors as sampling devices for generation of simulated High Energy Physics datasets.

**Abstract:** Legal and ethical restrictions on accessing relevant data inhibit data science research in critical domains such as health, finance, and education. Synthetic data generation algorithms with privacy guarantees are emerging as a paradigm to break this data logjam. Existing approaches, however, assume that the data holders supply their raw data to a trusted curator, who uses it as fuel for synthetic data generation. This severely limits the applicability, as much of the valuable data in the world is locked up in silos, controlled by entities who cannot show their data to each other or a central aggregator without raising privacy concerns.
  To overcome this roadblock, we propose the first solution in which data holders only share encrypted data for differentially private synthetic data generation. Data holders send shares to servers who perform Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) computations while the original data stays encrypted.
  We instantiate this idea in an MPC protocol for the Multiplicative Weights with Exponential Mechanism (MWEM) algorithm to generate synthetic data based on real data originating from many data holders without reliance on a single point of failure.

**Abstract:** Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and accountability.

**Abstract:** Molecular discovery is a multi-objective optimization problem that requires identifying a molecule or set of molecules that balance multiple, often competing, properties. Multi-objective molecular design is commonly addressed by combining properties of interest into a single objective function using scalarization, which imposes assumptions about relative importance and uncovers little about the trade-offs between objectives. In contrast to scalarization, Pareto optimization does not require knowledge of relative importance and reveals the trade-offs between objectives. However, it introduces additional considerations in algorithm design. In this review, we describe pool-based and de novo generative approaches to multi-objective molecular discovery with a focus on Pareto optimization algorithms. We show how pool-based molecular discovery is a relatively direct extension of multi-objective Bayesian optimization and how the plethora of different generative models extend from single-objective to multi-objective optimization in similar ways using non-dominated sorting in the reward function (reinforcement learning) or to select molecules for retraining (distribution learning) or propagation (genetic algorithms). Finally, we discuss some remaining challenges and opportunities in the field, emphasizing the opportunity to adopt Bayesian optimization techniques into multi-objective de novo design.

**Abstract:** Learning the multivariate distribution of data is a core challenge in statistics and machine learning. Traditional methods aim for the probability density function (PDF) and are limited by the curse of dimensionality. Modern neural methods are mostly based on black-box models, lacking identifiability guarantees. In this work, we aim to learn multivariate cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), as they can handle mixed random variables, allow efficient box probability evaluation, and have the potential to overcome local sample scarcity owing to their cumulative nature. We show that any grid sampled version of a joint CDF of mixed random variables admits a universal representation as a naive Bayes model via the Canonical Polyadic (tensor-rank) decomposition. By introducing a low-rank model, either directly in the raw data domain, or indirectly in a transformed (Copula) domain, the resulting model affords efficient sampling, closed form inference and uncertainty quantification, and comes with uniqueness guarantees under relatively mild conditions. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in several synthetic and real datasets and applications including regression, sampling and data imputation. Interestingly, our experiments with real data show that it is possible to obtain better density/mass estimates indirectly via a low-rank CDF model, than a low-rank PDF/PMF model.

**Abstract:** Recent work on tokenizer-free multilingual pretrained models show promising results in improving cross-lingual transfer and reducing engineering overhead (Clark et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2022). However, these works mainly focus on reporting accuracy on a limited set of tasks and data settings, placing less emphasis on other important factors when tuning and deploying the models in practice, such as memory usage, inference speed, and fine-tuning data robustness. We attempt to fill this gap by performing a comprehensive empirical comparison of multilingual tokenizer-free and subword-based models considering these various dimensions. Surprisingly, we find that subword-based models might still be the most practical choice in many settings, achieving better performance for lower inference latency and memory usage. Based on these results, we encourage future work in tokenizer-free methods to consider these factors when designing and evaluating new models.

**Abstract:** The normalizing layer has become one of the basic configurations of deep learning models, but it still suffers from computational inefficiency, interpretability difficulties, and low generality. After gaining a deeper understanding of the recent normalization and normalizer-free research works from a sample's perspective, we reveal the fact that the problem lies in the sampling noise and the inappropriate prior assumption. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective alternative to normalization, which is called "NoMorelization". NoMorelization is composed of two trainable scalars and a zero-centered noise injector. Experimental results demonstrate that NoMorelization is a general component for deep learning and is suitable for different model paradigms (e.g., convolution-based and attention-based models) to tackle different tasks (e.g., discriminative and generative tasks). Compared with existing mainstream normalizers (e.g., BN, LN, and IN) and state-of-the-art normalizer-free methods, NoMorelization shows the best speed-accuracy trade-off.

**Abstract:** Adversarial training is exploited to develop a robust Deep Neural Network (DNN) model against the malicious altered data. These attacks may have catastrophic effects on DNN models but are indistinguishable for a human being. For example, an external attack can modify an image adding noises invisible for a human eye, but a DNN model misclassified the image. A key objective for developing robust DNN models is to use a learning algorithm that is fast but can also give model that is robust against different types of adversarial attacks. Especially for adversarial training, enormously long training times are needed for obtaining high accuracy under many different types of adversarial samples generated using different adversarial attack techniques.
  This paper aims at accelerating the adversarial training to enable fast development of robust DNN models against adversarial attacks. The general method for improving the training performance is the hyperparameters fine-tuning, where the learning rate is one of the most crucial hyperparameters. By modifying its shape (the value over time) and value during the training, we can obtain a model robust to adversarial attacks faster than standard training.
  First, we conduct experiments on two different datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100), exploring various techniques. Then, this analysis is leveraged to develop a novel fast training methodology, AccelAT, which automatically adjusts the learning rate for different epochs based on the accuracy gradient. The experiments show comparable results with the related works, and in several experiments, the adversarial training of DNNs using our AccelAT framework is conducted up to 2 times faster than the existing techniques. Thus, our findings boost the speed of adversarial training in an era in which security and performance are fundamental optimization objectives in DNN-based applications.

**Abstract:** Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is the most granular form of sentiment analysis that can be performed on the documents / sentences. Besides delivering the most insights at a finer grain, it also poses equally daunting challenges. One of them being the shortage of labelled data. To bring in value right out of the box for the text data being generated at a very fast pace in today's world, unsupervised aspect-based sentiment analysis allows us to generate insights without investing time or money in generating labels. From topic modelling approaches to recent deep learning-based aspect extraction models, this domain has seen a lot of development. One of the models that we improve upon is ABAE that reconstructs the sentences as a linear combination of aspect terms present in it, In this research we explore how we can use information from another unsupervised model to regularize ABAE, leading to better performance. We contrast it with baseline rule based ensemble and show that the ensemble methods work better than the individual models and the regularization based ensemble performs better than the rule-based one.

**Abstract:** Real-world data for classification is often labeled by multiple annotators. For analyzing such data, we introduce CROWDLAB, a straightforward approach to estimate: (1) A consensus label for each example that aggregates the individual annotations (more accurately than aggregation via majority-vote or other algorithms used in crowdsourcing); (2) A confidence score for how likely each consensus label is correct (via well-calibrated estimates that account for the number of annotations for each example and their agreement, prediction-confidence from a trained classifier, and trustworthiness of each annotator vs. the classifier); (3) A rating for each annotator quantifying the overall correctness of their labels. While many algorithms have been proposed to estimate related quantities in crowdsourcing, these often rely on sophisticated generative models with iterative inference schemes, whereas CROWDLAB is based on simple weighted ensembling. Many algorithms also rely solely on annotator statistics, ignoring the features of the examples from which the annotations derive. CROWDLAB in contrast utilizes any classifier model trained on these features, which can generalize between examples with similar features. In evaluations on real-world multi-annotator image data, our proposed method provides superior estimates for (1)-(3) than many alternative algorithms.

**Abstract:** Oriented object detection emerges in many applications from aerial images to autonomous driving, while many existing detection benchmarks are annotated with horizontal bounding box only which is also less costive than fine-grained rotated box, leading to a gap between the readily available training corpus and the rising demand for oriented object detection. This paper proposes a simple yet effective oriented object detection approach called H2RBox merely using horizontal box annotation for weakly-supervised training, which closes the above gap and shows competitive performance even against those trained with rotated boxes. The cores of our method are weakly- and self-supervised learning, which predicts the angle of the object by learning the consistency of two different views. To our best knowledge, H2RBox is the first horizontal box annotation-based oriented object detector. Compared to an alternative i.e. horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation with our post adaption to oriented object detection, our approach is not susceptible to the prediction quality of mask and can perform more robustly in complex scenes containing a large number of dense objects and outliers. Experimental results show that H2RBox has significant performance and speed advantages over horizontal box-supervised instance segmentation methods, as well as lower memory requirements. While compared to rotated box-supervised oriented object detectors, our method shows very close performance and speed, and even surpasses them in some cases.

**Abstract:** Increased biosecurity and food safety requirements may increase demand for efficient traceability and identification systems of livestock in the supply chain. The advanced technologies of machine learning and computer vision have been applied in precision livestock management, including critical disease detection, vaccination, production management, tracking, and health monitoring. This paper offers a systematic literature review (SLR) of vision-based cattle identification. More specifically, this SLR is to identify and analyse the research related to cattle identification using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). For the two main applications of cattle detection and cattle identification, all the ML based papers only solve cattle identification problems. However, both detection and identification problems were studied in the DL based papers. Based on our survey report, the most used ML models for cattle identification were support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), and artificial neural network (ANN). Convolutional neural network (CNN), residual network (ResNet), Inception, You Only Look Once (YOLO), and Faster R-CNN were popular DL models in the selected papers. Among these papers, the most distinguishing features were the muzzle prints and coat patterns of cattle. Local binary pattern (LBP), speeded up robust features (SURF), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and Inception or CNN were identified as the most used feature extraction methods.

**Abstract:** In recent years, the role of big data analytics has exponentially grown and is now slowly making its way into the education industry. Several attempts are being made in this sphere in order to improve the quality of education being provided to students and while many collaborations have been carried out before, automated scoring of answers has been explored to a rather limited extent. One of the biggest hurdles to choosing constructed-response assessments over multiple-choice assessments is the effort and large cost that comes with their evaluation and this is precisely the issue that this project aims to solve. The aim is to accept raw-input from the student in the form of their answer, preprocess the answer, and automatically score the answer. In addition, we have made this a real-time system that captures "snapshots" of the writer's progress with respect to the answer, allowing us to unearth trends with respect to the way a student thinks, and how the student has arrived at their final answer.

**Abstract:** Calibrated probabilistic classifiers are models whose predicted probabilities can directly be interpreted as uncertainty estimates. It has been shown recently that deep neural networks are poorly calibrated and tend to output overconfident predictions. As a remedy, we propose a low-bias, trainable calibration error estimator based on Dirichlet kernel density estimates, which asymptotically converges to the true $L_p$ calibration error. This novel estimator enables us to tackle the strongest notion of multiclass calibration, called canonical (or distribution) calibration, while other common calibration methods are tractable only for top-label and marginal calibration. The computational complexity of our estimator is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, the convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$, and it is unbiased up to $\mathcal{O}(n^{-2})$, achieved by a geometric series debiasing scheme. In practice, this means that the estimator can be applied to small subsets of data, enabling efficient estimation and mini-batch updates. The proposed method has a natural choice of kernel, and can be used to generate consistent estimates of other quantities based on conditional expectation, such as the sharpness of a probabilistic classifier. Empirical results validate the correctness of our estimator, and demonstrate its utility in canonical calibration error estimation and calibration error regularized risk minimization.

**Abstract:** This paper revisits the bandit problem in the Bayesian setting. The Bayesian approach formulates the bandit problem as an optimization problem, and the goal is to find the optimal policy which minimizes the Bayesian regret. One of the main challenges facing the Bayesian approach is that computation of the optimal policy is often intractable, especially when the length of the problem horizon or the number of arms is large. In this paper, we first show that under a suitable rescaling, the Bayesian bandit problem converges to a continuous Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The optimal policy for the limiting HJB equation can be explicitly obtained for several common bandit problems, and we give numerical methods to solve the HJB equation when an explicit solution is not available. Based on these results, we propose an approximate Bayes-optimal policy for solving Bayesian bandit problems with large horizons. Our method has the added benefit that its computational cost does not increase as the horizon increases.

**Abstract:** In action recognition, although the combination of spatio-temporal videos and skeleton features can improve the recognition performance, a separate model and balancing feature representation for cross-modal data are required. To solve these problems, we propose Spatio-TemporAl cRoss (STAR)-transformer, which can effectively represent two cross-modal features as a recognizable vector. First, from the input video and skeleton sequence, video frames are output as global grid tokens and skeletons are output as joint map tokens, respectively. These tokens are then aggregated into multi-class tokens and input into STAR-transformer. The STAR-transformer encoder layer consists of a full self-attention (FAttn) module and a proposed zigzag spatio-temporal attention (ZAttn) module. Similarly, the continuous decoder consists of a FAttn module and a proposed binary spatio-temporal attention (BAttn) module. STAR-transformer learns an efficient multi-feature representation of the spatio-temporal features by properly arranging pairings of the FAttn, ZAttn, and BAttn modules. Experimental results on the Penn-Action, NTU RGB+D 60, and 120 datasets show that the proposed method achieves a promising improvement in performance in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract:** Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is significant for the safe deployment of NLP models. Among recent textual OOD detection works based on pretrained language models (PLMs), distance-based methods have shown superior performance. However, they estimate sample distance scores in the last-layer CLS embedding space and thus do not make full use of linguistic information underlying in PLMs. To address the issue, we propose to boost OOD detection by deriving more holistic sentence embeddings. On the basis of the observations that token averaging and layer combination contribute to improving OOD detection, we propose a simple embedding approach named Avg-Avg, which averages all token representations from each intermediate layer as the sentence embedding and significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks by a 9.33% FAR95 margin. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that it indeed helps preserve general linguistic knowledge in fine-tuned PLMs and substantially benefits detecting background shifts. The simple yet effective embedding method can be applied to fine-tuned PLMs with negligible extra costs, providing a free gain in OOD detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/Avg-Avg.

**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims at learning an effective policy from offline datasets without active interactions with the environment. The major challenge of offline RL is the distribution shift that appears when out-of-distribution actions are queried, which makes the policy improvement direction biased by extrapolation errors. Most existing methods address this problem by penalizing the policy for deviating from the behavior policy during policy improvement or making conservative updates for value functions during policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel MISA framework to approach offline RL from the perspective of Mutual Information between States and Actions in the dataset by directly constraining the policy improvement direction. Intuitively, mutual information measures the mutual dependence of actions and states, which reflects how a behavior agent reacts to certain environment states during data collection. To effectively utilize this information to facilitate policy learning, MISA constructs lower bounds of mutual information parameterized by the policy and Q-values. We show that optimizing this lower bound is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of a one-step improved policy on the offline dataset. In this way, we constrain the policy improvement direction to lie in the data manifold. The resulting algorithm simultaneously augments the policy evaluation and improvement by adding a mutual information regularization. MISA is a general offline RL framework that unifies conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior regularization methods (e.g., TD3+BC) as special cases. Our experiments show that MISA performs significantly better than existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art on various tasks of the D4RL benchmark.

**Abstract:** Existing work on controlled text generation (CTG) assumes a control interface of categorical attributes. In this work, we propose a natural language (NL) interface, where we craft a PCFG to embed the control attributes into natural language commands, and propose variants of existing CTG models that take commands as input. In our experiments, we design tailored setups to test model's generalization abilities. We find our PCFG-based command generation approach is effective for handling unseen commands compared to fix-set templates; our proposed NL models can effectively generalize to unseen attributes, a new ability enabled by the NL interface, as well as unseen attribute combinations. Interestingly, we discover that the simple conditional generation approach, enhanced with our proposed NL interface, is a strong baseline in those challenging settings.

**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed the effectiveness of contrastive learning in obtaining the representation of dataset that is useful in interpretation and downstream tasks. However, the mechanism that describes this effectiveness have not been thoroughly analyzed, and many studies have been conducted to investigate the data structures captured by contrastive learning. In particular, the recent study of \citet{content_isolate} has shown that contrastive learning is capable of decomposing the data space into the space that is invariant to all augmentations and its complement. In this paper, we introduce the notion of invariance-adapted latent space that decomposes the data space into the intersections of the invariant spaces of each augmentation and their complements. This decomposition generalizes the one introduced in \citet{content_isolate}, and describes a structure that is analogous to the frequencies in the harmonic analysis of a group. We experimentally show that contrastive learning with lasso-type metric can be used to find an invariance-adapted latent space, thereby suggesting a new potential for the contrastive learning. We also investigate when such a latent space can be identified up to mixings within each component.

**Abstract:** In this paper we present a three-stream algorithm for real-time action recognition and a new dataset of handwash videos, with the intent of aligning action recognition with real-world constraints to yield effective conclusions. A three-stream fusion algorithm is proposed, which runs both accurately and efficiently, in real-time even on low-powered systems such as a Raspberry Pi. The cornerstone of the proposed algorithm is the incorporation of both spatial and temporal information, as well as the information of the objects in a video while using an efficient architecture, and Optical Flow computation to achieve commendable results in real-time. The results achieved by this algorithm are benchmarked on the UCF-101 as well as the HMDB-51 datasets, achieving an accuracy of 92.7% and 64.9% respectively. An important point to note is that the algorithm is novel in the aspect that it is also able to learn the intricate differences between extremely similar actions, which would be difficult even for the human eye. Additionally, noticing a dearth in the number of datasets for the recognition of very similar or fine-grained actions, this paper also introduces a new dataset that is made publicly available, the Hand Wash Dataset with the intent of introducing a new benchmark for fine-grained action recognition tasks in the future.

**Abstract:** We address dense action forecasting: the problem of predicting future action sequence over long durations based on partial observation. Our key insight is that future action sequences are more accurately modeled with variable, rather than one, levels of abstraction, and that the optimal level of abstraction can be dynamically selected during the prediction process. Our experiments show that most parts of future action sequences can be predicted confidently in fine detail only in small segments of future frames, which are effectively ``islands'' of high model prediction confidence in a ``sea'' of uncertainty. We propose a combination Bayesian neural network and hierarchical convolutional segmentation model to both accurately predict future actions and optimally select abstraction levels. We evaluate this approach on standard datasets against existing state-of-the-art systems and demonstrate that our ``islands of predictability'' approach maintains fine-grained action predictions while also making accurate abstract predictions where systems were previously unable to do so, and thus results in substantial, monotonic increases in accuracy.

**Abstract:** As an emerging machine learning paradigm, self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to learn high-quality representations for complex data without data labels. Prior work shows that, besides obviating the reliance on labeling, SSL also benefits adversarial robustness by making it more challenging for the adversary to manipulate model prediction. However, whether this robustness benefit generalizes to other types of attacks remains an open question.
  We explore this question in the context of trojan attacks by showing that SSL is comparably vulnerable as supervised learning to trojan attacks. Specifically, we design and evaluate CTRL, an extremely simple self-supervised trojan attack. By polluting a tiny fraction of training data (less than 1%) with indistinguishable poisoning samples, CTRL causes any trigger-embedded input to be misclassified to the adversary's desired class with a high probability (over 99%) at inference. More importantly, through the lens of CTRL, we study the mechanisms underlying self-supervised trojan attacks. With both empirical and analytical evidence, we reveal that the representation invariance property of SSL, which benefits adversarial robustness, may also be the very reason making SSL highly vulnerable to trojan attacks. We further discuss the fundamental challenges to defending against self-supervised trojan attacks, pointing to promising directions for future research.

**Abstract:** Despite cross-lingual generalization demonstrated by pre-trained multilingual models, the translate-train paradigm of transferring English datasets across multiple languages remains to be the key ingredient for training task-specific multilingual models. However, for many low-resource languages, the availability of a reliable translation service entails significant amounts of costly human-annotated translation pairs. Further, the translation services for low-resource languages may continue to be brittle due to domain mismatch between the task-specific input text and the general-purpose text used while training the translation models. We consider the task of multilingual semantic parsing and demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility offered by large language models (LLMs) for translating English datasets into several languages via few-shot prompting. We provide (i) Extensive comparisons with prior translate-train methods across 50 languages demonstrating that LLMs can serve as highly effective data translators, outperforming prior translation based methods on 40 out of 50 languages; (ii) A comprehensive study of the key design choices that enable effective data translation via prompted LLMs.

**Abstract:** Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a layer-2 blockchain scalability solution, with its main entity, the payment channel, enabling transactions between pairs of nodes "off-chain," thus reducing the burden on the layer-1 network. Nodes with multiple channels can serve as relays for multihop payments over a path of channels: they relay payments of others by providing the liquidity of their channels, in exchange for part of the amount withheld as a fee. Relay nodes might after a while end up with one or more unbalanced channels, and thus need to trigger a rebalancing operation. In this paper, we study how a relay node can maximize its profits from fees by using the rebalancing method of submarine swaps. We introduce a stochastic model to capture the dynamics of a relay node observing random transaction arrivals and performing occasional rebalancing operations, and express the system evolution as a Markov Decision Process. We formulate the problem of the maximization of the node's fortune over time over all rebalancing policies, and approximate the optimal solution by designing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based rebalancing policy. We build a discrete event simulator of the system and use it to demonstrate the DRL policy's superior performance under most conditions by conducting a comparative study of different policies and parameterizations. In all, our approach aims to be the first to introduce DRL for network optimization in the complex world of PCNs.

**Abstract:** Traditional systems designed for task oriented dialog utilize knowledge present only in structured knowledge sources to generate responses. However, relevant information required to generate responses may also reside in unstructured sources, such as documents. Recent state of the art models such as HyKnow and SeKnow aimed at overcoming these challenges make limiting assumptions about the knowledge sources. For instance, these systems assume that certain types of information, such as a phone number, is always present in a structured KB while information about aspects such as entrance ticket prices would always be available in documents.
  In this paper, we create a modified version of the MutliWOZ based dataset prepared by SeKnow to demonstrate how current methods have significant degradation in performance when strict assumptions about the source of information are removed. Then, in line with recent work exploiting pre-trained language models, we fine-tune a BART based model using prompts for the tasks of querying knowledge sources, as well as, for response generation, without making assumptions about the information present in each knowledge source. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our model is robust to perturbations to knowledge modality (source of information), and that it can fuse information from structured as well as unstructured knowledge to generate responses.

**Abstract:** Pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) is the most common type of brain cancer among children, and the identification of molecular markers for pLGG is crucial for successful treatment planning. Current standard care is biopsy, which is invasive. Thus, the non-invasive imaging-based approaches, where Machine Learning (ML) has a high potential, are impactful. Recently, we developed a tumor-location-based algorithm and demonstrated its potential to differentiate pLGG molecular subtypes. In this work, we first reevaluated the performance of the location-based algorithm on a larger pLGG dataset, which includes 214 patients and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 77.90. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm increased the average AUROC to 86.11. Ultimately, we designed and implemented a tumor-location-guided CNN algorithm and achieved average AUROC of 88.64. Using a repeated experiment approach with 100 runs, we ensured the results were reproducible and the improvement was statistically significant.

**Abstract:** Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques are widely used for various natural science applications. Increasingly, machine learning (ML) force field (FF) models begin to replace ab-initio simulations by predicting forces directly from atomic structures. Despite significant progress in this area, such techniques are primarily benchmarked by their force/energy prediction errors, even though the practical use case would be to produce realistic MD trajectories. We aim to fill this gap by introducing a novel benchmark suite for ML MD simulation. We curate representative MD systems, including water, organic molecules, peptide, and materials, and design evaluation metrics corresponding to the scientific objectives of respective systems. We benchmark a collection of state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML FF models and illustrate, in particular, how the commonly benchmarked force accuracy is not well aligned with relevant simulation metrics. We demonstrate when and how selected SOTA methods fail, along with offering directions for further improvement. Specifically, we identify stability as a key metric for ML models to improve. Our benchmark suite comes with a comprehensive open-source codebase for training and simulation with ML FFs to facilitate further work.

**Abstract:** A deep neural network using rectified linear units represents a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function and vice versa. Recent results in the literature estimated that the number of neurons needed to exactly represent any CPWL function grows exponentially with the number of pieces or exponentially in terms of the factorial of the number of distinct linear components. Moreover, such growth is amplified linearly with the input dimension. These existing results seem to indicate that the cost of representing a CPWL function is expensive. In this paper, we propose much tighter bounds and establish a polynomial time algorithm to find a network satisfying these bounds for any given CPWL function. We prove that the number of hidden neurons required to exactly represent any CPWL function is at most a quadratic function of the number of pieces. In contrast to all previous results, this upper bound is invariant to the input dimension. Besides the number of pieces, we also study the number of distinct linear components in CPWL functions. When such a number is also given, we prove that the quadratic complexity turns into bilinear, which implies a lower neural complexity because the number of distinct linear components is always not greater than the minimum number of pieces in a CPWL function. When the number of pieces is unknown, we prove that, in terms of the number of distinct linear components, the neural complexity of any CPWL function is at most polynomial growth for low-dimensional inputs and a factorial growth for the worst-case scenario, which are significantly better than existing results in the literature.

**Abstract:** We study the convergence rate of discretized Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on sampling from distributions in the form of $e^{-f(x)}$ on a convex set $\mathcal{M}\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We show that for distributions in the form of $e^{-Œ±^{\top}x}$ on a polytope with $m$ constraints, the convergence rate of a family of commonly-used integrators is independent of $\left\Vert Œ±\right\Vert_2$ and the geometry of the polytope. In particular, the Implicit Midpoint Method (IMM) and the generalized Leapfrog integrator (LM) have a mixing time of $\widetilde{O}\left(mn^{3}\right)$ to achieve $Œµ$ total variation distance to the target distribution. These guarantees are based on a general bound on the convergence rate for densities of the form $e^{-f(x)}$ in terms of parameters of the manifold and the integrator. Our theoretical guarantee complements the empirical results of [KLSV22], which shows that RHMC with IMM can sample ill-conditioned, non-smooth and constrained distributions in very high dimension efficiently in practice.

**Abstract:** Sign language gloss translation aims to translate the sign glosses into spoken language texts, which is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled gloss-text parallel data. Back translation (BT), which generates pseudo-parallel data by translating in-domain spoken language texts into sign glosses, has been applied to alleviate the data scarcity problem. However, the lack of large-scale high-quality domain spoken language text data limits the effect of BT. In this paper, to overcome the limitation, we propose a Prompt based domain text Generation (PGEN) approach to produce the large-scale in-domain spoken language text data. Specifically, PGEN randomly concatenates sentences from the original in-domain spoken language text data as prompts to induce a pre-trained language model (i.e., GPT-2) to generate spoken language texts in a similar style. Experimental results on three benchmarks of sign language gloss translation in varied languages demonstrate that BT with spoken language texts generated by PGEN significantly outperforms the compared methods. In addition, as the scale of spoken language texts generated by PGEN increases, the BT technique can achieve further improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We release the code and data for facilitating future research in this field.

**Abstract:** The ever-growing size of the foundation language model has brought significant performance gains in various types of downstream tasks. With the existence of side-effects brought about by the large size of the foundation language model such as deployment cost, availability issues, and environmental cost, there is some interest in exploring other possible directions, such as a divide-and-conquer scheme. In this paper, we are asking a basic question: are language processes naturally dividable? We study this problem with a simple two-tower language model setting, where two language models with identical configurations are trained side-by-side cooperatively. With this setting, we discover the spontaneous emerging preference phenomenon, where some of the tokens are consistently better predicted by one tower while others by another tower. This phenomenon is qualitatively stable, regardless of model configuration and type, suggesting this as an intrinsic property of natural language. This study suggests that interesting properties of natural language are still waiting to be discovered, which may aid the future development of natural language processing techniques.

**Abstract:** Treewidth and hypertree width have proven to be highly successful structural parameters in the context of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). When either of these parameters is bounded by a constant, then CSP becomes solvable in polynomial time. However, here the order of the polynomial in the running time depends on the width, and this is known to be unavoidable; therefore, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by either of these width measures. Here we introduce an enhancement of tree and hypertree width through a novel notion of thresholds, allowing the associated decompositions to take into account information about the computational costs associated with solving the given CSP instance. Aside from introducing these notions, we obtain efficient theoretical as well as empirical algorithms for computing threshold treewidth and hypertree width and show that these parameters give rise to fixed-parameter algorithms for CSP as well as other, more general problems. We complement our theoretical results with experimental evaluations in terms of heuristics as well as exact methods based on SAT/SMT encodings.

**Abstract:** We propose a practical integration of logical state abstraction with AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for reinforcement learning agents, to significantly expand the model class that AIXI agents can be approximated over to complex history-dependent and structured environments. The state representation and reasoning framework is based on higher-order logic, which can be used to define and enumerate complex features on non-Markovian and structured environments. We address the problem of selecting the right subset of features to form state abstractions by adapting the $Œ¶$-MDP optimisation criterion from state abstraction theory. Exact Bayesian model learning is then achieved using a suitable generalisation of Context Tree Weighting over abstract state sequences. The resultant architecture can be integrated with different planning algorithms. Experimental results on controlling epidemics on large-scale contact networks validates the agent's performance.

**Abstract:** Reliable contact simulation plays a key role in the development of (semi-)autonomous robots, especially when dealing with contact-rich manipulation scenarios, an active robotics research topic. Besides simulation, components such as sensing, perception, data collection, robot hardware control, human interfaces, etc. are all key enablers towards applying machine learning algorithms or model-based approaches in real world systems. However, there is a lack of software connecting reliable contact simulation with the larger robotics ecosystem (i.e. ROS, Orocos), for a more seamless application of novel approaches, found in the literature, to existing robotic hardware. In this paper, we present the ROS-PyBullet Interface, a framework that provides a bridge between the reliable contact/impact simulator PyBullet and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Furthermore, we provide additional utilities for facilitating Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the simulated environment. We also present several use-cases that highlight the capabilities and usefulness of our framework. Please check our video, source code, and examples included in the supplementary material.

**Abstract:** Video language pre-training methods have mainly adopted sparse sampling techniques to alleviate the temporal redundancy of videos. Though effective, sparse sampling still suffers inter-modal redundancy: visual redundancy and textual redundancy. Compared with highly generalized text, sparsely sampled frames usually contain text-independent portions, called visual redundancy. Sparse sampling is also likely to miss important frames corresponding to some text portions, resulting in textual redundancy. Inter-modal redundancy leads to a mismatch of video and text information, hindering the model from better learning the shared semantics across modalities. To alleviate it, we propose Redundancy-aware Video-language Pre-training. We design a redundancy measurement of video patches and text tokens by calculating the cross-modal minimum dis-similarity. Then, we penalize the highredundant video patches and text tokens through a proposed redundancy-aware contrastive learning. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets, MSRVTT, MSVD, DiDeMo, and LSMDC, achieving a significant improvement over the previous stateof-the-art results. Our code are available at https://github.com/caskcsg/VLP/tree/main/RaP.

**Abstract:** In recent years, we have seen a handful of work on inference algorithms over non-stationary data streams. Given their flexibility, Bayesian non-parametric models are a good candidate for these scenarios. However, reliable streaming inference under the concept drift phenomenon is still an open problem for these models. In this work, we propose a variational inference algorithm for Dirichlet process mixture models. Our proposal deals with the concept drift by including an exponential forgetting over the prior global parameters. Our algorithm allows to adapt the learned model to the concept drifts automatically. We perform experiments in both synthetic and real data, showing that the proposed model is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the density estimation problem, and it outperforms them in the clustering problem.

**Abstract:** Bayesian optimization (BO), which uses a Gaussian process (GP) as a surrogate to model its objective function, is popular for black-box optimization. However, due to the limitations of GPs, BO underperforms in some problems such as those with categorical, high-dimensional or image inputs. To this end, recent works have used the highly expressive neural networks (NNs) as the surrogate model and derived theoretical guarantees using the theory of neural tangent kernel (NTK). However, these works suffer from the limitations of the requirement to invert an extremely large parameter matrix and the restriction to the sequential (rather than batch) setting. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two algorithms based on the Thompson sampling (TS) policy named Sample-Then-Optimize Batch Neural TS (STO-BNTS) and STO-BNTS-Linear. To choose an input query, we only need to train an NN (resp. a linear model) and then choose the query by maximizing the trained NN (resp. linear model), which is equivalently sampled from the GP posterior with the NTK as the kernel function. As a result, our algorithms sidestep the need to invert the large parameter matrix yet still preserve the validity of the TS policy. Next, we derive regret upper bounds for our algorithms with batch evaluations, and use insights from batch BO and NTK to show that they are asymptotically no-regret under certain conditions. Finally, we verify their empirical effectiveness using practical AutoML and reinforcement learning experiments.

**Abstract:** Automated algorithm configuration relieves users from tedious, trial-and-error tuning tasks. A popular algorithm configuration tuning paradigm is dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC), in which an agent learns dynamic configuration policies across instances by reinforcement learning (RL). However, in many complex algorithms, there may exist different types of configuration hyperparameters, and such heterogeneity may bring difficulties for classic DAC which uses a single-agent RL policy. In this paper, we aim to address this issue and propose multi-agent DAC (MA-DAC), with one agent working for one type of configuration hyperparameter. MA-DAC formulates the dynamic configuration of a complex algorithm with multiple types of hyperparameters as a contextual multi-agent Markov decision process and solves it by a cooperative multi-agent RL (MARL) algorithm. To instantiate, we apply MA-DAC to a well-known optimization algorithm for multi-objective optimization problems. Experimental results show the effectiveness of MA-DAC in not only achieving superior performance compared with other configuration tuning approaches based on heuristic rules, multi-armed bandits, and single-agent RL, but also being capable of generalizing to different problem classes. Furthermore, we release the environments in this paper as a benchmark for testing MARL algorithms, with the hope of facilitating the application of MARL.

**Abstract:** Sparse decision trees are one of the most common forms of interpretable models. While recent advances have produced algorithms that fully optimize sparse decision trees for prediction, that work does not address policy design, because the algorithms cannot handle weighted data samples. Specifically, they rely on the discreteness of the loss function, which means that real-valued weights cannot be directly used. For example, none of the existing techniques produce policies that incorporate inverse propensity weighting on individual data points. We present three algorithms for efficient sparse weighted decision tree optimization. The first approach directly optimizes the weighted loss function; however, it tends to be computationally inefficient for large datasets. Our second approach, which scales more efficiently, transforms weights to integer values and uses data duplication to transform the weighted decision tree optimization problem into an unweighted (but larger) counterpart. Our third algorithm, which scales to much larger datasets, uses a randomized procedure that samples each data point with a probability proportional to its weight. We present theoretical bounds on the error of the two fast methods and show experimentally that these methods can be two orders of magnitude faster than the direct optimization of the weighted loss, without losing significant accuracy.

**Abstract:** The stochastic heavy ball method (SHB), also known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Polyak's momentum, is widely used in training neural networks. However, despite the remarkable success of such algorithm in practice, its theoretical characterization remains limited. In this paper, we focus on neural networks with two and three layers and provide a rigorous understanding of the properties of the solutions found by SHB: \emph{(i)} stability after dropping out part of the neurons, \emph{(ii)} connectivity along a low-loss path, and \emph{(iii)} convergence to the global optimum. To achieve this goal, we take a mean-field view and relate the SHB dynamics to a certain partial differential equation in the limit of large network widths. This mean-field perspective has inspired a recent line of work focusing on SGD while, in contrast, our paper considers an algorithm with momentum. More specifically, after proving existence and uniqueness of the limit differential equations, we show convergence to the global optimum and give a quantitative bound between the mean-field limit and the SHB dynamics of a finite-width network. Armed with this last bound, we are able to establish the dropout-stability and connectivity of SHB solutions.

**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved comparable or superior performance than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. This empirical breakthrough is even more remarkable since, in contrast to CNNs, ViTs do not embed any visual inductive bias of spatial locality. Yet, recent works have shown that while minimizing their training loss, ViTs specifically learn spatially localized patterns. This raises a central question: how do ViTs learn these patterns by solely minimizing their training loss using gradient-based methods from random initialization? In this paper, we provide some theoretical justification of this phenomenon. We propose a spatially structured dataset and a simplified ViT model. In this model, the attention matrix solely depends on the positional encodings. We call this mechanism the positional attention mechanism. On the theoretical side, we consider a binary classification task and show that while the learning problem admits multiple solutions that generalize, our model implicitly learns the spatial structure of the dataset while generalizing: we call this phenomenon patch association. We prove that patch association helps to sample-efficiently transfer to downstream datasets that share the same structure as the pre-training one but differ in the features. Lastly, we empirically verify that a ViT with positional attention performs similarly to the original one on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ImageNet.

**Abstract:** Accurate passenger flow prediction of urban rail transit is essential for improving the performance of intelligent transportation systems, especially during the epidemic. How to dynamically model the complex spatiotemporal dependencies of passenger flow is the main issue in achieving accurate passenger flow prediction during the epidemic. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a brand-new transformer-based architecture called STformer under the encoder-decoder framework specifically for COVID-19. Concretely, we develop a modified self-attention mechanism named Causal-Convolution ProbSparse Self-Attention (CPSA) to model the multiple temporal dependencies of passenger flow with low computational costs. To capture the complex and dynamic spatial dependencies, we introduce a novel Adaptive Multi-Graph Convolution Network (AMGCN) by leveraging multiple graphs in a self-adaptive manner. Additionally, the Multi-source Data Fusion block fuses the passenger flow data, COVID-19 confirmed case data, and the relevant social media data to study the impact of COVID-19 to passenger flow. Experiments on real-world passenger flow datasets demonstrate the superiority of ST-former over the other eleven state-of-the-art methods. Several ablation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness and reliability of our model structure. Results can provide critical insights for the operation of URT systems.

**Abstract:** Deep learning based on deep neural networks has been very successful in many practical applications, but it lacks enough theoretical understanding due to the network architectures and structures. In this paper, we establish the analysis for linear feature extraction by deep multi-channel convolutional neural networks(CNNs), which demonstrates the power of deep learning over traditional linear transformations, like Fourier, Wavelets, and Redundant dictionary coding methods. Moreover, we give an exact construction presenting how linear features extraction can be conducted efficiently with multi-channel CNNs. It can be applied to lower the essential dimension for approximating a high-dimensional function. Rates of function approximation by such deep networks implemented with channels and followed by fully-connected layers are investigated as well. Harmonic analysis for factorizing linear features into multi-resolution convolutions plays an essential role in our work. Nevertheless, a dedicate vectorization of matrices is constructed, which bridges 1D CNN and 2D CNN and allows us have corresponding 2D analysis.

**Abstract:** Large-scale graph training is a notoriously challenging problem for graph neural networks (GNNs). Due to the nature of evolving graph structures into the training process, vanilla GNNs usually fail to scale up, limited by the GPU memory space. Up to now, though numerous scalable GNN architectures have been proposed, we still lack a comprehensive survey and fair benchmark of this reservoir to find the rationale for designing scalable GNNs. To this end, we first systematically formulate the representative methods of large-scale graph training into several branches and further establish a fair and consistent benchmark for them by a greedy hyperparameter searching. In addition, regarding efficiency, we theoretically evaluate the time and space complexity of various branches and empirically compare them w.r.t GPU memory usage, throughput, and convergence. Furthermore, We analyze the pros and cons for various branches of scalable GNNs and then present a new ensembling training manner, named EnGCN, to address the existing issues. Remarkably, our proposed method has achieved new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on large-scale datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Large_Scale_GCN_Benchmarking.

**Abstract:** Tumor lesion segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical image analysis. In clinical practice, Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography~(FDG-PET) is a widely used technique to identify and quantify metabolically active tumors. However, since FDG-PET scans only provide metabolic information, healthy tissue or benign disease with irregular glucose consumption may be mistaken for cancer. To handle this challenge, PET is commonly combined with Computed Tomography~(CT), with the CT used to obtain the anatomic structure of the patient. The combination of PET-based metabolic and CT-based anatomic information can contribute to better tumor segmentation results. %Computed tomography~(CT) is a popular modality to illustrate the anatomic structure of the patient. The combination of PET and CT is promising to handle this challenge by utilizing metabolic and anatomic information. In this paper, we explore the potential of U-Net for lesion segmentation in whole-body FDG-PET/CT scans from three aspects, including network architecture, data preprocessing, and data augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the vanilla U-Net with proper input shape can achieve satisfactory performance. Specifically, our method achieves first place in both preliminary and final leaderboards of the autoPET 2022 challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yejin0111/autoPET2022_Blackbean.

**Abstract:** Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property commonly used in various quantum information protocols and algorithms. Nonetheless, the problem of quantifying entanglement has still not reached general solution for systems larger than two qubits. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of detecting entanglement with the use of the supervised machine learning method, namely the deep convolutional neural networks. We build a model consisting of convolutional layers, which is able to recognize and predict the presence of entanglement for any bipartition of the given multi-qubit system. We demonstrate that training our model on synthetically generated datasets collecting random density matrices, which either include or exclude challenging positive-under-partial-transposition entangled states (PPTES), leads to the different accuracy of the model and its possibility to detect such states. Moreover, it is shown that enforcing entanglement-preserving symmetry operations (local operations on qubit or permutations of qubits) by using triple Siamese network, can significantly increase the model performance and ability to generalize on types of states not seen during the training stage. We perform numerical calculations for 3,4 and 5-qubit systems, therefore proving the scalability of the proposed approach.

**Abstract:** One of the biggest hurdles robotics faces is the facet of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Reinforcement learning offers a set of tools, and a framework to address this problem. In parallel, the misgivings of robotics offer a solid testing ground and evaluation metric for advancements in reinforcement learning. The two disciplines go hand-in-hand, much like the fields of Mathematics and Physics. By means of this survey paper, we aim to invigorate links between the research communities of the two disciplines by focusing on the work done in reinforcement learning for locomotive and control aspects of robotics. Additionally, we aim to highlight not only the notable successes but also the key challenges of the application of Reinforcement Learning in Robotics. This paper aims to serve as a reference guide for researchers in reinforcement learning applied to the field of robotics. The literature survey is at a fairly introductory level, aimed at aspiring researchers. Appropriately, we have covered the most essential concepts required for research in the field of reinforcement learning, with robotics in mind. Through a thorough analysis of this problem, we are able to manifest how reinforcement learning could be applied profitably, and also focus on open-ended questions, as well as the potential for future research.

**Abstract:** Privacy concerns in federated learning (FL) are commonly addressed with secure aggregation schemes that prevent a central party from observing plaintext client updates. However, most such schemes neglect orthogonal FL research that aims at reducing communication between clients and the aggregator and is instrumental in facilitating cross-device FL with thousands and even millions of (mobile) participants. In particular, quantization techniques can typically reduce client-server communication by a factor of 32x.
  In this paper, we unite both research directions by introducing an efficient secure aggregation framework based on outsourced multi-party computation (MPC) that supports any linear quantization scheme. Specifically, we design a novel approximate version of an MPC-based secure aggregation protocol with support for multiple stochastic quantization schemes, including ones that utilize the randomized Hadamard transform and Kashin's representation. In our empirical performance evaluation, we show that with no additional overhead for clients and moderate inter-server communication, we achieve similar training accuracy as insecure schemes for standard FL benchmarks.
  Beyond this, we present an efficient extension to our secure quantized aggregation framework that effectively defends against state-of-the-art untargeted poisoning attacks.

**Abstract:** Contrastive learning, a self-supervised learning method that can learn representations from unlabeled data, has been developed promisingly. Many methods of contrastive learning depend on data augmentation techniques, which generate different views from the original signal. However, tuning policies and hyper-parameters for more effective data augmentation methods in contrastive learning is often time and resource-consuming. Researchers have designed approaches to automatically generate new views for some input signals, especially on the image data. But the view-learning method is not well developed for time-series data. In this work, we propose a simple but effective module for automating view generation for time-series data in contrastive learning, named learning views for time-series data (LEAVES). The proposed module learns the hyper-parameters for augmentations using adversarial training in contrastive learning. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using multiple time-series datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective in finding reasonable views and performs downstream tasks better than the baselines, including manually tuned augmentation-based contrastive learning methods and SOTA methods.

**Abstract:** Task competition by robots is still off from being completely dependable and usable. One way a robot may decipher information given to it and accomplish tasks is by utilizing FOON, which stands for functional object-oriented network. The network first needs to be created by having a human creates action nodes as well as input and output nodes in a .txt file. After the network is sizeable, utilization of this network allows for traversal of the network in a variety of ways such as choosing steps via iterative deepening searching by using the first seen valid option. Another mechanism is heuristics, such as choosing steps based on the highest success rate or lowest amount of input ingredients. Via any of these methods, a program can traverse the network given an output product, and derive the series of steps that need to be taken to produce the output.

**Abstract:** Model generalization of the underlying dynamics is critical for achieving data efficiency when learning for robot control. This paper proposes a novel approach for learning dynamics leveraging the symmetry in the underlying robotic system, which allows for robust extrapolation from fewer samples. Existing frameworks that represent all data in vector space fail to consider the structured information of the robot, such as leg symmetry, rotational symmetry, and physics invariance. As a result, these schemes require vast amounts of training data to learn the system's redundant elements because they are learned independently. Instead, we propose considering the geometric prior by representing the system in symmetrical object groups and designing neural network architecture to assess invariance and equivariance between the objects. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the generalization to unseen data of the proposed model and the existing models. We also implement a controller of a climbing robot based on learned inverse dynamics models. The results show that our method generates accurate control inputs that help the robot reach the desired state while requiring less training data than existing methods.

**Abstract:** This paper proposes an advantage estimation approach based on data augmentation for policy optimization. Unlike using data augmentation on the input to learn value and policy function as existing methods use, our method uses data augmentation to compute a bootstrap advantage estimation. This Bootstrap Advantage Estimation (BAE) is then used for learning and updating the gradient of policy and value function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted experiments on several environments. These environments are from three benchmarks: Procgen, Deepmind Control, and Pybullet, which include both image and vector-based observations; discrete and continuous action spaces. We observe that our method reduces the policy and the value loss better than the Generalized advantage estimation (GAE) method and eventually improves cumulative return. Furthermore, our method performs better than two recently proposed data augmentation techniques (RAD and DRAC). Overall, our method performs better empirically than baselines in sample efficiency and generalization, where the agent is tested in unseen environments.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we aim at reducing the variance of doubly stochastic optimization, a type of stochastic optimization algorithm that contains two independent sources of randomness: The subsampling of training data and the Monte Carlo estimation of expectations. Such an optimization regime often has the issue of large gradient variance which would lead to a slow rate of convergence. Therefore we propose Dual Control Variate, a new type of control variate capable of reducing gradient variance from both sources jointly. The dual control variate is built upon approximation-based control variates and incremental gradient methods. We show that on doubly stochastic optimization problems, compared with past variance reduction approaches that take only one source of randomness into account, dual control variate leads to a gradient estimator of significant smaller variance and demonstrates superior performance on real-world applications, like generalized linear models with dropout and black-box variational inference.

**Abstract:** The advent of deep learning (DL) gave rise to significant breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning (RL) research. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have reached super-human level skills when applied to vision-based control problems as such in Atari 2600 games where environment states were extracted from pixel information. Unfortunately, these environments are far from being applicable to highly dynamic and complex real-world tasks as in autonomous control of a fighter aircraft since these environments only involve 2D representation of a visual world. Here, we present a semi-realistic flight simulation environment Harfang3D Dog-Fight Sandbox for fighter aircrafts. It is aimed to be a flexible toolbox for the investigation of main challenges in aviation studies using Reinforcement Learning. The program provides easy access to flight dynamics model, environment states, and aerodynamics of the plane enabling user to customize any specific task in order to build intelligent decision making (control) systems via RL. The software also allows deployment of bot aircrafts and development of multi-agent tasks. This way, multiple groups of aircrafts can be configured to be competitive or cooperative agents to perform complicated tasks including Dog Fight. During the experiments, we carried out training for two different scenarios: navigating to a designated location and within visual range (WVR) combat, shortly Dog Fight. Using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques for both scenarios, we were able to train competent agents that exhibit human-like behaviours. Based on this results, it is confirmed that Harfang3D Dog-Fight Sandbox can be utilized as a 3D realistic RL research platform.

**Abstract:** Multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a set of robots in a continuous state space. The difficulty of MRMP increases with the number of robots due to the increased potential for collisions between robots. This problem is exacerbated in environments with narrow passages that robots must pass through, like warehouses. In single-robot settings, topology-guided motion planning methods have shown increased performance in these constricted environments. We adapt an existing topology-guided single-robot motion planning method to the multi-robot domain, introducing topological guidance for the composite space. We demonstrate our method's ability to efficiently plan paths in complex environments with many narrow passages, scaling to robot teams of size up to five times larger than existing methods in this class of problems. By leveraging knowledge of the topology of the environment, we also find higher quality solutions than other methods.

**Abstract:** In this thesis, we present recent advances at the precision frontier of higher-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. We consider massless two-loop five-point amplitudes, with a particular focus on diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion. We build a library of infrared functions up to at most next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, which can be used to validate amplitudes and construct counterterms in subtraction schemes at NNLO. We review progress in the novel use of machine learning technology to optimise the evaluation of amplitudes in hadron collider simulations. We present the full-colour virtual QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion, discussing the new techniques developed to calculate these non-planar two-loop amplitudes. We use these amplitudes to compute the next-to-leading QCD corrections to the differential cross sections of diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the Large Hadron Collider. We also present the leading-colour double-virtual corrections to hadronic trijet production. All derived amplitudes are made available in a public implementation that is ready for further phenomenological application.

**Abstract:** Domain-specific neural machine translation (NMT) systems (e.g., in educational applications) are socially significant with the potential to help make information accessible to a diverse set of users in multilingual societies. It is desirable that such NMT systems be lexically constrained and draw from domain-specific dictionaries. Dictionaries could present multiple candidate translations for a source words/phrases on account of the polysemous nature of words. The onus is then on the NMT model to choose the contextually most appropriate candidate. Prior work has largely ignored this problem and focused on the single candidate setting where the target word or phrase is replaced by a single constraint. In this work we present DICTDIS, a lexically constrained NMT system that disambiguates between multiple candidate translations derived from dictionaries. We achieve this by augmenting training data with multiple dictionary candidates to actively encourage disambiguation during training. We demonstrate the utility of DICTDIS via extensive experiments on English-Hindi sentences in a variety of domains including news, finance, medicine and engineering. We obtain superior disambiguation performance on all domains with improved fluency in some domains of up to 4 BLEU points, when compared with existing approaches for lexically constrained and unconstrained NMT.

**Abstract:** Quantum kernel methods are a candidate for quantum speed-ups in supervised machine learning. The number of quantum measurements $N$ required for a reasonable kernel estimate is a critical resource, both from complexity considerations and because of the constraints of near-term quantum hardware. We emphasize that for classification tasks, the aim is accurate classification and not accurate kernel evaluation, and demonstrate that the former is more resource efficient. In general, the uncertainty in the quantum kernel, arising from finite sampling, leads to misclassifications over some kernel instantiations. We introduce a suitable performance metric that characterizes the robustness or reliability of classification over a dataset, and obtain a bound for $N$ which ensures, with high probability, that classification errors over a dataset are bounded by the margin errors of an idealized quantum kernel classifier. Using techniques of robust optimization, we then show that the number of quantum measurements can be significantly reduced by a robust formulation of the original support vector machine. We consider the SWAP test and the GATES test quantum circuits for kernel evaluations, and show that the SWAP test is always less reliable than the GATES test for any $N$. Our strategy is applicable to uncertainty in quantum kernels arising from {\em any} source of noise, although we only consider the statistical sampling noise in our analysis.

**Abstract:** This work proposes a framework that incorporates trust in an ad hoc teamwork scenario with human-agent teams, where an agent must collaborate with a human to perform a task. During the task, the agent must infer, through interactions and observations, how much the human trusts it and adapt its behaviour to maximize the team's performance. To achieve this, we propose collecting data from human participants in experiments to define different settings (based on trust levels) and learning optimal policies for each of them. Then, we create a module to infer the current setting (depending on the amount of trust). Finally, we validate this framework in a real-world scenario and analyse how this adaptable behaviour affects trust.

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning currently focuses on implementations where all data and training can be centralized to one machine. But what if local agents are split across multiple tasks, and need to keep data private between each? We develop the first application of Personalized Federated Hypernetworks (PFH) to Reinforcement Learning (RL). We then present a novel application of PFH to few-shot transfer, and demonstrate significant initial increases in learning. PFH has never been demonstrated beyond supervised learning benchmarks, so we apply PFH to an important domain: RL price-setting for energy demand response. We consider a general case across where agents are split across multiple microgrids, wherein energy consumption data must be kept private within each microgrid. Together, our work explores how the fields of personalized federated learning and RL can come together to make learning efficient across multiple tasks while keeping data secure.

**Abstract:** The application of deep neural networks to remote sensing imagery is often constrained by the lack of ground-truth annotations. Adressing this issue requires models that generalize efficiently from limited amounts of labeled data, allowing us to tackle a wider range of Earth observation tasks. Another challenge in this domain is developing algorithms that operate at variable spatial resolutions, e.g., for the problem of classifying land use at different scales. Recently, self-supervised learning has been applied in the remote sensing domain to exploit readily-available unlabeled data, and was shown to reduce or even close the gap with supervised learning. In this paper, we study self-supervised visual representation learning through the lens of label efficiency, for the task of land use classification on multi-resolution/multi-scale satellite images. We benchmark two contrastive self-supervised methods adapted from Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and provide evidence that these methods can be perform effectively given little downstream supervision, where randomly initialized networks fail to generalize. Moreover, they outperform out-of-domain pretraining alternatives. We use the large-scale fMoW dataset to pretrain and evaluate the networks, and validate our observations with transfer to the RESISC45 dataset.

**Abstract:** Quantum machine learning has shown advantages in many ways compared to classical machine learning. In machine learning, a difficult problem is how to learn a model with high robustness and strong generalization ability from a limited feature space. Combining multiple models as base learners, ensemble learning (EL) can effectively improve the accuracy, generalization ability, and robustness of the final model. The key to EL lies in two aspects, the performance of base learners and the choice of the combination strategy. Recently, quantum EL (QEL) has been studied. However, existing combination strategies in QEL are inadequate in considering the accuracy and variance among base learners. This paper presents a hybrid EL framework that combines quantum and classical advantages. More importantly, we propose an efficient combination strategy for improving the accuracy of classification in the framework. We verify the feasibility and efficiency of our framework and strategy by using the MNIST dataset. Simulation results show that the hybrid EL framework with our combination strategy not only has a higher accuracy and lower variance than the single model without the ensemble, but also has a better accuracy than the majority voting and the weighted voting strategies in most cases.

**Abstract:** An additive autoencoder for dimension reduction, which is composed of a serially performed bias estimation, linear trend estimation, and nonlinear residual estimation, is proposed and analyzed. Computational experiments confirm that an autoencoder of this form, with only a shallow network to encapsulate the nonlinear behavior, is able to identify an intrinsic dimension of a dataset with a low autoencoding error. This observation leads to an investigation in which shallow and deep network structures, and how they are trained, are compared. We conclude that the deeper network structures obtain lower autoencoding errors during the identification of the intrinsic dimension. However, the detected dimension does not change compared to a shallow network.

**Abstract:** Recent research has shown that language models have a tendency to memorize rare or unique sequences in the training corpora which can thus leak sensitive attributes of user data. We employ a teacher-student framework and propose a novel approach called alternating teaching to mitigate unintended memorization in sequential modeling. In our method, multiple teachers are trained on disjoint training sets whose privacy one wishes to protect, and teachers' predictions supervise the training of a student model in an alternating manner at each time step. Experiments on LibriSpeech datasets show that the proposed method achieves superior privacy-preserving results than other counterparts. In comparison with no prevention for unintended memorization, the overall utility loss is small when training records are sufficient.

**Abstract:** Humans tend to drive vehicles efficiently by relying on contextual and spatial information through the sensory organs. Inspired by this, most of the research is focused on how to learn robust and efficient driving policies. These works are mostly categorized as making modular or end-to-end systems for learning driving policies. However, the former approach has limitations due to the manual supervision of specific modules that hinder the scalability of these systems. In this work, we focus on the latter approach to formalize a framework for learning driving policies for end-to-end autonomous driving. In order to take inspiration from human driving, we have proposed a framework that incorporates three RGB cameras (left, right, and center) to mimic the human field of view and top-down semantic information for contextual representation in predicting the driving policies for autonomous driving. The sensor information is fused and encoded by the self-attention mechanism and followed by the auto-regressive waypoint prediction module. The proposed method's efficacy is experimentally evaluated using the CARLA simulator and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest driving score at the evaluation time.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we consider the problem of synthesizing a controller in the presence of uncertainty such that the resulting closed-loop system satisfies certain hard constraints while optimizing certain (soft) performance objectives. We assume that the hard constraints encoding safety or mission-critical task objectives are expressed using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), while performance is quantified using standard cost functions on system trajectories. In order to prioritize the satisfaction of the hard STL constraints, we utilize the framework of control barrier functions (CBFs) and algorithmically obtain CBFs for STL objectives. We assume that the controllers are modeled using neural networks (NNs) and provide an optimization algorithm to learn the optimal parameters for the NN controller that optimize the performance at a user-specified robustness margin for the safety specifications. We use the formalism of risk measures to evaluate the risk incurred by the trade-off between robustness margin of the system and its performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on well-known difficult examples for nonlinear control such as a quad-rotor and a unicycle, where the mission objectives for each system include hard timing constraints and safety objectives.

**Abstract:** Quantum walks on binary trees are used in many quantum algorithms to achieve important speedup over classical algorithms. The formulation of this kind of algorithms as quantum circuit presents the advantage of being easily readable, executable on circuit based quantum computers and simulators and optimal on the usage of resources. We propose a strategy to compose quantum circuit that performs quantum walk on binary trees following universal gate model quantum computation principles. We give a particular attention to NAND formula evaluation algorithm as it could have many applications in game theory and reinforcement learning. We therefore propose an application of this algorithm and show how it can be used to train a quantum reinforcement learning agent in a two player game environment.

**Abstract:** Combining RGB images and the corresponding depth maps in semantic segmentation proves the effectiveness in the past few years. Existing RGB-D modal fusion methods either lack the non-linear feature fusion ability or treat both modal images equally, regardless of the intrinsic distribution gap or information loss. Here we find that depth maps are suitable to provide intrinsic fine-grained patterns of objects due to their local depth continuity, while RGB images effectively provide a global view. Based on this, we propose a pixel differential convolution attention (DCA) module to consider geometric information and local-range correlations for depth data. Furthermore, we extend DCA to ensemble differential convolution attention (EDCA) which propagates long-range contextual dependencies and seamlessly incorporates spatial distribution for RGB data. DCA and EDCA dynamically adjust convolutional weights by pixel difference to enable self-adaptive in local and long range, respectively. A two-branch network built with DCA and EDCA, called Differential Convolutional Network (DCANet), is proposed to fuse local and global information of two-modal data. Consequently, the individual advantage of RGB and depth data are emphasized. Our DCANet is shown to set a new state-of-the-art performance for RGB-D semantic segmentation on two challenging benchmark datasets, i.e., NYUDv2 and SUN-RGBD.

**Abstract:** Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing conspiracy theories were refreshed and new ones were created, often interwoven with antisemitic narratives, stereotypes and codes. The sheer volume of antisemitic and conspiracy theory content on the Internet makes data-driven algorithmic approaches essential for anti-discrimination organizations and researchers alike. However, the manifestation and dissemination of these two interrelated phenomena is still quite under-researched in scholarly empirical research of large text corpora. Algorithmic approaches for the detection and classification of specific contents usually require labeled datasets, annotated based on conceptually sound guidelines. While there is a growing number of datasets for the more general phenomenon of hate speech, the development of corpora and annotation guidelines for antisemitic and conspiracy content is still in its infancy, especially for languages other than English. We contribute to closing this gap by developing an annotation guide for antisemitic and conspiracy theory online content in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide working definitions, including specific forms of antisemitism such as encoded and post-Holocaust antisemitism. We use these to annotate a German-language dataset consisting of ~3,700 Telegram messages sent between 03/2020 and 12/2021.

**Abstract:** Online social platforms have become more and more popular, and the dissemination of information on social networks has attracted wide attention of the industries and academia. Aiming at selecting a small subset of nodes with maximum influence on networks, the Influence Maximization (IM) problem has been extensively studied. Since it is #P-hard to compute the influence spread given a seed set, the state-of-art methods, including heuristic and approximation algorithms, faced with great difficulties such as theoretical guarantee, time efficiency, generalization, etc. This makes it unable to adapt to large-scale networks and more complex applications. With the latest achievements of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in artificial intelligence and other fields, a lot of works has focused on exploiting DRL to solve the combinatorial optimization problems. Inspired by this, we propose a novel end-to-end DRL framework, ToupleGDD, to address the IM problem in this paper, which incorporates three coupled graph neural networks for network embedding and double deep Q-networks for parameters learning. Previous efforts to solve the IM problem with DRL trained their models on the subgraph of the whole network, and then tested their performance on the whole graph, which makes the performance of their models unstable among different networks. However, our model is trained on several small randomly generated graphs and tested on completely different networks, and can obtain results that are very close to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our model is trained with a small budget, and it can perform well under various large budgets in the test, showing strong generalization ability. Finally, we conduct entensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets, and the experimental results prove the effectiveness and superiority of our model.

**Abstract:** Applying graph-based approaches in deep learning receives more attention over time. This study presents statistical analysis on the use of graph-based approaches in deep learning and examines the scientific impact of the related articles. Processing the data obtained from the Web of Science database, metrics such as the type of the articles, funding availability, indexing type, annual average number of citations and the number of access were analyzed to quantitatively reveal the effects on the scientific audience. It's outlined that deep learning-based studies gained momentum after year 2013, and the rate of graph-based approaches in all deep learning studies increased linearly from 1% to 4% within the following 10 years. Conference publications scanned in the Conference Proceeding Citation Index (CPCI) on the graph-based approaches receive significantly more citations. The citation counts of the SCI-Expanded and Emerging SCI indexed publications of the two streams are close to each other. While the citation performances of the supported and unsupported publications of the two sides were similar, pure deep learning studies received more citations on the journal publication side and graph-based approaches received more citations on the conference side. Despite their similar performance in recent years, graph-based studies show twice more citation performance as they get older, compared to traditional approaches. Annual average citation performance per article for all deep learning studies is 11.051 in 2014, while it is 22.483 for graph-based studies. Also, despite receiving 16% more access, graph-based papers get almost the same overall citation over time with the pure counterpart. This is an indication that graph-based approaches need a greater bunch of attention to follow, while pure deep learning counterpart is relatively simpler to get inside.

**Abstract:** Introduction of fifth generation (5G) wireless network technology has matched the crucial need for high capacity and speed needs of the new generation mobile applications. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) also empowered 5G cellular networks with two mainstreams as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Our study aims to uncover the differences in scientific impact for these two techniques by the means of statistical bibliometrics. The performed analysis includes citation performance with respect to indexing types, funding availability, journal or conference publishing options together with distributions of these metrics along years to evaluate the popularity trends in a detailed manner. Web of Science (WoS) database host 2245 papers for ML and 1407 papers for DL-related studies. DL studies, starting with 9% rate in 2013, has reached to 45% rate in 2022 among all DL and ML-related studies. Results related to scientific impact indicate that DL studies get slightly more average normalized citation (2.256) compared to ML studies (2.118) in 5G, while SCI-Expanded indexed papers in both sides tend to have similar citation performance (3.165 and 3.162 respectively). ML-related studies those are indexed in ESCI show twice citation performance compared to DL. Conference papers in DL domain and journal papers in ML domain are superior in scientific interest to their counterparts with minor differences. Highest citation performance for ML studies is achieved for year 2014, while this peak is observed for 2017 for DL studies. We can conclude that both publication and citation rate for DL-related papers tend to increase and outperform ML-based studies in 5G domain by the means of citation metrics.

**Abstract:** We study sequential bilateral trade where sellers and buyers valuations are completely arbitrary (i.e., determined by an adversary). Sellers and buyers are strategic agents with private valuations for the good and the goal is to design a mechanism that maximizes efficiency (or gain from trade) while being incentive compatible, individually rational and budget balanced. In this paper we consider gain from trade which is harder to approximate than social welfare.
  We consider a variety of feedback scenarios and distinguish the cases where the mechanism posts one price and when it can post different prices for buyer and seller. We show several surprising results about the separation between the different scenarios. In particular we show that (a) it is impossible to achieve sublinear $Œ±$-regret for any $Œ±<2$, (b) but with full feedback sublinear $2$-regret is achievable (c) with a single price and partial feedback one cannot get sublinear $Œ±$ regret for any constant $Œ±$ (d) nevertheless, posting two prices even with one-bit feedback achieves sublinear $2$-regret, and (e) there is a provable separation in the $2$-regret bounds between full and partial feedback.
